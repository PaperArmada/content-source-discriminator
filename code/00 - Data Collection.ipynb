       "   'selftext': 'Back in 2009, our company purchased a horribly mismanaged company mostly for their technical ability and their customers.  I was asked to come to the President’s office and meet one of the “crown jewels” of this acquisition was a guy we will call “Fred.”\\n\\nFor background, our IT Department falls under the accounting department and headed by the CFO/Treasurer.  I do not work for or report to the President in any way, but professional courtesy he usually gets what he wants (for the most part.)\\n\\nFred seemed nice enough.  We exchanged pleasantries and the president mentioned that he would be needing a new, beefy, top-of-the-line PCs for this new venture.  I told him “No problem!  Just let me know the specs and I’ll get it done.” and I went on my merry way.\\n\\nLater that day the president asked me to stop back by his office for “a little chat.”\\n\\nTowards the end of the day, I swung by his office. \\n\\nThe president wanted to let me know that Fred and his teams were “really smart” guys and that they would “probably be the IT team” for the company “someday in the future.”  It would be best to really do a good job on this as this guy would likely be my boss at some point in the future.\\n\\nSo I was already kind of bristling at this because, as it stood, I was in charge of IT (even if it was only me and one other guy) and I didn’t like the idea of a demotion.\\n\\nThen he handed me a piece of paper with the specs that Fred wanted and needed “to be able to work properly.”  \\n\\nIt read (going from memory) as follows:\\n\\nHP or Dell Laptop\\nMust have Intel i7-720QM\\nWindows 7 32 Bit\\n32 GB of RAM\\n500 GB HD\\nATI or NVidia graphic card\\n\\nI kind of snickered.  I said “can we call him?”  \\n\\nWe got Fred on the phone.\\n\\n“Fred, did you mean to specify Windows 7 64 Bit?”\\n\\n“No,” says Fred “It has to be 32 bit.  64 Bit won’t work with the applications I use.”\\n\\n“Okay.  So then we’ll drop the memory down to 4 GB.”\\n\\n“No!” says Fred “I need 32 GB or I won’t be able to work efficiently.”\\n\\nSo I tell the “really smart” guy that 32 GB won’t work in a 32 bit system.  \\n\\nHe insists it will, he knows what he needs and what he is doing, and just order it the way he specified.  He can configure it to work just fine.\\n\\nI tell him that I would love to see this (as it basically breaks math.) \\n\\nLong story short, I order it and, Lo and Behold, a 32-bit system can only use 4 GB of memory.  \\n\\nHe tells the president that I must have done something wrong with the set up or something on the network was preventing it from using all 32 GB.\\n\\n*Facepalm*\\n\\nLater in the week my CFO/Boss wants to have a meeting with me to discuss why we cannot configure it the way he wants and what we can do to solve this issue.  So I go to the meeting and my boss asks me “what is preventing you from configuring this the way he wants.”\\n\\n“Math.”\\n\\n“Math?”\\n\\n“Yes, Math.  You see what 32 bit and 64 bit means is how many address registers a computer can access in memory.  32 bit means it can access 2^32 address registers or a little over 4 billion ones and zeros, or 4 gigabites.  That’s it.  It’s not up for debate.  I can stick a hundred sicks of memory in there and it will still only use 4 GB.  It cannot be changed because you cannot change the math.”\\n\\n“Did you explain it to him?”\\n\\n“No, I did not.  Because he said he wanted it that way and he could configure it to work.”\\n\\n“But,” said the CFO, “You said it couldn’t work.  What can he do to make it work?”\\n\\n“Nothing.  Again…math.”\\n\\n\\nIn the end Fred said he would “Just deal with it.”  He lasted about eight months and was asked to leave after he spent $7500 at a Vegas strip club with “clients” one night.\\n\\nApparently, math was never a strong suit of his.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'For backstory i worked for a small tech company. Our largest client was a national franchise so effectively a group of small businesses. Each site was its own franchise but some sites were in their own groups.\\n\\nA few years prior HO had a very basic software and alot of franchises had their own. When we came on the scene these systems were intergrated into ours by the franchises, mostly using our apis, often badly.\\n\\nWhen we first rolled out we were fairly immature company and lacked alot of best pratice guidelines, including how passwords are assigned. (new passwords were all the same (think \"changeme\") and users should change this but at that time we didnt have any enforcement of that.\\n\\nOne unassuming Tuesday our tech support team receives a request to retrive a password. We explain they can reset it automatically but thats not what they want. They want us to tell them their password. Our tech guy explains why we cant do this and ends the call.\\n\\nWe get another call from the same user 20 minutes later asking the same thing. Unfortunately for them we are a small team so it goes to the same tech and he reiterates what he said before and the call ends.\\n\\n10 minutes later we get a call from the users manager, turns out they use the account for lots of users, not all present and that it had previously been saved on all their browsers. We explain that whilst that sucks, theres f all we can do and besides, each user should have their own account.\\n\\nThe convo got a bit heated but the call ends and thats that, or so we think. Around lunchtime we get a call from one of the senior guys at HO, who asks us the exact same thing.\\n\\nWere obviously annoyed that they keep on trying to pull rank and that noone seems to care about security but we listen and he drops a bombshell on us.\\n\\nThey dont actually use our software but a series of their own, both developed in house and bought and stitched together. Their only use for us is to transfer data from HO into their own systems and vice versa. The users with access only use it for more manual tasks and one specifc customer query. \\n\\nThe account in question is used by 8 different applications and its details are hardcoded into the calls. Their only developer is off on a 5 week gaunt in the aussie outback and is completely unreachable. \\n\\nChanging this password would send their business back to the 80s, effectively killing these sites completely. Even lending a dev wouldnt help as their gallivanting dev is the only one with access. \\n\\nAlot of back and forth goes on and we get a senior dev onto the call to explain how we cant access these passwords etc and more talking in the office about it. Dev gets annoyed at me and shows me the database. Thats the passwords all encrypted looking. \\n\\nAs he scrolls we notice something. Alot of the entries look identical (we werent salting them?) including the account in question. \\n\\nThats when it dawns on us. \\n\\nThey never changed the password from the default. A quick login attempt validates this and we give our conclusion to the client and to HO. HO also gets an (absolutely deserved) earful about security and ensuring their sites follow policies from our ceo who is not happy half his company has been dealing with this bullshit for the best part of the day. \\n\\nIn some ways its an utter miracle noone got into their systems. That same password had been sent to tens of thousands of users on our first rollout before we changed the process (randomly generated single use password) \\n\\nYou only needed the email address to get in and that was literally sitename@companyname.com\\n\\nHow that lasted 2 years i shall never know...',\n",

To my surprise all of the terminals are running windows ten. Fast forward a few well and I come into work on a Saturday night. The first thing I notice is that there is no one bowling on a Saturday night in a he spring (for the people that don’t know Saturdays are usually the busiest day of the week for bowling alleys). So I walk up to my manager and say, “hey p, it’s pretty dead isn’t it.” He responds to me explaining that he has had to turn customers away all day because the computers have been acting up. So because I would like to think I’m somewhat tech savvy I ask what the problem was. He says, “the computer has been on a blue screen all day, I immediately assume our system is dead until I check the main terminal’s screen, it turns out that my manager decided that the best time to do a massive backlog of windows updates was in the middle of the day on a Saturday. So in short that’s how we lost hundreds of dollars in revenue because my older manager decided it was update time.',\n",

This particular school has an in-house help desk, so I am in the school all day on call for whatever might go wrong (which is a lot).\\n\\nOne day a teacher sends in a ticket saying the projector is displaying blurry in one of the classrooms. I let her know I\\'m on it and pop in to take a look since the room is free. Turn it on, project all sorts of things, looks perfectly fine to me. I\\'ll give her the benefit of the doubt, though, since I have perfect vision. I pay around and can only get it marginally sharper. Conclude nothing is wrong and go back to my desk.\\n\\nI email the teacher and let them know I played around a bit and to let me know how it looks when they teach in there next. Get an \"Ok I will!\" response. Don\\'t hear anything for two days. Weekend comes and goes. On Monday I still don\\'t hear anything. On Tuesday as I am about to email her I see her walk past the help desk. I yell out into the hallway and ask how the projector is doing. She says she hasn\\'t used it in teaching for a couple days and will let me know.\\n\\nLater that day she sends another ticket to the help desk that just says \"Can someone come look at the projector\". We have a general rule about not going out to look at things in classrooms without some information on the issue first. We want to be able to bring the right equipment with us and since we are a small department supporting about 1,000 users, if you don\\'t tell us what is going on we aren\\'t going to prioritize you. I respond asking a couple questions to try and determine the issue. Don\\'t hear anything back.\\n\\nAt the end of the school day she responds to my message saying the blurry was still an issue. As I\\'m thinking about what could be happening and developing some more troubleshooting steps to try, she sends me another message. She says it\\'s no rush to get it worked on. In fact, it might not even be an issue at all. It\\'s much better **when** **I put my glasses on.**\\n\\nI stared at my screen for a good two minutes trying to process that statement. I respond saying that might help and to let me know if she has any issues.\\n\\nMark ticket as user error. Close ticket. Wish for a handle of something hard to magically appear on my desk.\\n\\nI wish I could say this sort of thing is rare at this school, but I\\'d be very wrong. Maybe that\\'s why they have an in-house help desk.',\n",
