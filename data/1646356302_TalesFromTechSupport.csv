SonDontPlay,"""Where is the router?""","A General Officer calls in for urgent tech support, he has a conference call with other senior leaders in 45 minutes and he's unable to connect to the internet. Initial attempts are made at diagnosing the problem remotely, however he insists a technician be sent over right away. Since he's got stars he gets what he wants a technician is dispatched.

Tech arrives at residence, immediately notices there is no connection to the computer. Tech asks the General where the router is, General is a bit confused, Tech explains the router is the the box that connects to the internet. General says ""Ah its in the living room""

Tech and General go into living room, the router is not where its supposed to be. Tech asks the General where is the router. The General is unsure, says maybe his wife knows. He has to call the wife as she's not present. 

General is calling the wife, wife answers ""Honey, did you move the box the internet comes in?"" the wife responds, the Generals thanks his wife for the information, opens up a drawer and pulls out the router. 

The wife unplugged the router because the blinking light was disturbing her TV watching experience earlier in the day. The tech plugged in the router and the General had internet connection and was able to join his call on time. The tech thinking ahead, taped over the lights and told the General he covered the lights with tape, but if he ever has an issue remember to take off the tape so they can help diagnose the problem.",talesfromtechsupport,1183,1638946522
talbourne,With users like this...,"I'll be staying at this company for a long time..

User called in last week about an issue with outlook, so per usual i offered to remote in to see if there were errors, maybe enable logging to see what's up. When i connected i noticed her connection was very slow, we did a speed test, she was getting 4Mbps down.. \*shudder\*. I suggested she swap her computer to 5ghz bandwidth and let her other devices stay on the 2.4 band..

She messages me today:

&gt;G'day to you! Just wanted to say **thank you** for saying something about my connection speed last week. Made some tweaks to our linksys wifi extenders and this is what my work laptop looks like today: 128Mbps Down, 6Mbps Up  
&gt;  
&gt;And for all this time I thought that \~5mpbs speed was just the way it was. Woof. 

People like this is one of the big things that separates this employer from places I've been before, people here show appreciation for support staff!",talesfromtechsupport,1634,1638904166
edhands,Math...what a concept,"Back in 2009, our company purchased a horribly mismanaged company mostly for their technical ability and their customers.  I was asked to come to the President’s office and meet one of the “crown jewels” of this acquisition was a guy we will call “Fred.”

For background, our IT Department falls under the accounting department and headed by the CFO/Treasurer.  I do not work for or report to the President in any way, but professional courtesy he usually gets what he wants (for the most part.)

Fred seemed nice enough.  We exchanged pleasantries and the president mentioned that he would be needing a new, beefy, top-of-the-line PCs for this new venture.  I told him “No problem!  Just let me know the specs and I’ll get it done.” and I went on my merry way.

Later that day the president asked me to stop back by his office for “a little chat.”

Towards the end of the day, I swung by his office. 

The president wanted to let me know that Fred and his teams were “really smart” guys and that they would “probably be the IT team” for the company “someday in the future.”  It would be best to really do a good job on this as this guy would likely be my boss at some point in the future.

So I was already kind of bristling at this because, as it stood, I was in charge of IT (even if it was only me and one other guy) and I didn’t like the idea of a demotion.

Then he handed me a piece of paper with the specs that Fred wanted and needed “to be able to work properly.”  

It read (going from memory) as follows:

HP or Dell Laptop
Must have Intel i7-720QM
Windows 7 32 Bit
32 GB of RAM
500 GB HD
ATI or NVidia graphic card

I kind of snickered.  I said “can we call him?”  

We got Fred on the phone.

“Fred, did you mean to specify Windows 7 64 Bit?”

“No,” says Fred “It has to be 32 bit.  64 Bit won’t work with the applications I use.”

“Okay.  So then we’ll drop the memory down to 4 GB.”

“No!” says Fred “I need 32 GB or I won’t be able to work efficiently.”

So I tell the “really smart” guy that 32 GB won’t work in a 32 bit system.  

He insists it will, he knows what he needs and what he is doing, and just order it the way he specified.  He can configure it to work just fine.

I tell him that I would love to see this (as it basically breaks math.) 

Long story short, I order it and, Lo and Behold, a 32-bit system can only use 4 GB of memory.  

He tells the president that I must have done something wrong with the set up or something on the network was preventing it from using all 32 GB.

*Facepalm*

Later in the week my CFO/Boss wants to have a meeting with me to discuss why we cannot configure it the way he wants and what we can do to solve this issue.  So I go to the meeting and my boss asks me “what is preventing you from configuring this the way he wants.”

“Math.”

“Math?”

“Yes, Math.  You see what 32 bit and 64 bit means is how many address registers a computer can access in memory.  32 bit means it can access 2^32 address registers or a little over 4 billion ones and zeros, or 4 gigabites.  That’s it.  It’s not up for debate.  I can stick a hundred sicks of memory in there and it will still only use 4 GB.  It cannot be changed because you cannot change the math.”

“Did you explain it to him?”

“No, I did not.  Because he said he wanted it that way and he could configure it to work.”

“But,” said the CFO, “You said it couldn’t work.  What can he do to make it work?”

“Nothing.  Again…math.”


In the end Fred said he would “Just deal with it.”  He lasted about eight months and was asked to leave after he spent $7500 at a Vegas strip club with “clients” one night.

Apparently, math was never a strong suit of his.",talesfromtechsupport,870,1629488107
12altoids34,I'll have you know I've been working on computers for 10 years ....,"Thats how the call started. 

Then she went on to tell me how she wasn't going to be talked to like some child.

'This is gonna go great ' I moaned internally.

Her computer was running slow. We ran through a few things and I asked her to shut down her pc and let me know when it was off.

About 4 seconds later she tells me 'okay its off '

Impossible . 

I ask her to turn it on again and let me know when we get back to the desktop.

3 seconds later 'okay its back up.'

'Ma'am can you tell me exactly how your shutting down your computer ?'

Here it comes... she launches into a tirade about how she works on a computer every day at work and blah blah blah for about 5 minutes.

' I understand ma'am and I'm simply asking the steps to verify you are taking the proper procedure for THIS computer'


'Of course I am.i push the button on the computer.'

'Is that the computer where you see the images or under your desk ?'

'What do you mean ? Thats a stupid question.  The computer where the information  comes up

I take a deep breath.

'Ma'am thats not the computer. That's your monitor.'

'What ? Your not making sense. Thats how we all shut down our computers at work.'

I explain that at work she doesn't have a computer, but a workstation on a network. I explain that turning off the monitor does not affect the pc at all. Then I walk her through proper shutdown procedures and we reboot her pc.

When it reboots it installs several updates including multiple driver updates. 

'Hey ! You fixed the colors '

Gingrpenguin,We need you to tell us our current password. No not reset tell us. We must have that exact password.,"For backstory i worked for a small tech company. Our largest client was a national franchise so effectively a group of small businesses. Each site was its own franchise but some sites were in their own groups.

A few years prior HO had a very basic software and alot of franchises had their own. When we came on the scene these systems were intergrated into ours by the franchises, mostly using our apis, often badly.

When we first rolled out we were fairly immature company and lacked alot of best pratice guidelines, including how passwords are assigned. (new passwords were all the same (think ""changeme"") and users should change this but at that time we didnt have any enforcement of that.

One unassuming Tuesday our tech support team receives a request to retrive a password. We explain they can reset it automatically but thats not what they want. They want us to tell them their password. Our tech guy explains why we cant do this and ends the call.

We get another call from the same user 20 minutes later asking the same thing. Unfortunately for them we are a small team so it goes to the same tech and he reiterates what he said before and the call ends.

10 minutes later we get a call from the users manager, turns out they use the account for lots of users, not all present and that it had previously been saved on all their browsers. We explain that whilst that sucks, theres f all we can do and besides, each user should have their own account.

The convo got a bit heated but the call ends and thats that, or so we think. Around lunchtime we get a call from one of the senior guys at HO, who asks us the exact same thing.

Were obviously annoyed that they keep on trying to pull rank and that noone seems to care about security but we listen and he drops a bombshell on us.

They dont actually use our software but a series of their own, both developed in house and bought and stitched together. Their only use for us is to transfer data from HO into their own systems and vice versa. The users with access only use it for more manual tasks and one specifc customer query. 

The account in question is used by 8 different applications and its details are hardcoded into the calls. Their only developer is off on a 5 week gaunt in the aussie outback and is completely unreachable. 

Changing this password would send their business back to the 80s, effectively killing these sites completely. Even lending a dev wouldnt help as their gallivanting dev is the only one with access. 

Alot of back and forth goes on and we get a senior dev onto the call to explain how we cant access these passwords etc and more talking in the office about it. Dev gets annoyed at me and shows me the database. Thats the passwords all encrypted looking. 

As he scrolls we notice something. Alot of the entries look identical (we werent salting them?) including the account in question. 

Thats when it dawns on us. 

They never changed the password from the default. A quick login attempt validates this and we give our conclusion to the client and to HO. HO also gets an (absolutely deserved) earful about security and ensuring their sites follow policies from our ceo who is not happy half his company has been dealing with this bullshit for the best part of the day. 

In some ways its an utter miracle noone got into their systems. That same password had been sent to tens of thousands of users on our first rollout before we changed the process (randomly generated single use password) 

You only needed the email address to get in and that was literally sitename@companyname.com

How that lasted 2 years i shall never know...",talesfromtechsupport,682,1623769022
nerdfury83,User needs help not having to do her job?,"I get a call from a user telling me that she's got an issue with her computer locking her out every 15 minutes. She's your average non-IT savvy user so I'm going through the usual open and closed ended questions trying to work out if I'm checking her active directory account, her VIP access credentials, or if her citrix desktop is timing out sooner than the usual 30 minute idle time.

Turns out it's none of them - she means her auto PC lock.

I ask her why she wants to change that, and turns out she's working for the evening in some capacity that requires her to monitor a queue, but it's at night and she - in her own words - ""don't want to have to press a button every 10-15 minutes to stop the computer locking.""

So I ask her why she would need to do that - just working would prevent that from being needed? She'd just need to unlock the PC after breaks, surely? She says no, she just wants to be able to go into the other room and watch TV and just check on it on occasion.

Now, without telling a user to suck it up and just do what they're paid to do, how to you communicate that sentiment?

I politely tell her that we really can't change the setting because it's set by corporate policy. I explain it's a security measure that provides a first line of defense against unauthorised access if her laptop gets stolen. I ask if she has other work to do between that time and 8pm to keep her PC unlocked - she claims there's not.

I suggest ""Usually when we're bored on weekends, we find work to occupy ourselves or ask the boss what needs doing over the weekend since we're being paid to work.""

(truth is, we watch a LOT of YouTube on the weekends!)

She didn't leave happy with my suggestion.",talesfromtechsupport,944,1623764142
passerine_crypt,You have cancer and almost passed out waiting? Then you shouldn't be here at all.,"I recently started working at my local electronics store, and one day whilst I was doing resets of returned computers there was an elderly man sitting on one of the waiting chairs and asked me if I could queue him in for tech support (It was me and like 3 others, we're very short-staffed). I asked him if he had an appointment and he said no, he just told me about how he ""had cancer"" and ""almost passed out waiting for us."" I hadn't been properly trained just yet and so asked one of my higher-ups to take care of him.

I overheard the conversation that ensued, and the man said again that he had cancer and almost passed out waiting, but my higher-up saw through him and said that if he's prone to passing out simply sitting and waiting, then that's an urgent medical issue and he should see a doctor, as a tech store is the last place he wants to be if he does pass out.

Austistic-man,The joys of the bowling desk,"So I have worked in bowling alleys for years but recently got hired in a new place with a shiny new setup for the computer side of things. To my surprise all of the terminals are running windows ten. Fast forward a few well and I come into work on a Saturday night. The first thing I notice is that there is no one bowling on a Saturday night in a he spring (for the people that don’t know Saturdays are usually the busiest day of the week for bowling alleys). So I walk up to my manager and say, “hey p, it’s pretty dead isn’t it.” He responds to me explaining that he has had to turn customers away all day because the computers have been acting up. So because I would like to think I’m somewhat tech savvy I ask what the problem was. He says, “the computer has been on a blue screen all day, I immediately assume our system is dead until I check the main terminal’s screen, it turns out that my manager decided that the best time to do a massive backlog of windows updates was in the middle of the day on a Saturday. So in short that’s how we lost hundreds of dollars in revenue because my older manager decided it was update time.",talesfromtechsupport,696,1623603070

kxavier14,Try troubleshooting a little further before you call us next time,"I work tech support in a school. This particular school has an in-house help desk, so I am in the school all day on call for whatever might go wrong (which is a lot).

One day a teacher sends in a ticket saying the projector is displaying blurry in one of the classrooms. I let her know I'm on it and pop in to take a look since the room is free. Turn it on, project all sorts of things, looks perfectly fine to me. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt, though, since I have perfect vision. I pay around and can only get it marginally sharper. Conclude nothing is wrong and go back to my desk.

I email the teacher and let them know I played around a bit and to let me know how it looks when they teach in there next. Get an ""Ok I will!"" response. Don't hear anything for two days. Weekend comes and goes. On Monday I still don't hear anything. On Tuesday as I am about to email her I see her walk past the help desk. I yell out into the hallway and ask how the projector is doing. She says she hasn't used it in teaching for a couple days and will let me know.

Later that day she sends another ticket to the help desk that just says ""Can someone come look at the projector"". We have a general rule about not going out to look at things in classrooms without some information on the issue first. We want to be able to bring the right equipment with us and since we are a small department supporting about 1,000 users, if you don't tell us what is going on we aren't going to prioritize you. I respond asking a couple questions to try and determine the issue. Don't hear anything back.

At the end of the school day she responds to my message saying the blurry was still an issue. As I'm thinking about what could be happening and developing some more troubleshooting steps to try, she sends me another message. She says it's no rush to get it worked on. In fact, it might not even be an issue at all. It's much better **when** **I put my glasses on.**

I stared at my screen for a good two minutes trying to process that statement. I respond saying that might help and to let me know if she has any issues.

fool2074,My job should NOT involve nudity and lasers! (SFW I promise),"**Please be gentle as this is my first ever post on here, and its a long one maybe even of epic length, but I think it’s also a story that needs to be told.**

About 7 or 8 years back I was working as the entire IT department for a small chain of medical clinics in the Pacific Northwest US.  This chain of clinics was a boutique service where they catered to wealthy patients and were trying to add new cosmetic services in addition to the regular care offered.  To that end they got themselves a fancy new laser assisted liposuction machine. This machine had a laser attached to the tip that would melt fatty tissue without interacting with surrounding muscle, veins, or connective tissue.  It meant they could feed a much smaller tube into the incision and suck the liquefied fat out while doing significantly less damage to the non-fatty tissue resulting in less bruising and a way faster recovery. Very cool.

Now this particular machine was made by Palomar, and the surgical tips with the laser emitter were proprietary to Palomar and had an RF ID chip embedded in each one with an ID number.  Before the machine would activate you had to scan the RF ID chip and once the machine verified that you had a valid tip, it would activate for a few hours to allow you to perform the surgery then deactivate that serial number so no one could reuse the same tip in two surgeries and to validate the part was a genuine tip from Palomar and not some knock off part.

Now just before they were going to do their first live procedure Palomar sent a firmware update for the liposuction machine, and by sent I mean they literally mailed an old school clunky compact flash card with the update on it. It was at this point that I became involved in this circus. The CEO called me and told me I needed to install the firmware update on the new liposuction machine before its inaugural surgery.

Now like most IT guys for smaller operations, I am a generalist by necessity, I’ve done everything from physical infrastructure, to migrating physical servers to virtual machines, to user level support, to running project management on developing their in-house electronic medical records system, building business analytics with SSRS… But laser assisted liposuction machines is WAAAY outside of my wheelhouse.  I explained to the CEO that, there is in fact a very specialized breed of nerd you use to service and maintain expensive computerized surgical equipment, and those nerds make significantly more money than my variety does, to reflect the very specialized training they have received.

&gt;He responded “it’s designed so doctors can figure it out, you should be fine.”  

So I shrugged, took the clunky memory card and went to find the flesh melting laser. True to his word, it was not a complicated procedure.  Big clunky card slot in the back of the machine, fit the big clunky card.  I plug the card in, plug the machine in, and turn it on.  On powering up the machine booted from the memory card and loaded the firmware update automatically. I watched the various load messages; no obvious errors pop up it finishes its install and instructs me to pull the card out and restart. I follow direction and low and behold the machine boots up to a fancy full color menu.

“Hurray, that went pretty easy.” I thought, but this was not my first rodeo, and while I don’t know anything about laser assisted liposuction machines, I do know not to trust a patch in a production environment without some testing first.  So I go to the doctor who’s supposed to be performing surgery with this thing in a few days and I said to her, “Hey doc, I’ve got that update loaded in the Palomar machine, it looks like it went fine but, I don’t really know what fine looks like on there, so you should definitely turn it on, activate a tip and make sure the laser is working, that it’s sucking, and doing all the things it’s supposed to do before you actually try to use it.”  She assured me that she would, and I left and went on with my life blissfully unaware that, she’d lied.

A few days later I’m having a regular boring day when I get a panicked call from my CEO that I’m needed in the new operating room right now. My heart sank, and I knew I wanted no part of what was about to transpire. 

&gt;“What’s going on?” I asked. 

&gt;“There’s something wrong with the liposuction machine and we need you to take a look at it.”

&gt;“I am not remotely qualified to troubleshoot a laser liposuction machine.” I replied, “I’d have no idea where to even begin.”


&gt;“You’re all we’ve got so get in there and try.”


Dutifully, I went. 


When I arrived there was a naked woman laying on the operating table. She had a sterile drape over her for modesty and hovering over her with the Palomar machine was the doctor and her nurse in full surgical gowns, masks, gloves the works.  I on the other hand had no earthly business in that room in my business casual attire and beard. 


Now the naked woman had already been prepped for surgery.  That doesn’t just mean she was naked and sterilized, oh no. When you go in for liposuction they prepare you by injecting large amounts of saline mixed with lidocaine into all the tissues they intend to remove. The lidocaine numbs the tissue and saline is injected to bloat things up, loosen the tissue and create room and pressure for the vacuum hose and surgical tip.  Even if they do nothing more than prep you, you’re going to be numb, bruised, and spend days recovering; so It’s not a small thing, once you’ve prepped the patient, you’re pretty committed to doing the surgery.


&gt;Trying to sound like this was the most normal thing I’d done all day I asked the doctor, “What’s going on?”  


&gt;“The tips won’t activate.” The doctor replied. “I wave it over the sensor here and it just does nothing.”


&gt;“Alright.” I answer, and walk over to the table to look at the machine.  

Looks pretty normal to me, she’s deeper into the menus than I’d ever gone when I did the update but there’s no warnings, no errors, the fans are humming everything looks like it should be working as near as I can see.  I reboot the machine and ask her to try again. (I have no idea how to get to the part where it activates the tips.) She navigates the menu to begin the surgery and waves the tip over the sensor.  Nothing.


&gt;“Have you tried another surgical tip, maybe that one is faulty.” I say.


&gt;“I really don’t want to do that.” She says, “We’ll have to discard them both when this is over if I do.”


&gt;“I think we’re kind of at the point where you need to try it.” I reply. So, she gets another tip and waves it over the sensor, still nothing.


I shut the machine down, plug in the firmware card again, and re-load the new firmware.  Once again it loads smoothly as near as I can tell, and after it boots up again it looks normal, so I ask her to try again with both the tips.  No dice.


I’m officially at the end of my generic troubleshooting 101 quiver at this point, so I call the 800 number on the machine.


I get a Palomar tech support rep on the phone and explain what’s going on.  He asks me to reboot the machine, to re-load the firmware and report any errors that come up during load, and asks me to try swapping out the tips.  I dutifully repeat the trouble shooting steps with him because I understand users lie and you can’t trust them even if they tell you they tried it.  We get through the obvious stuff while the poor naked lady is still miserably laying bloated and numb on the table next to me and I’m doing my best to pretend she’s a potted plant that should not be looked at directly.


&gt;Finally the Palomar rep says, “Okay, I think we need to try to remove and reseat the sensor Diode assembly.  If you look at the bottom front of the sensor panel, you’ll see a release button.  Press it down and pull up firmly on the sensor assembly.” 


So I push the button down give the flat sensor panel a firm tug and sure enough, it pops right out and lifts away from the machine dripping clear fluid out of the bottom of the newly released panel and dribbling it all over the floor and my shoes. 


&gt;“It appears to be leaking some clear fluid.” I remark.


&gt;To which the Polmar rep calmly retorts, “That’s just a natural biproduct of the machine, nothing to worry about.” 


&gt;At which point I reply with growing alarm, “By definition machines do not have ‘natural by products’ please tell me what the human fat melting laser machine is leaking onto my shoes.” I was pretty sure it wasn’t actually human fat, as no one had, as of yet, ever used this particular machine, but I really wanted a straight answer, so I was being a tad hyperbolic at this point.


&gt;“Distilled water and alcohol, now please plug the diode assembly back into the machine, and restart it.” He replied.


I did as instructed and we once again attempted to activate a surgical tip, but still nothing happened.  


&gt;“Yeah, looks like you probably have a bad diode assembly, we’ll ship you out another one right away.” The rep says.


&gt;“How long will that take?” I quietly ask, realizing the full magnitude of the situation.


&gt;“Three business days.” He says.


&gt;“Thank you.” I tell him and hang up the phone. 

I motion for the doctor to join me in the hallway and she reluctantly does so.  Waiting worriedly in the hall for a status update is the CEO and head of operations.


&gt;“You get it working?” asks the CEO.


&gt;“I’m afraid not, there’s a bad part that will need to be replaced. The new part should arrive in about 3 days.”


&gt;The doctor grows a little pale and says, “But I have a patient on the table right now! She’s already been prepped.”


&gt;“Yes, I know, but there’s nothing I can do for you until that part arrives.”


&gt;Everyone looks a little sick at this point, and the doctor groans, “I really don’t want to have to tell her we have to cancel the surgery.“


&gt;I nodded sympathetically and said “The thing I can’t understand, is how the Diode could have gone out in the three days since you tested it. I mean no one has used it, it probably wasn’t even plugged in. You did activate a tip after the firmware update like I told you to, right?”


&gt;The doctor looks at the CEO and operations chief and says, “We didn’t want to waste one, they’re like 250 dollars each.”


&gt;“Huh,” I say and ask in return, “and how much would you guys be willing to pay right now to NOT be in this situation?” Then I started backing slowly out of their executive huddle and say, “Sorry I can’t do more for you, but unless someone has something computer related they need from me, I’m going to go because this is really uncomfortable and I am no longer useful to this process. Good luck.” And fled back to my office.


Ultimately, they had to take the patient to recovery and then send her home un-lipo-sucked. Luckily for the company, she was a volunteer from an employee’s family, not a paying customer. They had offered her the procedure for free because nobody wants to pay good money for the privilege of being a doctors first solo liposuction.  She eventually did return after the part arrived and got her free liposuction. I was mercifully not involved that time.


The Doctor didn’t last another year with the company, and as she was the only one they’d paid to have trained for liposuction the machine ended up collecting dust in a closet.

Piltdownton_Abbey,You never told us how to exit your software so we hold down the power button.,"This customer has been using our software for over 25 years. Recently they've been experiencing a lot of data corruption. Their IT company is pretty good and they investigated and were able to determine that they exit our software by turning off the computers running our software (Holding down the power button until it turns off). This includes the server, which is honestly a WTF for us. So a person opens the application on the server (very ill advised) and rather than close the application, they hold down the power button and then power it back on.

When the IT company questioned them about this they told them that we have often told them not to do this but since we never told them how to correctly exit the application, they had no other choice. I don't specifically remember telling them not to do this but it's in our online help and if asked during a call we'd certainly tell them not to do it.  Admittedly exiting our software is confusing. We only provide them with an X at the top right and then the massively confusing ""File -&gt; Exit"". Both the IT company and us are shocked at their response considering that the 2 top employees were there when our software was installed and many have been there more than 10 years. It's been more than we week and we're still trying to come to terms with how a customer thinks this is ok and acts shocked when told this is causing data corruption.",talesfromtechsupport,3009,1614799500
SpinachSpinosaurus,"""Customer Failed To Reboot"" - Collection","This is a thread about the weirdest customer interaction I had.  English isn't my native language, 🐻  with me :) 

&amp;#x200B;

* Multiple customers calling in for Internet not functioning. Checking the system if their router is online. It isn't. Told the Customer so and ask them to go through the routine precidure with me, which is checking if the cable are actually correctly connected, LED Status, the end device he wants to be connected to ect. On my side it also involves if ther's a there a larger issue in their area. So start asking away:

me: ""please check the cable connection box. In which port did you put the cable into?""

Customer: ""Cable?""  me: ""yes, the cable that is connected with the Router.""

Customer: \*really confident and patronizing\* ""It's a wireless Router, it doesn't need cables!""

me: \*thinking\* what? I thought these were jokes during training.... ""Sir, that's correct. At the same time, your router still needs to receive the signal first and won't get it without having a connection to the connection box that's mounted to the wall. Please check the box for the correct cable. There is also a pictured instruction included. I will walk you to the process of con-""

customer: ""why do I need a cable when it's wireless Internet?!""

me: ""it's wireless internet because you don't need a cable to connect your router with your end device you want to use the internet with

customer: \*rants about false marketing\*

me: ""Please Sir, I am here to help you getting your device online. While the system boots, we can have a chat about technical standards if you're interested. It's a really fascinating topic!

customer: ""why do I have to do this?""

me: ""Do you like gardening?""

customer: proud: ""yes! but what des this have to do with the internet?

me: ""imagine the internet is your water supply and you want to water your plants. The hose is the cable, the plants your end device. The water is ""wireless"", when it exits your hose, but up to that point, you still need the hose to disperse the ""signal"", which is the water.""

customer was quiet for a moment and then responded with: ""soooo....which one is the correct hose?""

&amp;#x200B;

Had some variation of this thing. the cherry on top was the person that just pulled out the router out of the box and set it up. called in for not having internet.

I was already aware of DAUs (Dümmster anzunehmender User- the German equivalent to luser ), so I started with the whole cable story right away

Kareniva (Kevina + Karen) dug into me with how I can say something so stupid when it's OBVIOUS it's wireless tech.

I interrupted her rant (I am rude, I know, but I am not the person that accepts my AHT getting burnt by ruder person) by saying: ""Ma'm, you're right, it's tech. Just like your TV, Toaster and Microwave oven. They run on electrical power. And your TV is connected to the cable outlet box so you get the signal of the channel you want to watch from the ""outside world"". The internet is the same. The wireless option exists between your end device and your router. Now, if you would be so kind to allow me to help me to walk you through connecting the router to your connection box ports so we can get to to the internet to check upon Tesla?

Kareniva: That's the guy who builds these cars. Why would I check him?

me: I am sorry ma'm, that's Elon Musk who named his car after the man. Nikolas Tesla wanted wireless power outlets. He got mocked by Edision who implemented wired electricity. We can blame him, if you want. Because I think the idea of not having to deal with all these cables in my apartment very appeasing. Now, is the box where the router came in still within reach? .....

(note: Kareniva agreed to my sentiment and told me, that was actually her way of thinking when she heard ""wireless"". i told her at least she has ONE cable less with that thing. She went full Wireless Lan and was very happy to get some tips on the way with that)

&amp;#x200B;

* last one (there is still more lol) since this was getting longer than expected:

2 incidents, really.

Some lady called in. Router blinking, no internet. This time, I started at the router to walk back to the outlet (Cut me a slack, I don't want to have the same talk every call, I need some changes once in a while xD)

All is fine and well, until I ask her to check the outlet.

her: that's a bit difficult.

me: how so?

her: it's behind the Sofa and that thing is superheavy. I had my 2 brothers and my dad shoving that thing in my living room and they were sweating af

me: ....\*stop thinking something naughty, guuurl\* I understand that. We do need to check that, thou. I cannot even send you a technician to check the connection box if we don't check it. And even after the fact, they are not allowed to shove interior around by company rules. do you think you can move it a little to light the box with a flashlight to check it or even being able to grab the end of the cable and push it in a little bit? I promise you, I will wait for your feedback.

her: ok. \*puts phone down\*

meanwhile I am listening to a lady, cussing her sofa out for being goddamn heavy and a piece of comfy and expensive trash. I am very amused at this point.

her: \*gets back to the phone, heavy breathing\* Listen, you won't believe this!

me: What happened?

her: I wasn't here for the whole day. And when I left this morning, I still had a connection.

me: you told me.

her: the cable wasn't plugged into the connection port. it was on the ground. How did this happen? I wasn't there the whole day and I had a connection THIS MORNING? WTH happened?!

me: did you put it back?

her: yes. and it's working again! I am so spooked now!

me: it's probably nothing serious. maybe it wasn't fully plugged in.

meanwhile, I am thinking of all the threads in r/LetsNotMeet where people lived in walls or all the paranormal threads in r/AskReddit

&amp;#x200B;

a couple months laterI get this annoyed lady who tells the story of her internet being on and off most of the time, continously losing connection and a very bad wi-fi.

I walk her through the steps, again, starting with the router (yes, yes xD)

All fine, until we are about to check the connection outlet, she suddenly refuses. She has guests over and they are sitting on the sofa. The connection box is right behind the sofa.

I cheerfully tell her the story of this other lady.

her: ""stop taking me for a ride! you just pulled that story out of thin air!""

me: M'am, I could never come up with something like that. I think it's very rude to lie to a customer, even if it's for a weird story. We really need to have a short look on that outlet so I gather all information needed if I have to send you a technician to fix the problem.

her: there are 8 people sitting on that sofa. I just don't see want them standing around while I pull that  large and heavy sofa so I can check what's behind.

At this point, I assume she is concerned about being seen as a bad host that disturbs her guests comfort for something so small.

me: Ma'm, excuse me if I appear to be rude now. I think your guests won't be too concerned or holding a grudge for too long if you have them stand for a short moment. Especially with such a considerate and kind host like you.

her: .....you're smooth as butter, you know that?

me: I am just telling the truth, ma'm. I am obligiged by my own principles to be honest.

there was a short silence in the line.

her: (out of nowhere) NO WAY!

me: I was correct, wasn't it?

her:YES!  I really thought you take me for a ride after telling that story. But no, we just plugged the cable back into the connection port. What?

me: That's good, but I meant your guests happily giving up their comfort to their considerat host for a moment or two.

her: that, too. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I stop here cause it's too long, lol. If you want more, just ask me :)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL, DR: ALWAYS check from the wall to the router first if the LEDs on the router are blinking! Check from Router to power outlet if it doesn't. There are stupid people and heavy sofas out there!

Edit 1: thank you kind stranger for the  Award. First one on reddit OTL

Edit 2: since they are a lot of question how the network in my Country (Germany) works, I am stealing u/1Mandolo1's answer:

&lt; Yes and no (there's also a German word for that, ""Jein"" which is a combination of Ja and Nein, the German words for yes and no). There are wired and wireless signals. Typically, you get your internet connection through a wire in the ground into your house. You can theoretically turn that signal into a wireless signal at almost any point, but it has to be converted from a wired signal first. And that is literally what wireless routers are for.

ETA: And also, power supply is independent from data connection. You will always need to supply electrical and electronic devices with current, which, while technically possible with wireless means, for a variety of reasons is best done with a wired connection. That's why you still need to plug your wireless router twice - once into the power supply, and once into the internet port.&gt;

younhacomet,"Customer support made a mistake, the client ended the call extremely happy","I used to work for a call center company and our account was a prepaid cellphone company... let's call Celfon... as a general cust support and as a 'tech support'. At the time of the story, I was new and it was my very first job. Please keep in mind that this happened like 10+ years ago and some details may have been omitted.

The company trained us for around one month IIRC and then allowed us to take actual calls for one week with our trainer and QC at our beck and call if we had any calls that doesn't follow the script. The training took a while because Celfon also handles a charity cellphone service (CCS from hereon) for people who are in need (mostly old or poor people). We were told the government pays for the service. So the training basically was about learning the different policies and procedures of Celfon and CCS.

This story is not what happened to me but to my fellow new employee (we were trained by batch).

Anyway, this co-trainee of mine got a call from a client of the CCS. The client didn't receive his monthly minute allowance so he called to ask what's up. Upon checking the entries/records of the client, the minutes did, in fact, not send to the client's phone and has to be manually sent by my co-trainee, and she did so by following the script. And then she clicked \[Send\] on her screen and asked the client if he received a message saying he got his minutes. The client said he received a message but it doesn't say he received minutes. I don't know if she double-checked the entries after that but she got confused and asked our trainer for help. Our trainer said to start over and send the minutes again and she did. I was sitting next to my co-trainee. I was on call, got my client on hold, and was waiting for my system to finish whatever I was doing at that time and started to watch. I watched her click on \[Send\] again and asked the customer if he received his minutes. The client said he did receive a message but, again, no minutes (BTW I couldn't hear him, my co-trainee was relaying what the client said to the trainer). My trainer was a little perplexed as well and reviewed what my co-trainee did that the minutes wouldn't send. Then our trainer found what's wrong. The client was indeed NOT receiving his manually inputted minutes. He was receiving DAYS. Mind you he was in the 300+ MINUTE PER MONTH program. My co-trainee gave him 300+ DAYS worth of minutes. TWICE. It was a dropbox choice mistake. She clicked on the DAY option instead of MINUTE.

Needless to say, my co-trainee was scared about the mistake. Our trainer just said, ""Nothing we can do about it. Just inform the client and close it as normal. Just mention what happened in the note ticket."" The client was extremely happy about what happened. He received close to 2 YEARS WORTH OF MINUTES within the span of a 15-minute call plus the monthly 300+ minutes he'll continue to receive every month. And there I was, still waiting for my system to finish, thinking what a lucky bastard that guy was.",talesfromtechsupport,1416,1614433909
insanitychasesme,Work just keeps on surprising me!,"Quick Intro - I work at a small hospital in the middle of nowhere.  Yay!

A user flagged me down in the hallway earlier this week, complaining a computer wouldn't start up for them.  They led me into a back office that I'd never been in before (I didn't even know it was an office) and showed me their ""dead"" computer.

The Win95 splash screen started back at me from an equally ancient monitor.  

Well, that's a relic.

User: ""I booted it up yesterday and it's been like this ever since.  I can't get to the desktop!""

I told the user it was dead and pretty much unsalvageable.  There was much gnashing of teeth because there were ""important files"" on there.  Their boss got involved.  Then my boss got involved.  A very circular conversation went on and on and on.  

My boss' final decision - remove the old beast from the hospital, rip out its hard drive, and put it out of its misery.  (Our dept SLA states we don't support anything that is over so many years old.)

I borrowed a cart, loaded both the computer and monitor on it while the user glared at me, and brought it back to the IT office to show off to my coworkers.  They were amazed that old relic had been missed in our multiple sweeps of the buildings.  (""Wait....what office?!?!?!?  Where was it hiding?"")

inkbladder,There’s a ghost!!!,"TLDR at the bottom. 

I’m an “IT Professional” and work for a major university in the Southeastern United States, I am a one man show for two sites with about 90 employees and 100 students. 

If it’s got a plug on the user side of the wall, I get called. 

I’m five hours away from the mothership. We do things a bit different because the university doesn’t pay for every bell, whistle, or need out here. 

The faculty have to pay for things out of their own budget that’s generated through grants and a smallish stipend for discretionary use. If it ain’t in a grant, you have to find another way to pay for it. 

One of my senior faculty killed some keys on her very old, ergonomic, split keyboard. It was old, used up, and needed to be replaced. It’s a non-inlaid 10-key keyboard that has an ergonomic mouse. Replacement for the keyboard with a new separate 10-key was $75. Add a new mouse, and it was $140. This of course meant they are going to save the $65 and just go with the keyboard and 10-key. 

Cool, I’m sure you’re aware, this means using two dongles because the maker can’t imagine allowing all of their devices to talk to one. 

I swapped out the keyboard, placed the new 10-key, added the new dongle, and went about my day. 

A week later, the professor comes to me that there’s a ghost in her office. The keyboard just randomly types or deletes characters, cursor walks up the screen, just random shit, even happened when she was on a remote connection, but....,BUT...., can never be duplicated when I was in the room. Other people have seen it. At least three. But not me. 

This professor, jeebus love her, is high maintenance at times. I love dealing with her, because I tell her what we need to do, and she does it, even if she doesn’t like it. So of course I overlook her frantic cries for help and go when she calls. I have the utmost respect for her. She’s at the top level of her field, but trusts the least educated person in the room when he tells her something, “because that’s your thing”. 

Finally, she couldn’t take it anymore. Random shit when I wasn’t there (remember two sites). She recorded it with her phone, sent me the recording, and went to lunch. 

I happened to be coming onsite when she sent the recording. We met in the parking lot, and I could tell that she was upset by the look in her eyes. I promised I’d go find the issue, or I’d replace all the equipment on her desk. 

I went in, she’s still logged on (locked offices, so it’s ok), I get to work. Watch her video...holy shit, I can duplicate it!!! I stand up to check it, and the issue stops. I sit back down, as soon as I touch the keyboard, it starts again. I stand, it stops. I sit it starts. I stand, it keeps going. 

She’s got an adjustable tabletop standing desk. She uses it religiously. EXCEPT when other people are in the room because she’s taller than 100% of our staff, so she sits to be on eye level with them. 

I go to my office four doors away to grab my tool kit since I’m convinced it’s stuck caps. 

Then I see it. Her old keyboard. It’s on my desk with an inventory notebook laying on top of it. 

I moved the notebook, flipped the keyboard over, pulled the batteries, and left the carcass laying. 

Went back to her office and the ghost was gone. 

From wall to wall our offices are 48’. Her computer is on the southwestern wall, my desk is on the northeastern wall. Her old keyboard was two feet in. 

Two dongles. 

When she stood, her body blocked the signal from the old keyboard 40’ away. When she sat, it let the signal in. When I’m in the room, she never sits because we’re almost the same height, and she steps aside and lets me drive when there’s an issue.

There was a ghost!!!

It was me, and my inventory notebook, laying on her old keyboard all along. 

TLDR: I replaced a keyboard without completely getting rid of the old one and caused a user problems.",talesfromtechsupport,840,1614227813

Customer: Oh can't you remote on and do that for me I am in the middle of something?

Today, Geoff hit a new low.

We use a custom proprietary software at work, and we all have production and sandbox links on our desktops, but most people never use the sandbox environment. When you open the sandbox, it's very evident, because you get a pop-up warning you that you're not in production.

Not an hour ago, I hear Geoff ranting at his desk because ""I got a weird pop-up telling me that I'm in sandbox, but I clicked the same link I always do, so something is screwed up here."" I walk over, and as I'm approaching his desk, I assure him that he probably just accidentally clicked the wrong shortcut; it happens. He responds with ""No, but I clicked the same link in the same place on my computer that I always do!"" I look at the open software, and it clearly says he's in the sandbox environment, so I have him close it and show me the shortcut he opened. Again, he insists that ""It's in the same place I always click to open \[our software\]!""

I point to the shortcut he indicates, and ask ""What does that shortcut say?""

""Um...it says 'sandbox.'""

""Okay.....so you DID click the wrong shortcut.""

meanttobee3381,Submission is subpar,"Greetings. I've read many tales describing various boss situations. Some good, some bad. This is one of my tales.

I once worked for a local nerd shop who was trying to crack a government contract. One in particular came up.  The contact would have been well above what we were capable of providing, but none the less the CEO wanted to make a submission in the service tender process. 

I was given the job of writing it. They had never won a govt contract and wanted a fresh set of eyes for this one. My previous life in a different IT world would be useful.

Now, writing had never been my forte. Still isn't. (Sorry about that!) 

Our little nerd shop did standard IT consulting. Our typical clients were businesses with 1-10 terminals. Had some larger, but no significant size. Along came the tender process for whole of government IT services: hardware, virtualisation, data centres, internet security, device security, email, VPN, VoIP helpdesk, etc etc. Many multi million dollar, active-active services to be run.  They wanted to be tech supplier/support that rivaled our countries largest telco.

I didn't know much about some of the services we were trying to sell - we were literally reselling big-IT products. I arrange for some one on one with the vendors so I could understand. Yup, in previous life I'd done similar things. Never to this scale, but I understood. I quickly came to the conclusion that me writing the submission was a bad idea. Plus, as stated, I'm no word smith.

I decide that I'd actually try get the big companies to write their end themselves.  They are the subject matter experts and they wanted the government contracts too. So I ask haychpee, etc to write their bits and I'll just marry them together. Slowly they trickle in, and I cut and paste into the rough template I made on how I think the submission should flow. Many weeks and one very larger document later I think i am finished. As I hand the document to my boss/ceo he informs me of the pressure to get a contract as they've never won a govt contact before.

Life for me returned back to my hell desk roll. As time passed we find we didn't win and the boss decides to debrief me. Turns out he wasn't happy with the quality of my work. I clearly didn't understand the products as my description of their functions and inner workings were way off and I was poor with my grammar.  He spent several days rewriting the submission and he was not impressed.  He didn't mince his words either.  He blamed me for not winning the contact, and blamed me for not having enough time to rewrite it.   I didn't have the heart to tell him that the technical aspects were written by the engineers and sales teams of the actual vendors. If he rewrote the work of specialists, it's no wonder they didn't win many contacts.

So there you have it, a different twist: trying to win a contract to become tech support.",talesfromtechsupport,624,1614089349
andranox,"10 seconds for US$10,000","First time posting to this sub and Reddit so here goes:-

This story happened when I first joined my current company, and while I was not the one that actually had to deal with the problem, I was by-standing and heard the juicy parts from my mentor himself.

Exactly 2 days before a major festive celebration, we get a call from $user who is panicking because one of his equipment failed and production had been come to a screeching halt. Now, I work in a company that services critical process equipment in a country with a distinct west half and east half, separated by the sea (important as we are based in the western half). The Client was a major refining plant for the petroleum industry.

As we normally do, we go through the usual troubleshooting steps - did you this turn on, is this connection active,  yadaa yadaa but the only only answer coming from $user was ""yes yes yes"" with nothing seemingly wrong. This went on for about half an hour when suddenly our boss comes in. The Client's  Head of Production ($head) had just called him and was apparently livid. It turns out the machine had stopped working for more than an hour, and the production was severely interrupted until the problem got fixed.

Now everyone was in panic, as every hour the production was interrupted, the Client was losing money in the tens of thousands (US$) and the Client had the right to sue us for any damages that occur as a result of equipment downtime. $head was not happy that the their internal team was not able to fix problem, and $user was not making any headway in fixing the problem via phone.

To resolve the issue, $head demanded that support be performed immediately onsite. Coming back to my earlier points - 1. It's the festive season 2. they are across the sea, traveling was a bit of a problem but $head said money was not an issue and they would pay anything for immediate onsite support.

Cue $M my mentor who was handed the unsavory task of handling the emergency. Immediately he grabbed his tools, and sped off to the airport to grab the next available flight. At the same time, his wife had to pack some clothes for him from home and rushed to pass it to him at the airport. Due to the festive season, $M didn't have choices for flights so in the end he had to take a US$1000 business class flight (normally flights to where the Client is located costs \~US$80, we're a developing country, so yeah).

Upon arriving, $M was whisked from the airport with a driver, sent immediately to the refinery and granted immediate security clearance to enter plant (anyone working in petroleum would know how big a deal this is). By this time, a good 6 hours or so had passed since we received the call and well into the night. Greeting him in front of the equipment was $head, $user and various other senior managements personnel all anxious to see what the problem is.

$M is a guy with no chill, and he was also the one originally speaking to $user on the phone. He recounts this part so I'm paraphrasing him:-

&gt;$head: So what is it the problem?  
&gt;  
&gt;$M: Wait, let me take a look (starts to go through the normal troubleshooting checklists, but stops almost immediately)  
&gt;  
&gt;$M: $user are you sure you checked everything I asked you to?  
&gt;  
&gt;$user: Yes! Everything, word for word!  
&gt;  
&gt;$M: Are you absolutely sure?  
&gt;  
&gt;$user: Yes!  
&gt;  
&gt;$M: Do you remember what was the third thing i asked you check over the phone?  
&gt;  
&gt;$user: Why does it matter? just fix the g\*\*\*\*mn problem!  
&gt;  
&gt;$M: The first thing we normally check is to make sure the PC is turned on (points at the CPU LED indicator)  
&gt;  
&gt;$M: The second thing we check is to make sure the equipment is on (points to the machine LED),  
&gt;  
&gt;$M: The third thing (he brings his hand to a gas control valve, rotates it, and a loud hiss is heard as the gas line pressurizes, and the equipment beeps) is to make sure the gas is on.  
&gt;  
&gt;$user:....  
&gt;  
&gt;$head:....  
&gt;  
&gt;$everyone else in the room:....  
&gt;  
&gt;$M: I would like to go have dinner now

After more awkward silence, $head thanks $M for his effort and asks the driver to bring $M somewhere for dinner.

You'd think the story ends here, but there's more!

By the time $M finished his dinner, it was well past midnight so he checked himself into a hotel for the night. The next day he went back to the airport and found out that all flights were completely sold out for the next 4 days due to the festive traveling. He called my boss to inform him that he was basically stranded, and my boss just coolly said to him ""Well $M, consider this as having a free holiday paid by the Client""

So $M checks into the most luxurious hotel in the area, spends the next 4 days basically on vacation before coming back to work.

In total we billed the client for \~US$10,000 for the flights, hotel, emergency arrangements, allowances etc. all for 10 seconds to turn check LEDs and turn a valve. This is not including the losses from halting the production. It's still one of our most memorable stories that we recount to new hires or clients in our industry. Sometimes we wonder what happened to $user but he was transferred out if his role not too long after this incident.

**TLDR : Client pays US$10,000 for a super easy job that could be done themselves, and my mentor gets a free holiday**

Rusty99Arabian,The Why I'm Not Allowed On (or Under) Tables story,"Or, unusual problems with Polycoms.

I worked in IT at a number of universities, where pay is bad and clients have unusually weird problems. On our tiny team, each person had a speciality, and my IT strength lay in the fact that I was short and light, the only person able to fit into the small, awkward places that cables and misplaced equipment can fall into. I was also the most junior, so that meant anything having to do with video conferences fell to me, because video conferences are absolute torturous hell.

On this particular occasion my height was working against me. I had set up all of the video conference equipment in our newly outfitted meeting room, which had just been given a *very* expensive table at the whim of some administrator as well as a fancy new television stand. Everything was plugged in, but I was facing a stupid problem: the TV was off, and in the installation of the fancy new everything, someone had lost the remote.

The TV had a manual button on the \*top\* of the screen, which was now about 8ft off the ground. I couldn't reach it, and all of the conference chairs were on wheels, so that made them the last resort for standing on. The only good surface to stand on is the new table. So, I climbed up on it.

And that would have been \*absolutely fine\*, as I told my boss later, because I'm light and know my limits, except that right then one of our too-helpful student workers came in to see if they could help. They saw me get up on the table and decided that they should \*also\* get up on the table in case that made things better.

We found out the hard way that this fancy table's legs were all in the middle, rather than the corners. The inevitable happens--it tipped, and I, next to the fancy new TV stand, started falling directly towards the technology. The only thing that filled my mind was that I could not, could not damage the technology.

I'm afraid to disappoint for comedy standards, that neither the TV nor table were broken. Instead, I wrenched my shoulder bad enough to need physical therapy after I did this spectacular midair twist, throwing myself into the wall instead of marring any of the technology. Because I was in IT, and we never hurt our machines.

My boss, a great guy, was not pleased. Also not pleased when I marked down on the injury sheet that this was done in the normal line of duty because, as I pointed out, we had to stand on tables all the time -- we didn't actually have any equipment thanks to the old, terrible boss. He bought us a ladder and made me promise not to climb any more tables. Which I tried not to, whenever reasonably possible.

\---

Some background knowledge about Polycoms. Before Skype existed, and then waaaaay after, a few companies realized they could make and sell very expensive microphones and cameras that talked only to each other. It's a great business model, because if your school or company has Polycom and another school or company wants to talk to you, they also have to buy specifically a Polycom, because none of the other companies' machines would talk to each other, and even better, exactly the same model of machine you do. And, once you've shilled out for a Polycom, why would you throw it away and use something like Skype instead?

The important part is, Polycoms hate talking to each other. Each model's setup is \*extremely\* different, with some versions coming with screens that had dozens of buttons and options on them and some coming with controls that had three. In order to get two Polycoms to connect at all, you needed to input a meeting code and sometimes a password. Ideally, this code was just an IP address, but sometimes the codes were absolutely whackjob for no discernible reason. I was once unable to connect to a remote classroom because the room code included a @ sign, and the Polycom available to use didn't have a @ sign on the remote. Try explaining that to an impatient professor in front of a room of staring students.

But sometimes you would put in the same IP address into the same machine every single week and get completely different results every time. This was especially the case with the other incident: a weekly lecture series, beamed out to multiple other schools, with a packed lecture hall and important speakers.

Anyone who has done video conference work should be cringing. Multiple locations and high stakes? The connections never, ever worked correctly.

The other side would unmute themselves somehow. They would forget to turn their camera on. Their TVs would break. I eventually had the personal cells of IT support at both other schools on speed dial--nice people, luckily.

The professor who brought in the lecturers for the lecture series and I became friends, because she actually showed up for pre-lecture video testing on time each week, even though the lecturers never, ever did. She told me about unruly students and I told her about the table incident.

Finally, the last week of the lecture series came, and it was a big one. The State Rep for Related Field was the guest speaker, and the room was \*packed\*. Of course, the video equipment was failing left and right, but me and the other schools IT techs were solving problems left and right, too. We were champions at this by now.

Until, with one minute left until the speech began, \*my\* side had a problem--someone had managed to unplug one of my carefully taped-down cables. The resulting power outage caused the central control unit to reset. This unit is what allowed the lecturer to transmit their powerpoint to the distance locations as well as our own room's projector screen, and the projector screen itself. Resetting made the PPT stop sending, and also made the screen go up.

This projector screen was a serious unit, about 30' wide and 15' tall. It takes time to go up and down, time that no amount of IT magic can speed up.

It was a tense situation, in other words. I got the power restored and the PPT streaming again in record time, and told the projector, having completed its laborious trip up, to make the laborious trip down. Meanwhile, I'm determined to not have this problem happen again. So that means I need to add some more tape to the cable, which runs under the awkwardly large table on the lecture stage. What's the table even for? It holds water bottles and the professor's bags and--honestly, someone probably just put a table on the stage once and never took it away.

My professor friend even made a joke about me being careful around the table: ""Don't hurt yourself!"" Yeah, yeah. It's not an unrealistic concern. I think every tech has hit their head at least once in a rushed job.

I secured the cable, and in the most slow, exaggeratedly-safe method ever used, extracted myself from under the table.

I had forgotten about the fucking projector screen.

It hit me in the back of the head as it finished coming down, and this thing is \*huge\*, it weighs a ton for something that's basically a big sheet and a weight rod. It hit me, I ricochetted forward and smacked face-first into the table, and screamed ""SHIT!!!!!"" in front of the three collective audiences.

The professor helped me off stage and assured the State Rep, ""Sorry, she's not allowed near tables anymore.""",talesfromtechsupport,1837,1612366351
dickcheney600,"An oversight so big, it hertz","I volunteered at a thrift store while I was in college, and we of course got our fair share of electronic devices in various functional states. We sometimes did simple repairs (e.g. a belt, or fuse) but I usually ended up just testing stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see this weird ""chair speaker"" thing, not sure if it's meant for gaming or what. It can either take 6 D batteries, or you can also plug it in if you prefer, as evidenced by the barrel jack that says ""AC IN"". Well, we don't keep all those AC adapters for nothing. A bit of a problem, though. The voltage isn't listed. The good news is that polarity isn't a problem with AC, and any needed regulation would have to be inside the device, so an exact voltage match is not important. 

&amp;#x200B;

Only other problem is, how much current are we talking about? Maybe an amp or so, seeing how it uses D batteries? That just leaves the voltage. I can tell by the battery compartment that all 6 batteries are in series. Alkaline and ""heavy duty"" batteries are 1.5 volts, and rechargeable NiCd/NiMh batteries are around 1.2 volts. Simple math yields 9 volts.  A diode drop means that a 9 volt AC transformer would yield about 8.3 volts, but in practice, a lightly loaded transformer will have a somewhat higher voltage output than is listed: the rating is approximately what it will be under full load, but may be up to 20% higher. Again, devices that need flat, stable voltages either need a regulated DC adapter, or an internal regulator. This one clearly says ""**AC IN**"" not ""DC""

&amp;#x200B;

Rummage, rummage, rummage. Test some other stuff, price this, toss that, blah blah blah. I come across exactly what I'm looking for: 9VAC, 1.5 Amps, and a plug that fits! Hurray! 

&amp;#x200B;

I find an aux cord and plug my tape player into the thing. I plug in the AC adapter into the speaker chair, press play and turn on the switch. Nothing but a loud 60 Hz hum. What could be POP POP FIZZ FIZZ Oh! What a bad sound that is! Pull the plug. 

&amp;#x200B;

It definitely smells like a capacitor let loose. Well, if it's just one, maybe we could fix it, especially if it's a common, cheap value we can easily get, or I already have in my hobby collection. Well, unfortunately, given the lack of a bridge rectifier anywhere in the circuit, it looks like it was actually supposed to take **DC** at 9V through that jack. It was labeled, **by the manufacturer**, as **AC** when it was supposed to take **DC.** What the farad were they thinking? Did the engineers hold the lead solder in their mouth when they were designing this thing? Needless to say, it got scrapped.",talesfromtechsupport,607,1612320346
Rusty99Arabian,The Explosive Gas story,"Or, the one time I had a Priority 1 (multiple lives threatened) support ticket.  


I worked in IT at a number of universities, where pay is bad and clients have unusually weird problems. One day a ticket came in at 4 PM on a Friday, stating that the user's monitor wasn't working. It was from our furthest building, which due to bus route inefficiencies, would be a 3 mile round trip walk. And, our boss had just come in and said that we could head off a little early if we had everything done.  


But since I was a go-getter who hated to have one last task looming on the list over the weekend, I decided to take one for the team and do it.  


When I made the long walk over and up to the third floor science wing, I found the scientists in more of a state than usual. There was yelling, common because everyone's least favorite professor worked over there, but also running, which was much more unusual. (We in IT tried to avoid this area as much as possible, because of the professor but also because there was Gateway running Win95 attached to scientific equipment machines that couldn't be updated or connected to the internet, and sometimes people would ask us to update it, and we would have to hide.)  


This isn't involve that computer, luckily. Instead, the faulty monitor in question was attached to a computer hooked up to a newer science machine. The machine spun gasses in a centrifuge, and could *only* be turned on and off via software on the nearby computer. Great design. They had just started the test when the monitor went out, which meant they could not stop the test--and as they explained, if these gasses spun for over 6 hours, they would explode.  


Amazingly, the problem didn't involve cables--the monitor had genuinely died. I switched in a monitor from across the room, and was hailed as a hero. Then I explained to everyone in the room that the next time the computer attached to their explosive machine had a problem, they should really include ""explosive"" in the ticket request to ensure prompt attention.",talesfromtechsupport,2063,1612286840

So today my colleague gets a call from a lady at one of these sites who is having an issue with a local app we have next to no knowledge about. My colleague steps her through using snipping tool so she can email through the error and she seemed very happy she'd learned something new. Next minute the email comes through with a picture attached. It was a photo of the snipping tool window taken from her mobile phone.

She wins second place after the lady who once sent us a ""screen shot"" by somehow placing the monitor on the photocopier, printing a copy then scanning the paper to email.

bradley547,"""WHY DID YOU TELL HIM THAT?!""","From my days as a cash register repair guy.

Drove out to repair a cash register at a mini-mart in a popular beach town. They had a service contract and two cash registers so I didn't expect any drama.

One of their registers had ""just stopped working"" in the middle of a shift.

The drive out there takes about an hour but is gorgeous so I'm in a good mood when I get on site.

I do the normal troubleshooting and find that the lights are on but nobody's home. Machine has power but isn't accepting any user input.So while I am troubleshooting the two cashiers are trading off on the one working register and the owners (a husband and wife couple) are deflecting Karens.I pop the cover off and immediately see the problem, In fact I may have even uttered the immortal ""well THERES yer problem...""

I turn to the owner and say ""Looks like someone spilled into the keyboard. Looks like Coffee with cream and sugar.""

Immediately I hear ""WHY DID YOU TELL HIM THAT?!""

My head snaps to my left and I see cashier number 1 with her hand over her mouth and eyes wide as saucers. She then ran out of the shop and cashier 2 and the owners burst into laughter. ""OK....""

Turns out that Cashier 2 drinks his coffee black like all truly good people. The owners drink tea, but I'm open to alternative lifestyles. ONLY cashier 1 drinks coffee with cream and sugar.

Apparently she had done the deed but rather than fess up she was hoping the problem would either go away on its own or not be traceable to her.

My detective skills had convicted her of the crime.

Fortunately the coffee never made it to the electronics and I quickly replaced the keyboard matrix and retuned the machine to service.

Felt kinda bad about having to charge them because spills were not covered under their contract.

As I was leaving I saw the owners escorting the most hangdog looking cashier back into the store. She was still there the next time I serviced the site so I suspect her only punishment was a healthy dose of embarrassment.

Alias_This_Is,"I know, I installed it.","I've worked in IT for almost 25 years and now am considered a global expert in my specialty. I’m one of the people who made sure that anything on the internet was permanent and had a hand in building a major cloud service.

In the early 2000’s I was already considered an expert and was asked by my employer to present about a product at a bank who had just purchased it. I was part of a team with two other guys, each of us was going to give a technical presentation to the IT department. The first guy had been talking for about five minutes when someone entered the room and things started going downhill. He was heckling us.

“Well, when I was at &lt;insert major retailer&gt;, we had problems with that and blah, blah, blah.”

The guy had the most annoying, nasal, snide voice, just dripping with “I’m going to blather on about how smart I am by putting you down.” GOD, I wanted to punch him, but even worse I had to do my presentation in front of him. Maybe he’d stop after the first guy was finished.

Oh no he didn’t.

The next guy got up, talking about a different but related product and its technical features, and he laid into him, “Well, &lt;insert major retailer&gt; had so much trouble with iSCSI that we had to blah, blah, blah.”

Oh wonderful.

What I \*didn’t\* notice was how the other people in the room were reacting to him. He was getting the side-eye, ESADMF looks, and blatant glares from all the IT guys there. In retrospect, why the manager there didn’t shut him up is still a mystery.

So when my turn came, I decided just to plow through things and endure him. I started talking about my product and sure enough, he HAD to say something.

“Well, at &lt;insert major retailer&gt; we had one of these and it gave us a LOT of trouble with authenticating into Windows domain servers,” This was before Active Directory came out, not relevant to the story but it gives the tech folks of an idea when.

I stood there and listened to him, just nodding along, I can field this one, no sweat.

“I know, I installed it.”

DEAD SILENCE.

“The OS was about 3.2 or 3.3, I think,” I went on, not realizing what had happened, “Now we’re on version 6 and, if I remember right, it was a Windows authentication issue and worked perfectly after a patch.”

Two seconds later it hit me. Oh CRAP! I just shut down the client! But I continued on with my presentation and he left shortly afterwards, before I finished.

All the IT guys came up and apologized, telling me he’d just come over from &lt;insert major retailer&gt; and couldn’t stop talking about how they did things and why it was better. One guy said he was an ass and they couldn’t stand him.

Outside the bank, everyone was laughing and congratulating me for shutting him down, saying he’d stepped in it and stepped in it GOOD. We were almost at lunch when we met the sales guy, who had been on the phone, and the first thing he asked was, “Who’s Joe (not my name)?”

“Me,” I replied, not certain how this was going to go but he shook my hand.

“That was freaking BRILLIANT! I was so mad at that jerk and when you shut him down I jumped up and started punching at the phone yelling, YES! YES! YES! Take THAT arsehole!”

I’ve told that story over and over since, it never gets old and NEVER has happened again. I honestly don’t want it to, I’m a professional that takes great pride in my work and he was the total opposite of one.

ISlothyCat,Customer wastes HUGE amount of $ for a 1 minute fix.,"I am stunned right now! In order to make sure this stays anonymous, I'm going to be as vague as possible while still getting the point across...

I work for a company that manufactures things. We make big complicated things that require trained professionals to service, in addition to simpler things that any literate human with opposable thumbs (or a reasonably good mechanical facsimile) can handle.

So I get a call from one of our very experienced technicians. They've been dispatched to change a setting on one of the simpler devices we make. Literally, that's it. This company paid nearly $2000USD (it cost extra for getting it done right away - this customer wanted this very unimportant setting changed immediately!) for this service that was about as difficult to do as changing the channel on a TV when you've lost the remote and you gotta do it using the hidden buttons - but these buttons weren't even hidden! Service calls are billed at a minimum of 4 hours, plus driving time. This setting takes 1 minute maximum to change - if you're doing it for the first time. Maybe 10 seconds if you're experienced.

Then, it turns out the tech didn't actually know how to do it! Now I know they hardly ever work on these units since they are so simple, but the units all have these handy little things called 'user manuals' (trying to make air quotes here) online, for just any old person to use to look shit up. 

So yeah, I'm just a bit shocked right now at the capricious waste of money being spent by a company whose sole purpose for existing is to manage money for their clients while also being stunned by the fact that little ol' me needed to be called to figure out how to do it.",talesfromtechsupport,784,1605581454
Danjcb,Turning one man’s week into another man’s hour and a half.,"Obligatory happened a couple of years ago, not in IT but into computers, and this is bit of a long one.

So, I started a new job, having just left one I’d spent automating as much as I could and moved into a team with some great guys and a really SupportiveManager (SM). My colleagues (mostly) knew their stuff, were all up for automating things and making things easier and were helpful in teaching me stuff I didn’t know.

I say mostly, because I was taking over from someone I will refer to as FashionBoy (FB). FB wasn’t too bad to begin with, a little odd in his own way but just kinda plodded along with the job. He taught me the basics and I got to work. This is when the warnings started to come in, people telling me how awkward he was and to be careful.

He was using basic macros that other people had written in Excel, and I started digging into them a bit and learning how they worked. Digging through the VBA scripts I started trying to clean up a lot of the code, trying to speed it up a little bit more than anything while still doing the new job. When recording macros in Excel there tends to be a lot of scrolling that goes on that can just be deleted – so it was just getting rid of a lot of this really alongside some other inefficiencies I was tidying.

All in all – I probably cut it down to about 2/3s of the time, maybe half (they were really messy).

Now he’d only got about 4 macros or so, but I could see there was a lot more he’d previously been doing himself that could be cut down to a macro. A lot of exporting data from the system – cutting and pasting columns, sorting data, deleting things etc. When I could just run a macro to sort it all, delete anything I didn’t need, copy it, and then all I had to do was paste it into the right place. I started recording some macros of my own and tweaking them afterwards to make them more efficient.

It was at this point FB asked me what I was doing (VBA script clearly not being part of the job description). After a little hesitancy, I figured what the hell – he was using macros anyway, so who cared? I explained what I was doing and then “The Change” began.

Exactly what people had warned me about was revealed. He absolutely flipped, saying I didn’t know what I was doing, that I was messing with company processes and was going to break them, that he’d put these macros together for me (he hadn’t put them together, and certainly not for me) and I was ruining them.

In comes SM to save the day – pulls FB into a meeting room and basically tells him where to get off, didn’t even need to ask my side of the story. FB runs out crying, SM comes over to me and tells me to carry on – with the biggest grin on his face. He knew exactly what he was dealing with.
Super weird day – but FB kinda stayed away from me after that, only talking to me when he really needed to. What a blessing!

After a little while I found I’d be using these macros multiple times throughout the week – but for different tasks. I spoke to IT to switch a couple of reports around so I could use the same macro for multiple different reports, and it ended up saving me tonnes of time. So I’d ask for more work – and ended up taking more of FB’s stuff off him. Again, more things I’d automate with macros.

After this – SM found another job elsewhere, and before he left said “This team is far too big for the work there is, do what you can with it and keep your head down”. Oh and how right he was!

I ended up reporting to his OldBoss (OB) for a bit, then moved to a NewManager (NM) within the team. They just left me to do my thing, and had no complaints – as long as everything was getting done.

I ended up with about 10 macros that would do basically a day’s work in 15 mins. Every. Single. Day. Where FB was taking hours, my week was lasting all of about an hour and a half, split across the week. The frustrating thing was that he had the tools – he was even using them, but still didn’t do more with them.

I’d go to OB and NM but neither had the enthusiasm SM ever had to listen to me when I was trying to get more work from them. “Oh you’ve got enough to do, you’ve taken all of FB’s work after all!” and despite my protests, they wouldn’t give me more work (which was just insane). I asked other people if I could help them, but they got protective of what (seemingly little) work they had and wouldn’t accept help.

Unsurprisingly once the management changed, things started to go downhill. I asked if I could work at home (unofficially so that I could do other stuff) but the answer was a firm no. I was just bored – it was like prison - I’d automated myself out of a job and the management didn’t even care. So, I just started seeing how far I could push it.

I’d set myself small challenges like “Can I go for a day without saying a word to anyone?” (this day included multiple meetings with people and data I had to run through – I still succeeded).

As much as I enjoyed my free time – I needed things to do. So, I used the time to get another job, I wrote up the details of what I did step by step, handed in my notice, distributed it out to the team, and left for something new (and a five figure pay rise).

MrLumie,"Fix those e-mails, ASAP!","So  this happened on a web project we had for a government agency (because I  love working with them). Development had been completed for a good one  and a half year, and we were in a rather uneventful supporting phase,  until an error ticket arrived from the customer:""Notification e-mail not arriving on form submission. Fix it ASAP!""

A  little context: The site we developed was for a government program that  business owners could apply for. This is what 'The Form' was for. Upon  submitting The Form, the application information would be stored in the  system, and a notification email would be sent out to a set of  predefined addresses. Except that the e-mails stopped arriving. Although  these notifications weren't all that important, since the data were  accessible through their admin portal anyway, the customer was  adamant that we resolve this issue as fast as possible, so I got to  work.

I've checked if the  addresses were correctly set. They were. Then tried it out on our test  server with a test address. The e-mail arrived without an issue. I've  ran a few more rounds, trying to find the source of the problem, but to  no avail. I've concluded that the answer might lurk among the mail  server logs, so I handed the ticket over to the server management to  check the mail server logs. Now, the application is hosted on the  customer's server. We have access to it, but are not directly  responsible for its architecture. This'll be important.

A  few days go by, no news about the email problems, I'm pretty much  preoccupied with other projects, kinda forgot about this ticket already.  That is, until the following conversation took place with the project  manager (PM):

PM: Oh, by the way, we know what was wrong with the notification emails on the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ project.  
Me: Oh, really? What happened?  
PM: Well, it turns out the mail server that was responsible for sending out the notification emails doesn't exist anymore.  
Me: Oh wow  
PM: Wait, it gets better  
Me: ... yea?  
PM: It was shut down in November.  
Me: But... it's... July.  
PM: I know.  
Me: The ticket arrived less than a week ago.  
PM: I know.  
Me: They... said it's urgent.  
PM: \*sigh\*... I know.

The problem was quickly resolved after that. I still wonder to this day, just how urgent the problem could've possible been if it took them 8 months to realize that not a single notification email is arriving, despite new entries popping up on the admin portal.",talesfromtechsupport,1125,1605493872

TheShire603,"""We can't access network drives without being connected to the VPN. Please fix this.""","I love IT.

So we got a ticket this morning about this company's bookkeeper not being able to access the shared drives on the network without connecting to the VPN. Having set up quite a few of these people from this company for working from home, I assumed the bookkeeper was off-site and trying to connect in. 

The email chain--

Me: Is the bookkeeper working from home or is she onsite? If she's working from home, she will need to be connected to the VPN any time she needs to access any network resources at the office. Unfortunately there is no way around that. Is she having trouble with the VPN?

Contact at Company: She's not working from home. She's in the office and working on the desktop PC in her office and still needs to connect to the VPN in order to access the shared drives.

Me: Does her desktop have a network cable plugged in or is she accessing the network wirelessly? It's possible she may be connecting to the wrong network.

Contact: She's not connected with a network cable. We have to use the wifi hotspot on her phone to connect her to the internet so she can VPN in to the office network to access the shared drives. I have a network cable we can try if you think that'll help?

Me: Yes, please plug in her computer with the network cable to the wall jack that should be located on the wall next to her desk. Let me know if that fixes it.

Contact: It worked! All we did was plug it in and it reconnected to the office network. Whatever you did remotely before we plugged it in worked!

Me: Glad to help. If I may ask, was her computer connected to the office network with a network cable before? Did it get unplugged somehow, or was it removed for some reason?

Contact: It was connected before she left, we took the network cable out of her office when she came back because she'd been working off a wireless network at home and we didn't want to confuse the server.

Me: Well I'm glad it's working now, have a great day!",talesfromtechsupport,2366,1595340648
EonThief,One Of The Good Ones,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to share a positive story, one that happened to me yesterday. 

I had a user call in because her direct access wasn't working, I'm unsure if other companies use this but to cover my bases it's a VPN that is basically always on from initial login. 

Well it's not that it wasn't working, but it just wasn't on her computer at all.

But anyways, she called in because she couldn't access network drives at home. She told me that she called in a few days prior and she was told after troubleshooting done then that she would need to go into an office for further troubleshooting. Usually when people call in under these circumstances they're usually frustrated and more than willing to share that frustration, not this lady though.

The call ended up lasting about an hour, during this time I went through all the troubleshooting at my disposal (making sure her computer was in the proper group in AD, making sure her group policies were up to date, running software cycles) and basically all the other troubleshooting we had listed for this type of issue. The whole time, she was incredibly patient and understanding, and she kept actively trying to initiate small talk (a rarity from the users we support). 

After getting a fresh perspective on the issue, we were able to get her taken care of and she was so appreciative for the help. That call, while close to the end of my shift, made whole day.

hiii_impakt,The hard drive in my 10+ year old Windows 7 PC is failing? That's unpossible!,"Tl;dr at the bottom. 

So to preface, I work at a large electronics and office supplies retailer that also provides tech services (let's call them paperclips). I sell electronics and tech services and perform said services. 

So this customer brought his computer in because it won't boot into windows. He assumed this was because he unplugged it while it was booting and his OS files got corrupted (partially true, but we'll get to that). He wanted us to reinstall windows (I think...tbh I'm not entirely sure what he expected us to do). We booked it in for diagnostics because we don't do anything unless we're sure what the issue is. 

We run some tests and lo and behold, his hard drive is failing. Just to be sure it's not a fluke we always run a second test. Failed again. So I call him to explain this to him and offer to replace it with an SSD, upgrade him to windows 10, and transfer his files (or he could buy a new computer because as stated in the title, this one is over 10 years old). He immediately gets pissed at me because he ""knows for a fact"" that his drive is ""perfectly healthy"" and that just his OS files are corrupted. He then proceeds to regurgitate to me what he probably read in the first article to pop up after googling his error code. I then explain to him that it's common for failing hard drives to be the reason for corrupt files but he's convinced I'm lying to him to take his money. 

After a bit of back and forth with him he decides he's going to come and pick up his PC. He shows up and we get into another argument because he wants a refund because we gave him a ""bogus diagnosis"" and ""didn't do our job properly"". He's convinced that there's no possible way his 10+ year old hard drive (that was over 90% full) is failing and he refuses to give us anymore money. Eventually my manager gets involved and gives him his refund just to get rid of him. 

He leaves and comes back later to buy the SSD I attempted to sell him earlier. I assume he's going to attempt to replace it himself. Something tells me he'll be back.

Moral of the story: I hate people. 

Tl;dr: guy brings in his computer thinking his OS files are corrupt and wants it fixed. We find out his HDD is dying but he doesn't believe us and argues his way to a refund, only to end up buying a new SSD anyway.

Me: I’m seeing a few devices connected is there one in particular that you’re having issues with?

KD: My computer won’t let me sign in. The keyboard won’t let me type in my username. And before you even think about telling me,  I’ve rebooted the computer like 10 times, changed the batteries, and nothing is working.

Me: hmm I would like to try a few other things if you don’t mind. Can you please reseat the USB dongle? It’s possible the keyboard is out of sync

KD: I don’t know what that is stop talking to me in your tech speak. Just send a tech to fix the internet.

Me: KD, Wireless keyboards don’t run on WiFi. There will usually be a small flash drive that connects to the computer.

This correction angers her even more and I can hear her mumble obscenities. Reseating the dongle doesn’t resolve the issue. So as a last Hail Mary I ask her to send me a picture of the keyboard when she does, I see the issue...

Delachruz,"Where Internet comes from, and why Wi-Fi is evil","Hello TFT, I recently, finally, finished my apprenticeship. To celebrate, let me share probably the weirdest thing that happened to me while trying to become a Techie.

Years ago, I was working for a school. Multiple buildings, a couple hundred students, few dozen teachers. besides me there were  always 2 other apprentices. For the most part, we were tasked with manning the phones and dealing with only ""basic"" stuff. To the point that officially, you were not allowed to plug or unplug anything unless one of the Bosses gave you the go ahead first. Which was fine for the most part, since I'm reasonably certain I solved 80% of my cases with a simple reboot.

One of my bigger projects was installing Wi-Fi, and ensuring that the entire main building had coverage. At first, everything was dandy, as people were enjoying finally being able to connect wirelessly. But after a few months, we started getting complaints.

""I want that thing gone."" That ""thing"" being Access Points. It was an old building, and most rooms were used for classes or offices for teachers. There was a limit where we could put them, since it had been decided putting them in the halls would make it more likely for students to vandalize them (Something that happened a lot). One of the Teachers had apparently ""read Online"" that the waves sent out by APs waere harmful. I remember that I had to try really hard not to laugh at the guy, because he called it ""Internet Energy"" at one point.

Not too bad, meant literally his office and his classroom didn't have any coverage. But then more complaints kept coming in, as more people were kindly informed about the harmful influence. It got progressively stupider too. Initially they said that APs would cause headaches, and eventually it escalated to them apparently causing cancer (No, really. I had people yell at me for that.).

Apprentices were not allowed to talk back in any way. Even if the people we spoke to, or more commonly, the people yelling at us were provably wrong. So every time another complaint came up, I had to call down into our department, get the Boss on the line, confirm that I had to remove the AP, and then do just that. He didn't really want to argue this with any of the teachers either. The fact that we caved immediately and just removed the APs seemed to just reaffirm the people complaining that they were correct.

So little by little, we had to remove around 80% of the previously placed APs. The only two places that had coverage in the end were our Department, and the Directors Office (Quote: ""Even if they do, I ain't afraid of no cancer.""). Which, hilariously, meant that both of these places would be insanely crowded during breaks. I frequently had to muscle my way through two dozen teenagers to get my coffee back to my station.

About 6 months later, one of the older teachers retired and was replaced. When he wondered aloud in the break room why only two places in the building had coverage, I told him the answer. ""That's dumb."" he said. ""I've worked in IT before, who would believe that? Could you put a new AP up on my floor please?"".

And so we did, and in the same week, we started getting requests to put the others back too.",talesfromtechsupport,1549,1591966044

Prokupine,"What was that, what did you just do???","First time posting here.

In my junior year at college (3 years ago) I had to complete an unpaid internship for a non-profit as a ""course credit"" in order to complete my major. It was only 10 hours a week and was assigned quasi-randomly. 

I was ecstatic to find out that I was working for a non-profit that needed help in streamlining their google sheets experience. One of the few things I was very comfortable with. 

On my first day I get the lay of the office and this sweet older administrative assistant begins sharing the google drive folders with me. She was a retired teacher who volunteered full time at this organization that mentors students. 

Poking through the spreadsheets I discovered they had 40+ sheets they share with local schools and had tons of student data (none of it was sensitive). Over the course of the semester I helped automatically scrape every single sheet and import it into a master sheet while calculating specific data for each month that this older volunteer had to do manually every week. However, what I remember the most was what I showed her that first day; on accident. 

I opened up the largest spreadsheet they had, which was about 10,000 rows. It was also their most viewed spreadsheet around the small office. This sweet old volunteer is over my shoulder watching me as I bounce around the sheet.

As I scroll threw all this data, I instinctively click **View-&gt;Freeze-&gt;1 Row**, so I know what I am looking at as I scroll down. 

She stops me and says: ""What was that, what did you just do???"" 

**$Me**: ""I just froze the top row.""

**$Her**: ""I need you to show me how you did that.""

She then gestured me to follow her into her office and she booted up her Chromebook. In that moment I saw the most clever and adorable solution to this age old problem.

This 65yr old women had **taped a thin strip of notebook paper with each column header written out in pencil along the top bezel of her laptop.** 

She mentioned how often she used that spreadsheet and she was always getting lost when she scrolled through it.

She looked at me and said: ""Well don't I look silly"" and proceeded to tear that thin strip of notebook paper off of her laptop. I just smiled while I watched her open up every other google sheet she used to freeze the top row.",talesfromtechsupport,2095,1591802815

I run small IT company, our customers are generally happy with our services. If there is some problem, we try to fix it as soon as possible. I think, happy customer is great, because he can bring us more clients.

One of our services is web hosting. We run few servers for our clients without any problems. There is always at least one client of every IT company, who is just unhappy with everything. This client has just hosting with us. Few weeks ago was his hosting due to renew, so I send him the invoice over email and signed copy by mail (law in my country, you must have signed original). After few days his invoice by mail came back as undeliverable, so I did try to call him few times. He never answered any of my phone calls, never called back or answered to my emails.

Due day came and no answer or no payment, so I waited few more days and after that I canceled his services. I made backup of his account, as I do everytime just to be sure. His services was turned off.

Next day I get call from customer complaining, his webpage is not accessible and he is losing customers. I asked him his company name and sure, it was owner of that company. He demanded to bring his web page online at that moment. He was very angry.

So I said very calmly: ""Ok, it is not a problem, all you have to do is to give me your postal address and I send you the invoice by mail. There should be copy of your invoice in your email, you can pay that. After payment received, your services will be renewed.""

But, the main point of this story is to talk about the CEO, an old fart if ever there was one, who read somewhere that computers would allow you ""one button access to your data."" (Thanks marketing a-holes.)

So, he demanded that his computer - he'd never used one - be configured so that he simply had to push one button on the keyboard and whatever he requested would appear. I asked him what he wanted to appear and he said ""Whatever I need.""

In other words, he insisted the network be able to read his mind after pushing the ""one button"" which would then print out what he needed. I explained that our network wasn't clairvoyent to which he said ""I approved the purchase of this equipment because I was told it would allow one-button access to the information I need.""

My solution, which, I'm very sorry to say worked, was to go to Radio Shack and buy a Sonalert buzzer which I hardwired to his keyboard. Any key he pressed would cause the Sonalert to sound at his admin assistant's desk who would, by virtue of her knowing everything that he needed and having the patience of a saint, then print his report and bring it in to him.",talesfromtechsupport,957,1591645079
branmac2,What a Waste of the Environment,"Here's a guy who was *way* ahead of his time in that he was concerned about the environment and wasting paper. This happened in 1998. I was the chief IT guy for the organization.

A VP (nice guy, older, and not too tech-savvy) at a branch office came to our headquarters for a meeting and dragged a large box of papers into the boardroom. The box easily had the equivalent of 3-4 reams of paper in it.

He immediately started berating me for ""wasting all this paper"" and ""unnecessarily destroying trees."" Asking him to explain himself he showed me all the papers in the box which were nothing but emails.

It turns out he never used his computer. He told his admin assistant to print his emails so he could read them. Thousands of them over the course of a year. He didn't seem to get the point why he should just **read them himself** and not bother printing them.",talesfromtechsupport,1085,1591617830

tl;dr- I'm a contractor at Large Client(LC). I'm helping them remediate audit findings in a difficult environment. I recently got my hands on the audit. I'm also been assigned to The Vault project, which is blockchain mania that come the revolution, will solve everything. 
  

I think that the Vault is vaporware. I'm wondering how many people know. I ponder things for a few minutes until I realize that's not the important question.   
  
The real question is ""what's it to me?""  
  
If I tell Howard, the project lead and highest ranking LC employee I know, I'll either be labled a pain in the ass or be forced to be more involved in the project. Lose/lose.  
  


From my point of view, the Vault actually isn't relevant. It's not operational, so it can't have audit findings. Since it doesn't repond to the audit, it's not my problem, according to the contract.  
  

  
Speaking of contracts, I'd like to have some _proof_ that I did things. We're going to need findings closed.   
  
And I'm going to keep my mouth shut. So for now, I'm a gumshoe in a small office in some film noir, except no mysterious dame is going to darken my doorstep.   
  
I'm going to find issues and close them. 
  
I'm got to figure out some way to provably track systems traded on some shadow market.  
  
And I have a login to the Slack channel where it happens.  
  
The Slack seems to have a handful of closed channels. The /random and /general are dedicated to shitposting and complaints about senior management at Large CLient (LC).  
  
I leave it open. I start reading the audit report. It's not like any professional audit report I've ever read. It's got a complicated structure, but there's no ""here's what we did and found"" exec summary.    
  
Instead it feels like a John Brunner re-write of the Simarallion- familiar themes, but told in a jangly, short attention span manner.  
  
And nobody cares about the characters to remember their names.  
  
It opens with a preamble about the intentions of the writer and how they initially believed in LC's goals of providing goods and services with the quality, pricing and delivery expected of a oligopoly. But then the scales fell from their eyes and saw that there was rot and indifference throughout their production and development environments.  
  
Then there were findings. Lots and lots of findings. Some make sense, others are rants labeled as findings.  
  
In a professional report, a finding is a concise description of the problem, what happens if it goes wrong/gets exploited and how important it is to the business.  
  
Our writer also includes backstory.   
  
As an example:  
  
**Finding 252**: Incorrect and non-compliant Time Servers.  
  
**Description** LC's Operations Lead has picked wrong time servers. They have picked time servers in the EU instead of North America.   
  
**Risk** HIGH. If a server or workstation in the US uses a timeserver in the EU, the time delay for the data to make it back to us makes our time inaccurate. Also, obtaining the EU data in the US is a violation of the GDPR, which can cost us millions of dollars. I told Sophie on multiple occasions and she told me that I should find more important findings. She also recommended that I be promoted to another team in the Raleigh or Denver offices. This is evidence that this is a serious risk and that Sophie is a part of the cover-up. 

And there are hundreds of these findings. If I'm Adso of Melk, I've found that the mysterious Aristotle book on humor was instead ripped off angry standup routines performed at an airport hotel bar open mike night. 
  
Now I have a map. I can pick issues to close and actually ~~fix~~ cross items off a list. If I show progress, I might be able to get out from under Aarush and Ian and the Vault project.  
  
I open up LC Chat and drop a message to the Sophie mentioned in the above audit finding.  
  
me:""Sophie. I'm LawTechie and I'm trying to close out some audit findings. Do you have a minute?""  
  
No response.  
  
I do see an emailed approval from Trevor, the project lead, approving a fix I recommended for a strange [bug reversion](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/galiq9/bad_architecture_part_3_digging_deeper/). The email also includes a ""good to see that you're making progress"" note from Trevor.
  
Yay. I can scratch one audit finding off. Several hundred more to go.  
  
I realize I might be able to fix two problems today. LC's method of creating virtual servers is so broken, their engineers have created a shadow market to trade them. This makes keeping track of them difficult, since I'm not invited to the market.  
  
Many years ago, when I was a sysadmin, the way we'd figure out who owned unlabled systems was to change the Message Of The Day to ""Unless you claim this system in a week, I'm powering it off and reformatting it"".  
  
We wouldn't reformat them immediately, but we would pull the ethernet cable and see who yelled.   
  
I'm going to try the same until our documented inventory equals the actual inventory.  
  
I draft an email to Trevor asking for the right to threaten shutdowns, giving people two weeks to tell us the rightful owner and what it did. He responds with a ""let me get air-cover""  
  
Thanks, Bomber Command.  
  
I get a response from Sophie.  
  
Sophie:""What audit are you referring to and what is this about?""  
  
me:""It's the large one. You're referenced in finding 252, about time servers""  
  
Sophie:""...""  
Sophie:""...""   
Sophie:""...""   
  
  
Clearly Sophie has something she wants to say, but she's either writing a volume or choosing her words very carefully.  
  
Sophie:""That asshole""  
  
Carefully chosen.   
  
me:""I see. It seemed ridiculous, but I had to ask just in case you were a part of the great time server conspiracy""  
  
Sophie:""...""   
  
Sophie:""You're making a joke. Don't. Nobody finds this funny""  
  
me:""I don't understand. What firm did this audit so I never recommend them?""  
  
Sophie:""It was internal""  
  
me:""Internal audit wrote this?""  
  
Sophie:""No. Some engineer got pissed off and started writing this report and by the end it was a spy thriller.""  
  
me:""So they fired them?""  
  
Sophie:""No. They moved him to a new project. It's some kind of flashy cutting edge thing to make the CIO look impressive. I don't pay attention until it affects my budget""  
  
me:""Why'd they move him?""  
  
Sophie:""Well, I think management wasn't sure what else to do""  
  
me:""Makes sense- if you fire him, he's a whistleblower. Keep him on the team, it sows discord. Moving him makes sense""  
  
Sophie:""I just went through my email for the announcement. Ian got moved to a project called the Vault""  
  
me:...""

thumbtaks,I thought it needed lubrication,"So I am a Sys Admin at a medium sized manufacturing company. We have three people on our IT team and everyone is responsible for helpdesk, regardless of title. This is one of my favorite WTF moments.

We use some pretty heavy duty zebra thermal label printers for QR code labeling / scanning in our facility. Each product we make gets one so it can be tracked / accounted for in the manufacturing process. $User has the responsibility of printing a large number of these in preparation for production of said items.

In my experience, these printers are absolute beasts. Barring user-based ID10T errors, they almost never fail on their own. Usually a user mis-feeds the labels which in turn transfer adhesive to the rubber rollers which then become sticky and force the labels to catch on exit and spin around the roller rather than feeding out properly. This is further compounded by the fact that users like to use razor blades to remove the stuck labels, which destroys the rollers leading to further issues.

Cast includes...

**$Me** \- Yours Truly

**$User** \- A user who is also a CompSci student in their junior year at the time

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the story...

**$User** \- Hi helpdesk, I am having an issue with my label printer, I think it needs to be looked at.

**$Me** \- Sure thing $User, can you give me some information on what the problem is so that I can come prepared with any necessary parts I may need.

**$User** \- I'm not sure how to explain it. I think you will just have to come see what I'm talking about.

*I head on out to take a look. We have a few different buildings on the same block, but they are within walking distance. The IT offices are separate from the main production facility. This is why I like to get as specific with the issue as possible, so that I don't have to make multiple trips for parts. I grab a plethora of consumables to bring with me in case it's any of those. Spoiler alert: it wasn't.*

&amp;#x200B;

**$Me** \- Hi $User! I'm here to fix your label printer. Let's take a look, and can you show me exactly whats happening?

*$User starts talking, but as I open the side of the label printer to take a peek under the proverbial hood, all sound fades and my vision tunnels into the catastrophe before my eyes. Something is very, very wrong with this label printer. There is a thick light-colored gunk covering everything. It is everywhere. On gears, rollers, sensors, the thermal ribbon, the heat element, on wires, inside hinges, etc. We are talking Nickelodeon slime levels of covered. Slathered might be a more appropriate word.*

**$Me** \- What happened to this machine $User? What is all of this gunk?!

**$User** \- Well the labels were catching on the roller, so I figured it just needed some lubricant.

*I shake my head in disbelief. As I look around her desk, it hits me. I know what she has done. I am furious, but also thoroughly impressed. I did not know it was possible to mess up troubleshooting this bad. all I can do is try, and fail, to keep a straight face as I ask the next question.*

**$Me** \- $User, what did you use to lubricate it.

*$User holds up one economy sized bottle of Jergen's hand lotion. We are talking 55-gallon drum sized.*

**$User** \- I used a few pumps of this on some of the moving parts.

*A few my ass. This thing looks like it took a bath in a vat of Walgreen's finest moisturizer*

**$Me** \- $User, you ca... *(laughing intensifies)* you can't use han.... *(giggles and chuckles continue to escape)*. Look $User, I appreciate your efforts to, ermmmm, troubleshoot this problem yourself, but in the future please use the helpdesk. That's what we are here for. And to be clear, no fluids, gels, lotions, liquids, or anything of the sort should ever go into ANY electronics. *( I say this sternly but nicely. I legitimately cannot believe I am having this conversation, especially with a computer science student in their early twenties)*. I realize that you were trying to help, but you just created hours of work for my team.

**$User** \- I'm sorry, I thought the hand lotion would help.

**$Me** \- It didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone in the IT department loses it when I bring this printer back to our office and explain what happened. I spend the next three hours meticulously disassembling every moving part of this device and thoroughly cleaning it with goo-gone and alcohol wipes. To this day, this is a recurring joke... hand lotion in a printer. *SMH*",talesfromtechsupport,1247,1586962747

KitsuneExistISwear,We got the cops called on us after we refunded their money.,"Hello! Join me for the wild ride that is apparently my work life this week. I work for a computer repair and IT business mainly on the store front side of things but moving into the B2B services side of things. We also repair phones.

Our story begins with a father and teenage daughter entering our lowly little shop. Daughter has an iPhone that won’t turn on. They charge it and nothing happens. I check in the phone for diagnostics. Before opening the phone I notice that there’s a small crack in the bottom of the screen. Okay cool so the phones been dropped before. Can’t test much else cause of the aforementioned no power thing, but I do insert it into a specific tester for a specific logic board issue that affects power. It passes.

Open the phone, try new battery, doesn’t show any sign of life, try new batter AND new screen and BOOM phone powers on and charges and stays on and all kinds of good things. We make sure the battery charges to 100% and the battery tests healthy. Call the customer and inform them and they are upset and say that we must be lying as they bought that phone BRAND NEW earlier this year and the Daughter says she’s never dropped the phone. We tell them that yes this is what the phone needs to work and the phone has definitely been dropped as we observed a crack in the display during our pre repair inspection. They say they don’t believe us and will call back with their decision.

Enter Mother. Mother comes in and says that she wants to see the screen because the Daughter has never dropped her phone. She told her Father that and she would never lie. I show the broken screen. She says that is a hard to notice crack but it is a crack. Daughter confessed to dropping her phone during a very tearful phone call. Mother proceeds to argue with us for 15 minutes saying that they have had that phone repaired with us before right after they bought it. We have no record of that. Former manager of store was popular with customers but shady on the business practices. We are not surprised. Tell Mother we have no record. Mother is mad but moves on and agree to repair. States they are going out of town for the Holiday and won’t be back until the following weekend. K. It’s lies.

Finish repairs. Unit doesn’t hold charge as long as it should. Bossman notices this. Assumes I put in bad battery. Tells Father we need to order another battery. Father is displeased. Asks why we put in a used part. Explains that it was a new battery but new things can still be bad out of the box. Father does not believe this but agrees to wait for new battery. New battery comes in. Install. Still doesn’t hold charge. Test Logic board again. Still passes. Testing. More testing. Won’t hold charge, phone grows hot, still passes LB. Phone dies over night during testing. Won’t charge back up. Tries new charging port. It now charges while dead. Must need new charging port.

Call Father. Father is LIVID. States that we should have caught that before, do we even know what we’re doing, this would never happen with former manager. Bossman explains that it was charging but only while the battery has charge. Father doesn’t understand that batteries can die and must be recharged as he insists that means we installed used parts. Bossman explains that no that’s not what we do. Father demands that we take responsibility. Bossman declines. Bossman offers part for free if Father is so sure we are at fault. Father is irate and refuses the free thing. Demands to split it in half. Bossman agrees. 

Install charging port. Phone still does all the bad things. Test logic board and it still passes but Bossman grows suspicious. More testing. Bossman concludes that v expensive testing unit is lying and that the board component has failed. Bossman is not looking forward to that confrontation. I must fall on that particular sword tho because Bossman is called away to an on-site. Call customer. Goes to VM.

Calls again. Leaves another VM. Mother arrives. Is informed of situation. Offer Mother a refurbished replacement option for additional monies. Mother is offended. They have already spent so much. Inform Mother that other option that we remove our parts, reinstall their not working parts, refund their money, and they leave with the phone in the same condition it came in as. After a loud angry discussion with Father they agree to second option. Do as stated. Hand phone back in original state and refund their money. Mother leaves with receipt of refund. 

Get call from Father 10 minutes later asking when we’re gonna give back his money. Inform Father that the refund is complete in our side, Mother has the receipts, and it’s in the bank’s hands now. Father agrees. Then Father states that he has called the cops on us for “Theft by Deception” since we had his phone for a week and a half and we lied and tried to cover up our horrible mistake and lack of skills. He is also considering taking the business to small claims court for everything we put his family through. Father tells me to inform Bossman that that’s coming down the pipe and that we deserve it. 

Call Bossman. Bossman laughs and says let the cops show up. 

Cops show up next day. Yay.

TL;DR: initially simple repair becomes more complex and ends up drawn out over time. Customer is upset. Refund customer and give back phone. Customer calls cops on us. Cops actually show up.",talesfromtechsupport,940,1578096634
Bolinious,Why i escorted a printer to the 4600 foot level in a mine,"I was contracted to do IT years ago to a mine that goes nearly 9800 feed down. At the 4600 level there was a maintenance shop. They repair a bunch of different vehicles and equipment so it doesn't have the make the trek all the way to surface. They had an HP 5000 printer with two extra trays to have letter, legal and ledger paper at all times to be able to print work-orders, plans, blueprints, whatever they needed.

As you can expect, a mine is very dirty. Prints start getting very light and they would submit a ticket. I would ask for the printer to be brought to surface and it would take treks to surface in the back of a truck. 

I take all the covers off, remove the laser assembly, open it and proceed to clean the mirrors and prisms. Note: don't ever do that unless you know what you are doing. I would then seal it back up, re-assemble the printer, re-align the print on the page and send it back down.

This one time it gets back down and they complain that the printer will not print from the main tray, only from the two add-on trays. Instead of sending it up, since it worked perfectly when i had it, on surface just the day before. I get a visitor's induction and down the cage i go. I get to the printer and notice that there is a HUGE grinding noise when printing from the tray. I remove the side cover to see the frame and the gear set are completely mangled. As it turns out, the maintenance crew did not strap the printer in, they just put it on whatever else was in the back of the truck and drove down. On the way down, all the bumps made something bash into the printer.

So I get quotes for a replacement. Once it arrives i program it and tell my direct supervisor, the sysadmin. He gets me to get the visitors induction again for going underground and asks to meet me by the rear doors once i'm ready. I text him that i'm ready and head to the rear doors. Turns out IT at this mine had their own Pickup that they can bring underground. Like most Canadian mines, the majority of vehicles used underground are Land Cruisers, but the IT truck was a huge Ford F250. So i strap the printer in the back seat, hop into the passenger seat and down we go to the 4600 level to install the new printer.

When they saw us arrive they were so happy to see us. The SysAdmin gave them a strict warning that the printer was replaced because they did not take good care of their old one when sending it up and down and that next time it was coming out of their budget. Since then, the maintenance crew would borrow one of the other F250's to bring the printer to and from surface for any issues.

TLDR: Maintenance crew break their printer and the IT contractor and SysAdmin escort their replacement to the 4600 level in a mine.",talesfromtechsupport,2563,1573078107
saige45,The tale of almost catastrophic server death,"Back in the late 80's, I was a part of an internship program in school.  The systems administrator had to support a network with over 1000 devices on it and over 1500 users.  He came up with the idea of selecting a group of students to assist him.  We didn't get a wage but we did learn valuable skills in IT and this in turn has turned into an almost 30 year career for myself.

The following takes place in 1990.  A little background on the network setup.  We had recently upgraded from 3Com's 3+Open Network Operating System to Novell Netware 3.0.  The servers were all 3Com 3Server's and were connected using BNC Coax connection's and connected to the school districts mainframe via a dedicated frame relay.

One day, we get a call from a guidance counselor that her printer had stopped working.  We had been diagnosing some connection problems between some of the servers and the mainframe.  Since the printers were all connected to dedicated workstations/servers we thought maybe her server was experiencing connection problems.

The system administrator and I go down to her office and before our eyes we see smoke coming out of the printer, a plant hanging above the printer and water dripping down from the plant into said printer.  We informed her that she should move her plant and that we would get her a new one.

We retrieve a new printer from our office and bring it back down to her office.  Just as we are entering her office, we see her in the process of rehanging her plant, ABOVE THE SERVER!!!  ""STOP!!!"", shout's the systems administrator.  ""Water and electronics do not mix, your printer is dead because you got water in it from watering your plant.  You need to put your plant somewhere else.""  The systems administrator suggested a few safe places in her office.  Luckily for us, she chose one of those safe places.

It was this day that I learned some people are extremely dense when it comes to common sense and diagnosing cause and effect.",talesfromtechsupport,1222,1572967171

She says she can't remotely from home anymore.  Her and her husband have work laptops that they leave at home, they use these laptops to connect into the office with a VPN and then once on the VPN they use remote desktop to connect to their PCs in the office.

I tell her to bring her laptop to their office and I'll figure out what the problem is.  So I meet her at their office, connect her laptop to my mobile hotspot, connect to the VPN just fine and then remotely connect to her office computer.  It all works fine.  She just says huh, packs up the laptop and I figure it was just a glitch or something at the time she tried and she never tried again.

The next day I get a call from her and she's super pissed off. She's going on about how I don't know what I'm doing, how she can't believe I can't fix the problem, etc..  She's yelling at me saying she's at home and her laptop won't connect and I need to come to their house right away to fix it because she has to get payroll done. Ok, I head over to her house and start troubleshooting.

Almost immediately I notice the laptop is connected to WiFi but can't get out to the internet. When I show her that her laptop doesn't have an internet connection she says: ""Well of course it doesn't. I canceled the internet at home. I figured since I always remote into my work computer and use the internet on that, I didn't need to pay for internet at two places.""

So I had to explain to her why she needed internet at her home.

xelle24,The Mystery of the Constantly Crashing CPU,"Forgive me for any incorrect terminology, I'm not actually in IT, but I helped IT solve a mystery.

At the company I work for, most of us use these little bitty [Lenovo Thinkstations](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/think-workstations/thinkstation-p-series-tiny-/ThinkStation-P330-Tiny/p/33TS3TP330X).  They're fine for what we do.

Last summer we hired on several new people. One of them had constant problems with their Thinkstation shutting down randomly, sometimes several times a day.  IT switched out Thinkstations, cables, checked the electric lines to the cubicle, switched them to a different cubicle - all to no avail.  They even switched my Thinkstation with New Hire's machine - I had no problems, and New Hire continued to experience random shut downs with my previously flawlessly working machine.

Then, one fine day, New Hire complained that their Thinkstation had shut down yet again.  I happened to be standing nearby and I noticed something...unusual.  I called up IT right away and asked: could this be causing the mysterious shut downs?

Within minutes, the IT person who had been taking point on the problem showed up to see for themselves.  They then carefully lifted New Hire's glass coffee mug off the top of the Thinkstation and explained that we do not use the computer equipment as a coaster/mugwarmer, because the hot glass mug was poorly insulated and was overheating the Thinkstation.

New Hire now has the little stand so that the Thinkstation rests upright on the narrow side and can't be used as a coaster, and there have been no more shutdowns.  New Hire is reportedly not very happy with this development, as they no longer have an excuse for taking forever to get any work done.  I don't think New Hire is going to last much longer here, but IT and I are happy.",talesfromtechsupport,1607,1572920080

Our customers were often in the 60+ age range, so the issue was less likely to be super technical, and more an issue of guiding them through the obvious without sounding patronising. Cue sweet lady:

Me: Hello, Office here, how can I help?

SL: I’m taking the online course and no matter what answer I put in it’s always saying I’m wrong! Then I have to repeat the whole section! I’ve tried over and over! This cost me a lot of money and I have to finish it today! 

Me: ok, which section and question are you on? I’ll just check a few things..

We’d just moved to a new system, and some errors had been found in the past few days. So I looked it up on our master list, checked the website backend, and tested the front end with a dummy account.

Me: I’ve checked our side, and that question should definitely be multiple choice answer E. 

SL: But there is no answer E!

Me: Have... have you tried scrolling down? 

Pause.

SL: oh god I’m so sorry! 

Me: No worries it happens to all of us!",talesfromtechsupport,676,1572887583

Said user then went to the manager of the organisation and demanded we are removed from our roles. An important point in this would be that we were both only 2 weeks into the job as we were replacing a third party team in exchange for our in house support.

This back and forth went on for another hour or so until we eventually even got round to going to see the issue.

You guessed it.

bpeaceful2019,Irate Pizza Store Owner,"I have been reading a lot of these lately, and wanted to share the only story that really stands out to me. For a little background, I work in a local Telephone Co in a small town. This company is based in said town. We offer home phone, internet, cable, and security systems. We'll call this company smalltelco.

I have been there in tech support two years this month, however this story takes place about 6 months after I first started, when I was still on day shift. It is important to note, that if a customer requires a tech visit, AKA trouble ticket, Businesses are almost always same day, and residential is same day if you call before 12 P.M., or next day after that.

So here I am waiting for my next call when the phone rings. I answer, and the gentleman, already a little loud and belligerent, says his internet is down at his business, and he is now unable to process credit card payments. I get his information, pull up the account, and see that it is a fairly new local pizza place in the next town over. I pull up his modem to take a look, and every single level on it that could be bad, was bad.

At this point I ask him have they changed anything recently, but the answer was no. We do a little more troubleshooting, resetting from my end, power cycling the modem and router, unplugging, and resetting the coax cable, but every time the levels still come up bad. At this point I inform him that we will have to put in a ticket to have a tech come out. 

At this point it is important to not what I said about wait times earlier. Business is normally same day, however this guy was a special case. We are a local business our self, and sometimes to help out new local businesses, our CSR's will allow the business to have a residential account. It's a little cheaper, and helps local businesses stay in town. This is the case with this guy. It is also around 1:30 at this point, which means it would more than likely be the next day before a tech could go out. I inform him of this, and he blows up. I let him know, I am sorry, but there are people that had called in before him, that had issues just as important. He ends up cursing me out, and demanding my supervisor, who told him the same as I did.

The next day was very slow, so I decided to look at the ticket and see if it was worked yet. It was. I looked under the tab that tells what the problem was. Customer cut coax cable, and installed their own splitter. Apparently they did not do it correctly. The best part is, because he lied about anything changing during the call, and the fact that the issue was caused by something he did, he was charged $75 for the service call. Also, because he was so rude, I'm pretty sure they switched him to a business account, which gave him a higher rate, but a tech could get out same day in the future.",talesfromtechsupport,1043,1572654956
NotYourNanny,"When ""help desk"" really means ""help us"" not ""we'll help you.""","On my recent trip to the two stores we bought that are 300 miles away from the home office (and home), I had many tasks to perform. But when I arrived, I found that I couldn't perform some of them at one of the stores because it had been offline for three days.

The telco in question is, hands down, the worst phone company in the world. If you've dealt with them, you know who I'm talking about. If you haven't, you should praise the heavens at your good fortune.

They were saying at the time that, despite this business account being offline for three days already, it would be the next day before they could have a tech on the scene. But they managed to get someone out that day anyway. They couldn't tell the truth even when it would make us happy. (I suspect they grabbed the first janitor they could find and sent him out just to shut us up. He was even more inept than usual, even for the worst telco in the world.)

So the tech arrives, and I get a call to run up there from the other store to . . . keep an eye on things, I guess. I arrive to find him fumbling helplessly, trying to reprogram the modem (yeah, it's on bonded DSL, and there's no other option available, because it's *that* telco).

At this point, in chatting with the store manager, who had been working with their ""help"" desk, I found out that while there was a (probably wind storm related) outage three days ago, the real problem now what the ""help"" desk had told him to do a factory reset on the modem. Which set it to DHCP, when we had to have a static IP for the VPN. So the ""help"" desk *insisted* the circuit was up and running, but nothing worked because the modem had a different IP than what our firewall was using as a gateway. And that was somehow our fault.

So the tech is standing there with a document on his table with *detailed* instructions on how to reprogram the modem, and all the network settings needed (which was also on a label on the modem itself), and he had absolutely no clue what to type into where. I literally had to point to each text box on his table and tell him ""type this number in there.""

Five minutes later, we were back online. Sigh.",talesfromtechsupport,948,1572627435
pinky0926,"If an app is presented in a forest but there's no phone around to display it, does it make sense?","This one is on me, to be honest. 

We have a web portal software package with a progressive web app that for all intents and purposes is an app. It does app things. You can download it from the app store. It has notifications and stuff. It'll work on pretty much any smartphone. With that said, it was originally designed as a web portal, and what you see on the app is exactly what you see when you login on a web browser. it's just been responsively designed to fit all the boxes onto a small screen in a way that makes sense.

So I demo this software frequently to existing clients that don't have it yet and to prospective clients. And the easiest way to demo this for 10 people in a room is on a big screen in the browser, so I open it in Chrome and go through all the features and functionality that way. I explain at the start that this is an app that you can download from the app store and carry on. 

And time and time again, I will get a response like this. The Managing Director or Ops Manager or CEO (whichever bigwig it is) will lean back slowly at the end of my spiel, put his hands together and say ""Ok this is all very good, however what we need is an *app*. Everything is about apps now in 2019. We want our clients to be able to use this on their phones on the go. Do you have an app?""

And every time, I have given the same response. ""Yes, it is an app! Let me show you"". Since pulling it out on my phone is impractical in this big meeting room with so many people, at that point I will click the Restore Down button on the top right of the browser, grab the edge of the browser window and shrink it down to the rough dimensions of a phone. As I do this all the elements contract and move about as you'd expect. ""As I said to begin with, this software will work on any device, so really regardless of whether you use an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy or an iPad or whatever, it is exactly the same suite of software as I've been showing you.""

And generally, the response to this is pretty tepid. Some people look unconvinced, others confused. Maybe one or two will get it. 

This continued to happen in pretty much every demo until I discovered a trick. In F12 developer tools, you can cycle through sepcific smartphone dimensions. What I didn't know is that this can also show you a frame around the window to mock a physical smartphone. I mean it will literally look like the edges of an iphone, button and bevel and everything. 

Toggling this on in front of clients and the penny finally drops. ""Oh yeah, this is great. Exactly what we need. An *app.*""",talesfromtechsupport,1133,1572606081
smohk1,I was fired because I made the customer feel stupid.,"I work in IT...and sometimes do support on the side for people/businesses (I'm sure most of us do or have done this). 

One of my long time customers recommended me to a local law firm and they called me up. Did a couple of support calls for them. All were easy things...setup a vpn connection between offices, poke holes in the firewalls for various things, a few minor AD tasks, stuff like that.

A couple of months in I got a call they would no longer need my services. Not a huge deal but I decided to ask why.

Turns out, I made the office mangler feel stupid because I was doing the things they asked too quickly and made it look easy.

evasive2010,Of slow cables,"About 20 years ago.

Our company is laying network cable at a customer location. CAT5E because it was finally time to expand the network to the other rooms. There is some existing cables already, specced CAT5 and checked both ends. There's a neat report about this.  


After everything is done, we have one user complaining about a slow connection to the server. We check and surely, 10Mbit is all we get. No matter how much we fiddle with the settings on the workstation or switch, 10Mbit, half duplex will work, anything other will not.   


Now then we follow the (existing old) cable where it should go. Strange, it's not going through the wall as expected per the drawing but up on the old false ceiling. Above the balcony. That is 4 meters high. Ok, any volunteers to go up there and crawl over 2x4 beams, 2 feet apart? 

So here we go. And halfway, we find it, this little 4-port HUB, a brand we've never heard of before. 10Mbit-only indeed. 

I guess what happened is they ran out of time, quickly ran the cable over the ceiling, found out it was more than 300ft and decided a no-name mini-hub was cheaper than doing it all over again.

jaxmagicman,Your employee lied to you,"We received a ticket Monday at 9:10.  At 9:11 we responded with troubleshooting steps.  When they didn't work the user called me at 9:15.  I walked her through some more and none of them worked.  Since the branch she was at was a 10 minute drive, I told her that I would need to send a tech and she would be out there in just a few minutes.  

9:30, 20 minutes after the ticket was put in the user's immediate boss called me and said that her employee was down and we weren't doing anything to help her.  I told her that yes we were, we did some troubleshooting and it didn't work, so I'm sending a tech out there, she is walking out the door now and should be there in the next 15 minutes.

At 9:40 the branch manager calls me and says that she has a teller who hasn't been able to work for 40 minutes and she was told we aren't doing anything to help.  I told her, that yes we are doing something, we troubleshot the basics and when that didn't work I sent a tech out there who should be arriving in the next 5 minutes.  Then she asked me why her employees weren't told that.  I mentioned that not only was the original teller told, but so was her headteller.  But she responded that they say we told them nothing.  I told her they were told and we record all our calls so I can send her the recordings.  I guess she thought I was lying, so I sent her the recording with the title that she was misinformed.  Also the ticket had been updated each time. 

The problem was fixed 3 minutes after the tech walked in the door.  Turns out neither teller, nor head teller knew how to turn off a computer that was frozen.  Troubleshooting steps included turning the computer off via the power button, they turned off the monitor instead.  When I tried to get them to unplug to get it to turn off, you guessed it, the unplugged the monitor.  They both said, they thought that was the computer and I never mentioned unplugging the modem.

Bootleather,The Janitor is my Superhero,"Hey all!

I have another story to tell since my one about 'the thing in the box' and 'your server is where?' did so well a while back! 

This is another tale from my time as an MSP technician and actually occurred at my very first MSP job.

This occurred back in September of 2013, for some of you this month might stand out because a certain something that rhymes with Ripto-Blocker started becoming big around this time. 

For story Purposes the Cast is as Follows!

#ME: Obvious, though at this point still a middle-range tech monkey.
#SDude: Sales 'professional'.
#TechDad: Senior technician at the company I worked at.
#Janitor: The hero of our story.

------

I had been working at this MSP for about a year now, things were going relatively well. I was kind of on the fast-track because #TechDad liked me and saw potential in me as his padawan, which meant I basically just followed him around all day and did help-desk monkey things while learning by osmosis. The company had it's share of problems but my tech-side coworkers were alright... Sales on the other hand as anybody from an MSP background can tell you was a MESS. It was pretty routine for our Sales 'professionals' to sell things that they did not understand, which meant they would often sell the wrong things to customers without consulting us first or make promises that were impossible to keep all in the name of closing a 'deal' which they way their pay was structured netted them a 'bonus' for the number of clients that they signed.

Enter #Sdude. This guy was your typical salesman, right down to wearing purple shirts with popped collars and gold chains, complete with spiked hair and fake tan. For some mysterious(tm) reason he was catnip to new customers and his sales numbers were insane... The mysterious reason is that he would promise them impossible things even MORE regularly than the other sales professionals. 

Anyway, #Sdude accosted #Me and #TechDad one day on our way into the building one day, accosted being the best word because the guy had clearly been waiting for #TechDad and basically sprung from the corner of the lobby like a goblin the moment he appeared. 

#SDude: Hey where have you been!? Why are you late?!
#TechDad: I work 8-6, it's 7:30. 
#SDude: Whatever, hey I have a hot prospect who needs support right now! I told them you would be leaving here an hour ago so you need to start driving!
#TechDad: What? What client? What's happening? 
#SDude: My new prospect, their gonna sign next week but they need help NOW! You need to go now!

A large argument ensues in the lobby with #TechDad demanding information and #Sdude demanding that he get in his car and drive to a so far non-contracted non-paying customer about forty-five minutes away. The owners of the company get involved. #SDude convinces them they smell money. #TechDad and I are in his car within the hour driving to an unknown location with unknown issues. 

We get onsite and without violating the rules of the sub a THING had happened and this very large, very old and very unprepared company had lost access to basically ALL of their data. Including, -gasp- the backups that they knew about. 

Now this was back in EARLY September so a lot of this was still new and we had not seen a lot of this particular kind of 'ware' before. We tell them the usual speil and then set to work with all the tricks and tools we can to try and recover this data which #SDude had helpfully told the customer was something we do all the time and could be completed in just an hour or so.

Needless to say several hours... Then over a day goes by before valiant #Techdad is about to admit defeat. There is nothing he can do. They have no good backups. Their data is irretrievable. The owners of our company are furious with #Techdad for not being able to fix it so he can get back to paying clients rather than with #Sdude who with their help roped him into it.

Then, as though sent from on high like an angel comes #Janitor.

He pokes his head into the server closet where we've setup our shop because he see's we've propped the door open. He's done this a few times over the past day or so mostly because he seemed to have an interest in tech even if he dident understand most of it.

#Janitor: Hey fellas any luck?
#Me: Not so much. 
#Janitor: Did anybody show you the server?
#Me -glances over at the server-
#Janitor: Naw! The one I take care of!
#Techdad -perks up at this and asks what server he means- 

So #Janitor takes us across the building to a small room that was clearly an old server closest... In which we found a working Tape Backup system... This #Janitor had been tasked YEARS ago with swapping the tapes in and out of this machine by some arcane I.T department of the past and had faithfully done his duty for years... Even figuring out how to order new tapes and label them. 

Needless to say some of the data was still corrupt but we managed to recover their network to a reasonable period from before the 'incident' and got a multi-million dollar company back on their feet...

All thanks to #Janitor who is and always will be my hero.",talesfromtechsupport,1496,1572382937
rentacle,"""Google has stopped working!""","I'm not strictly speaking in tech support, but I've learned the arcane art of turning things off and on again and so I'm the go-to problem solver in my office. Yesterday at 4:50pm I got this fun call from my boss that I needed to ""fix her google"" and I was sorely tempted to pretend I was not there and run out of the door. Against my better judgement I stayed on the phone.

For context, my boss is a woman in her late 40s who knows how to use word/excel/powerpoint just enough to convince herself that she's good with computers. Spoiler: she's not. After a few questions I figured out her problem was that she needed a certain file that was on google drive and couldn't find it. She told me that the search function was broken.

I searched for ""project Q3 2019"" (extremely generic search terms) from my account and the file *data\_for\_project\_Q3\_2019.whatevs* was something like the 6th result from the top. Told my boss as much but she insisted she couldn't find it. I gave her different search terms -- ""data project"", ""data Q3 2019"", etc -- no dice. Every time, the file would be among the first results for me, and my boss would say that she only found unrelated files and that her search was broken.

When she started with the conspiracy theories about google hiding her files, I gave up and went to her office to see for myself. I asked her to search for ""project Q3 2019"" again. She typed it, stared at the screen from a moment, then looked smug and told me that she couldn't find her file. I leaned over, *pressed the effing Enter key*, and told her that her file was right there.

&gt;Boss: Wait, what did you do?! Do that again! Explain it to me!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I... pressed the enter key?  
&gt;  
&gt;Boss: How does that work?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Uh... It works like any other search function... You type the thing you want to search for, and then press Enter...  
&gt;  
&gt;Boss: But why didn't they make it clear that you need to press Enter??

In case you didn't know, as you're typing in the search box google drive shows you a dropdown preview with the top 4/5 results that it thinks you might want. Obviously, if your result is not there, you press Enter to see all search results. Or, if you're my boss, you just stare at the screen blankly and your fist at the merciless google gods.

Anyway that's the story of how I fixed an entire broken google all by myself with a single keystroke and was out of the office by 5:10pm.",talesfromtechsupport,1761,1572341692
pukeforest,"""Thanks for doing the impossible on such short notice. Now do it again. Twice.""","Okay everyone. Here it is.

This, so far, was the ONE holy-shit story I was going to tell once I got a new job, but I'm preemptively telling it - maybe for good luck?

It's taken a good two weeks to calm down. I'm a pretty patient guy, but this makes me steam just thinking about it again.

Let me set the stage for you:

Friday morning. Happy it's finally Friday. The flowers smell sweeter. I walk through the baby-vomit colored halls to my office, and greet my co-worker -- the only other IT staff in this dozen+ building, multi-acre campus with nearly 1,000 users. 

I grab a styrofoam cup and instant coffee mix to make my coffee, as we are no longer allowed to bring in outside food or beverages (the people who work with me will REALLY know who I am now).

""Hey, co-worker! I think I have a good game-plan for this backlog of upgrades to install today, let me get my notes --""

*BANG BANG BANG BANG* goes the office door.

There he is. 

I open it to find our Director, breathing heavily, eyes bulging ($D1 from here on out).

$D1: ""Why aren't you guys in $LAB_A??""

Me, flabbergasted: "".. are we SUPPOSED TO BE?""

$D1: ""You were supposed to tear down $LAB_A, $LAB_B, and $LAB_C 15 MINUTES AGO!!!""

Me, shaking my head: ""where is the e-mail on this??"" I sit at my computer, start searching for the current date. ""Teardown"". ""LAB_NAME"". NOTHING.

$D1: ""I know I sent it to you guys!!""

Me: ""Could you please re-send it?""

$D1 runs back to his office. 30 seconds later I have an email from him, with a lengthy document attached, detailing the restructuring of these three computer labs.

Let me pause for a minute to remark on how ASTONISHED I was. 

I was absolutely, positively, taken aback.

Here, in my inbox, evidence of nearly 3 weeks of planning between a dozen managers, meeting minutes, 20+ pages of how this was going to happen, even down to time blocks of how IT was going to assist. 

Upper management clearly thought this was important, and actually MANAGED a PROJECT.

Only they 

NEVER. 
TOLD. 
US. 
ABOUT. 
IT.

Oh, I can still feel the rage building. Breathe, pukeforest..

Anyway, $coworker and I book it to the labs post-haste, and rip all the computers and peripherals and put them in isolated locations. 

I think there were roughly 30 computers per room. We are human blurs, getting them out of the way for the remodeling team. We finished seconds before they started demoing the areas.

I thumbed again through the hefty, and oddly, PLANNED, email documentation. Next steps for IT - begin rebuilds of $LAB_A, $LAB_B, and $LAB_C Monday. 

Cool. Contractors will work through the rooms all day today and over the weekend as needed.

Rest of the day goes oddly smooth. Well, almost.

Email from $D1: 

""What is the status of $LAB_A and $LAB_B? They need to be operational before 0800 Monday morning.""

This was about 5 minutes before it was time for my day to end and my weekend to begin. 

I slammed my door so hard I thought the glass was going to break.
I RUN to $LAB_A and $LAB_B, the rooms are done, furniture in place, paint still drying. I am THROWING machines on desks. Somehow I completed a miracle -- two labs, nearly 60 PCs and printers - done in 45 minutes or so.

Out of breath, I knock on $D1's door on my way out. 

Me: ""$LAB_A and $LAB_B are rebuilt. Is $LAB_C still a go for Monday? We have some outstanding items but I'll take care of it on my lunch break Monday to make it work.""

$D1: ""That will be fine.""

Monday comes around. Busy as ever. Showing people how to print who magically forgot over the weekend.

Remembering $LAB_C, I head there on my lunch break and get it all in line, and up and running. I send an email to all involved that the final lab is now up and operational. Keep in mind, $LAB_C is about a half mile from our main site and usually you have to walk there.

*NOTE - I actually had to step out of the room before I wrote the rest of this story*

About 10 minutes before I am set to leave, I get an e-mail from $D1.

""Please make sure $LAB_C is operational by 0800 tomorrow. Thank you - $D1""

I began typing ""Thanks, but I already took care of -"" when my stomach sank. I began the half-mile trek to $LAB_C, with growing despair every step of the way.

I open the door, and..

The room had been completely moved around. 30+ PCs disconnected with no semblance of care by upper management. Ethernet ports RIPPED OUT of walls by people just yanking the Cat5 cables. 

Things plugged into wrong ports with the wrong VLAN configurations. No regard for the actual architecture, everything just wantonly thrown around and told to ""fix it"".

Guys, upon seeing this, I literally fell to my knees. 
I dropped my keys on the floor. 

I can still recall that feeling; I wanted to weep.
Dutifully, I spent the requisite time that evening getting EVERYTHING going. Needed to run new ethernet cabling and everything.

I never said a word. Next I checked on the room, it was in use. 

I'm still exhausted, weeks later.",talesfromtechsupport,1399,1572304493
chrisbucks,"""but I want to keep everything from the network storage (300tb) available on the desktop PC! (1tb hdd)""","I work as a semi-sys admin/fix it man in a small TV station.  Because of the cross over of IT and broadcast engineering we typically let the broadcast engineers have free reign over their equipment including work stations.  I started noticing that all the desktop PCs were hitting 99% full on the local disk, so I went in to investigate.

I found that Swedish Colleague #1 (Swe#1) had turned on ""Keep Offline"" on all of our attached network storage.  The network storage is about 300tb.  And so Windows was diligently caching as much as it could to the local drive.

&gt; **Me:** You can just walk out of the building if that happens, because then the whole TV station is off-air.

Swe#1 has also created short cuts to all the attached network drives from the normal admin workstation, and then copied those short cuts to every other computer in the building.  Naturally none of these shortcuts work because they don't have those drive letters mounted.

Swe#1 also wrote a proposal to one of our clients about automating video file transcoding and movement with the method of transfer writing as ""using Windows protocol"".",talesfromtechsupport,1942,1572266403

Yes, I'm still in the same job. I've quietly said this here a few times, I give up the right to complain, knowing what I'm in for, since my 'resignation' from past stories didn't quite take effect (and I'm actively looking for new employment).

But this story is special. 
Gather round, and listen to pukeforest's latest tale of miscommunication and inefficiency.

A few weeks ago, the IT department (all two of us, me included), was contacted by HR to facilitate training for ""computer basics"" for users. Oh yes, this magical Friday, the sole TWO IT personnel are going to instruct, and magically solve all computer problems for nearly 1,000 users.

We agree to do so. A month goes by, and reminders of our commitment flood our inboxes.

Trainings sitewide change all over the map in the days previous to our ""big training day"". From cafeteria to conference room - room numbers and floors are a blur. 

Exhausted from replacing nearly 100 endpoints a day due to an impending upgrade, us, as TWO PEOPLE that constitute an ENTIRE IT DEPARTMENT partner with our direct manager to dial HR to confirm the location and time of training.

""$time, at $location"" says HR manager.

Great.

30 minutes before, the entire IT department (again, both of us) verbally CONFIRM with manager we are giving ""computer basic training"" for nearly a thousand users (including ""what is a mouse"", ""what is an e-mail"", and other amazing concepts) at $time and $location. 

When we express our concern that nobody is showing up, an announcement is made over loudspeaker.

Nobody shows. This sort of thing has happened a few times in my employment.

Check my email later, saying that $HR is ""very disappointed"" and ""infuriated"" that the training did not occur at $location that we were not in agreement with, and had never heard about until that moment.

Kuebic,"Everyone's Having Printer Issues, Except One.","I work part-time at a local pharmacy.  People are nice and pretty smart.  Although I'm not the official IT guy, they know I built a computer and assumes I know more about computers than they do, so any time a printer doesn't print or a mouse doesn't mouse, they call me.  They do have a remote IT department they could call, but they're typically very slow to reach and they find it's quicker to just call me over if I'm around.

As I walk into work couple weeks ago, I was greeted with requests to take a look at pretty much everyone's computers.  Almost everyone for the past couple days has been having printing issues that won't go away.  Their workaround for the time-being was restarting the print spooler(!?), but that often didn't work immediately and the issue would always return.

The situation: 

* All printers having issues were Lexmark brand
* Best way to reproduce the error is to bombard the printer with multiple print requests (which happens very often at the pharmacy)
* Waiting for previous print to finish before printing another would provide best chances of success (but not practical in pharmacy environment)
* All fourteen Windows 10 computers (except one) suffered the same issue.  
* All four Windows 7 computers (except a different one) were printing fine.

Apparently, they have been calling the remote IT department, which is where they learned restarting print spooler helped a little bit, but they were left at ""We don't fully support Lexmark printers, we'll get back to you after we do additional research."" and they haven't called back since.

Given that I actually work at the pharmacy and only did the IT stuff whenever there was down-time, it took most of the day just to survey the situation, as all I was told was ""printers don't work well, and remote IT doesn't know what to do.""  By the end of the day I still didn't know what to do.  

As only our Lexmark printers were affected, I surveyed Lexmark forums, blogs, and google-fu'ed like a madman in hopes of someone else coming across a similar issue with a solution.  I even tried looking through recent Microsoft blogs, forums, and a similar flurry of google-fu in hopes of coming across a lead.  Nothing.  I decided to sleep on it.

The next day things started to click into place.  The only Windows 7 computer having issues printing is actually printing to a Lexmark printer being shared by a Windows 10 computer.  Is the crux of the issue Windows 10?

Checked recent windows 10 updates.  There was a cumulative update from October 3rd and under ""known issues"":

&gt;Applications and printer drivers that leverage the Windows Javascript engine (jscript.dll) for process print jobs might experience blah blah blah...

The fix?

&gt;This issue was resolved in \[link to update\]. 

The update for the fix was just posted that day.

I walked around updating people's computers when they had downtime and solved (most of) their printing issues.  It felt good.

And that one Win10 computer that didn't have issues?  The user constantly postpones windows updates and never installed the problematic update.",talesfromtechsupport,1739,1572108148
UnknownTehk,You cut what!!!,"So this didn't happen to me but rather a coworker at the time. I am going to tell it the best I can.

My coworker and I worked on a help desk for tier 1 troubleshooting at a financial institution. We only took calls for internal clients and the actual stores around the country. We did internet troubleshooting, printers, phones, and DSL lines. So we always had the usual ""The computer doesn't work"" when it was really off.

Now on to the main event:

My coworker got a call from a center stating that their internet is down. He pings the router and all is good. However he is unable to ping any of the computers. He gets them set up on the back up Dial-Up. The store calls him back their cell phone. He continues to work on finding the reason for the outage. After about an hour of troubleshooting they decided to start again the next day.

The next day arrives and he continues to troubleshoot the issue. Eventually he had the store trace the wire from the router to the switch and ensure that they are plugged in properly. Connections on both ends are good. Well that's a no go. He is asking some questions and finally the store said the following:

Store: ""Recently we did some renovations and there was a blue cable going across the top of the door and we cut it so they could paint the wall.""

You could hear my coworkers soul just break. He put them on hold and took off his headset and looked defeated. After a minute he got back on the phone and asked them why they just cut random cables. They responded that didn't think it was important. Eventually we ended up getting a technician dispatched to their location to fix the issue. 

Moral if the story: Don't cut random cables.",talesfromtechsupport,2479,1572018044
bigjilm123,Overheard on a Train,"There are truly wonderful people in this world.  This post is about of of the other ones. 

I’m riding the train right now, and I’m forced to overhear Karen’s indignant rant about her helpdesk. Billy and Stan - you guys need our love, because you’re definitely not getting it from her. 

Karen: ... and i told them it doesn’t work!  It hasn’t worked for me a for a long time. No, the other people using this machine don’t have the same problem, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a problem!

I raised a ticket and I just said “call me for details”.  Do they call?  No, they send an email because they work a different shift. If I wanted to email them, I would have said email in the ticket...  blah blah...

Billy finally comes over to the computer and, of course, the problem doesn’t happen while he’s here. He messes around with it, and I told him I need to get back to work, so he gets up to leave. 

I pick up the keyboard and slam it on the desk, because sometimes that causes the problem. Stan comes over and made me tell him the whole story again.  I don’t need two people’s help, just one competent one!

Finally, they notice a setting isn’t right and they fix it. Of course it wasn’t right, but they never listen. 

I decided to not use the computer anymore. Someone else can use it, but I don’t trust it. Oh, and they still haven’t responded to my ticket to ask for them to set up a conference call for me. It’s been TWO YEARS and they still haven’t showed up.  How am I supposed to do my work if they just ignore these tickets?!?

The rant switched to a coworker that messed up the till count or something. Rest assured, Karen doesn’t save her rage for her help desk guys.

CafeteriaBacon,"It's not a PC, it's a COW. And it's shattered...","One fine day at the Hospital helpdesk, we got a call from the ER. One of their COWs (computer on wheels) was broken. They were having a busy day and needed it back in action ASAP, could we please come fix it now?

What happened to it, we ask? They’re not sure. We can’t speak to the user, he’s on break.

Swiping through the ER door, we’re greeted by the sight of a COW with a well and truly shattered screen. With a look and a shrug, we wheeled it down to our office. 

Before we had a chance to start thinking about how we could solve this, our boss, ContractorX walked through the door. He saw it and started asking silly questions like “what the hell happened to that thing?” and “can we even fix that?”

We didn’t have an answer for any of that.

You see, we were in a bit of a pickle. The COWs cost $25k all told, and we didn’t keep spares. The PC was $20k worth of “it costs this much because it’s medical grade” mediocrity, and the wheelie bit was made to order, direct from Elbonia, 6 week lead time, cash up front. Also, the wheelie cart would only fit that model PC. Which was discontinued. Two years before we bought it...

As a bonus, we’d blown though the IT budget six months ago.  If we even mentioned this to Accounting, we were dead. Whatever they were getting, it wasn’t going to be new…

After a good collective panic, CX declared that the next step was finding “whodunit”. We bopped back up to the ER, in search of the user.

We never found him, but we did speak to one of our favorite nurses, who said that $MassiveNurse was using it when “it rolled away and smashed into a cabinet”.

Relaying this news to CX didn’t help much, but we all agreed that $MassiveNurse wasn’t the sort of guy to go breaking things, and there was no proof of anything, which meant we couldn’t bill the ER for its replacement. CX wasn’t happy about that, but it ‘tis what it ‘tis.

So for a couple days, we scrounged and scrounged. All we could find was a spare power cord, and an empty COW battery charger. The ER folks were getting mad. Flu season was in full swing and they had been at 150% capacity for weeks. Bigwigs were calling other bigwigs. It was about to be a Big Deal.

We were panicking. We thought we were screwed until someone realized that $IT_RN had kept a COW in her office for testing. For the past 3 years. Without a power cord. Or batteries.

So we took it. Imaged it and deployed it. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy. $IT_RN wasn’t happy, but that’s like saying the sun set yesterday...

The shattered carcass sat in our office for weeks until one hectic day when $Hippie walked past it and pretend-punched it. He did a quick double take and screamed “ROLLED INTO A CABINET! LUHMAO! MAN YOU GUYS GOTTA SEE THIS!”

We all went over for a look.

KaitieLoo,My Computer Isn't Off and You Need To Fix It,"Phone call came into the helpdesk and as per usual, one of my students took the phone call. It's from a cell phone, so little did I know the sh!t show that was coming. 

On the phone was one of our frequent fliers, and a disagreeable one at that. As my coworker describes her, ""she is the kind of person who thinks she'll get what she wants from you by punching you in the face first"". 

Our cast is simple. $Cait = Myself, $James = My student, $admin = office admin and $Sally = the patron from hell. 

&gt;$James: (calling from helpdesk) Hey, uh... Cait? Can you take this phone call? They're having issues remoting into their computer and are getting kind of... mean...  
$Cait: Who is it?  
$James: Sally.

Oh sh!t. 

&gt;$Cait: Yeah, I'll take it. 

I kind of take a moment to prepare myself and pick up the phone. 

&gt;$Cait: University Helpdesk, this is Cait speaking, how can I help you?  
$Sally: I need you to fix my computer. I'm giving a presentation at $remotecampus in 30 minutes and I cannot remote in.  
$Cait: (checking deployment console) Well... It looks like your computer is off.   
$Sally: Well can you go turn it on?  
$Cait: Unfortunately, I am unable to do that given that we are understaffed and dealing with a ton of classroom calls. Additionally, our policy is such as that we don't turn people's computers on unless we are working on them. You can ask $admin in your office to turn it on for you.   
$Sally: I need this done now and it's going to take forever to get a hold of $admin because everyone has phone trees and can't you just do your job for once? 

Here's where I should note... To get a hold of $admin, you can call their publicly listed phone number. Additionally, $admin is in the same office area, which I am 20 minutes walking distance from the building (we aren't provided cars for some really dumb reason). 

&gt;$Cait: Unfortunately, I am unable to do so... I'm sure if you call admin....  
$Sally: She's going to take forever to get through though. Please do your job. Besides, if the computer is on but not on the network, $admin couldn't fix it.   
$Cait: I'm sorry, but I can't do that for you. I know it might seem like it's just offline but it is actually powered off.I don't think $admin will have an issue, and if she does, then she can just call us.   
$Sally: Thanks for nothing. (click)

I close out her record silently stating that she doesn't want to cooperate. Then, I notice her computer coming online in the deployment console and her logging in. About two minutes after that, I get a phone call from her... 

&gt;$Sally: So I called $admin... She was able to turn my computer on. It was off. So thanks for nothing.

Martydom99,But it's not fair that the university doesn't have unlimited funds!,"Background: I work for my university's help desk. My job consists of answering phone calls/emails. 90% of the problems are log in issues and such which are resolved in &lt;5 minutes. 

  
I wasn't apart of this incident, but it is very well known across my colleagues. For my uni, Adobe Creative Suite can be accessed for free on all campus computers and full-time staff, but if a student wants to access it at home, they can purchase it at a discounted price. So, one day, we got an email from a student who was pretty upset with this. (This is paraphrased for the most part)

  
Client: Why can't I access ACS on my personal computer?! It should be available for all students and not just staff!

  
Help Desk: Adobe Creative Cloud can be used on campus for students in computer labs. Here is more info"" moreinfo..com

  
Client: THAT DOESN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION! This should be able to be used at home for students!

  
Help Desk:  The uni's Adobe license only covers full-time employees. This is why it's not available at home. 

  
Client: Then the uni should look into alternative options. This limits students' productivity. With what I'm paying for this school, it should be included (fair point). This also is an administrative issue, the help desk shouldn't be answering these questions. 

  
(BUT YOU EMAILED THE- nevermind) This ticket was then marked as resolved. Oh boy, did they not like that.   
Client: This issue is not resolved. Grow up. 

  
This client then called the direct help desk line to berate whoever picked up. A supervisor then made a note saying if this person called again, to direct them to the manager of the whole department. This was pretty big because she is never in direct contact with any of us. We then sent him a recap of the situation to make sure he has all the info that we gave him.

cockadoodleinmyass,"Coloured tags, ISO 20000 processes, £12 of lost revenue, and accusations of ‘Unauthorised Leaks’ by Security Cleared staff","I’d expect most readers here have heard of ITIL, a set of best practices for service management, often adopted by the clueless directors of understaffed and overworked IT departments in an attempt to boost effectiveness and efficiency.  Such drives oft result in the production of process documentation that is so far removed from how staff work and what they do that said processes would rank alongside 50 Shades of Grey in WHSmith’s fiction Book Charts were they one day published, with said processes also leading to unrealistic SLAs underpinned by fantastical garbage, and inspiring nonsensical jargon filled emails to staff, and all justified by the single phrase ‘we work to ITIL and ITIL says this is how we should work’.

I have heard that line too many times from too many people and it inspires such rage in me because, what said managers often fail to realise is that, to steal a line from the great Captain Barbossa, *’ITIL is more what you’d call “guidelines” than actual rules’*.  That is, ITIL doesn’t say anything; it merely suggests, and you pick and choose those suggestions that best suit the way you work, implementing them in your business processes.

If you want rules, you adopt ISO 20000, something you’d be crazy to do unless you had to, say you were working for a large outsourcing company with major government contracts that depended on your having the certification.  Because, in ISO 200000 … well … probably the simplest way to put it is that ISO 20000 is ITIL on steroids; every could becomes a should, may becomes a must, suggestion becomes a rule.  It is a standard that you are certified in, requiring the drawing up of ~30 processes that you are expected to work to because you will be audited on them and you risk losing contracts if you fail to follow them.

Some years ago, I worked for such a company on a government contract, one of several that included adherence to ISO 20000 in their terms.  This company, however, was going through some rough times, losing money, cutting costs, and selling off business units to raise capital and stay alive.  In one such cost saving measure, my business unit was forced to change their stationary supplier to a cheaper alternative.  This led to complaints throughout the office, with staff being unable to order their favourite brand of rollerball pen, no more multicoloured post it notes, and envelopes that weren’t sticky enough.  But, after a year or so, people got used to the reduced range of stock on offer.

We improved, we adapted, and we overcame.

However, the shit hit the fan when we ran out of coloured tags.  Tags like these: https://i.imgur.com/jv6pl1n.jpg

You see, we our contracts involved the management of a large number of hardware assets, retrieving them from various customers for reconfiguration, refurbishment, testing, repair and disposal, then returning them more often than not exactly the same device they sent us when it turned out nothing was wrong.

With around 80,000 devices managed by our team across multiple contracts, and around 1,000 devices held on site at any one time as stock or at various stages through the repair cycle, we relied on a system that used tags to quickly identify the state of said stocks: a green tag indicated working stock, yellow indicated a fault that could likely be repaired in-house, red indicated a a fault that needed to be sent back to the manufacturer, and black indicated a device due for disposal. When a device was ready for dispatch to a user, the tag would be removed and a form would be wrapped around or stuck to the device, indicating the customer, incident or change number, configuration, delivery address, etc.

So when we started to run low on some of these coloured tags and went to order more, we were shocked when we discovered our new stationary supplier only sold tags in one colour: brown.

We informed our manager of the issue, who raised it with our on-site facilities representative, who said there was nothing that could be done.  He decided to go over her head to the head of facilities, who said that the decision to change supplier had been made at a group level, rather than a divisional level, so nothing could be done.  He then went to the stores department, who gave a similar response; they had no other suppliers on the books that we could use, so nothing could be done.  So he referred it to the Support Director, who raised it with the Operations Director, who told us to buy the brown tags and deal with it.

You might be wondering why my manager and our Support Director made such a fuss out of coloured tags.  You might be wondering why we didn’t just buy the brown tags and be done with it.

The reason why this wasn’t an option was because the Incident Management Processes for several contracts referenced the use of these coloured tags at multiple stages throughout the documents, and our Asset Management Processes referenced the tags just as many times.  The approvals process for changes made to what totalled 14 impacted processes would have taken months.  And we had just a few weeks’ worth of yellow tags left.  During the interim, we’d be in violation of all these processes, and, with a newly won contract with ISO 20000 in the terms due to start in just three months, we had a certification audit due in the next six weeks.  An audit we would fail if we started to use brown tags.  A failure that would cost the division its certification, thus contracts worth around third of its revenue.

We had to have these coloured tags.  And we had to have them now.

When this was pointed out to the Operations Director, he requested our finance team open a new account with another stationary supplier.  This was rejected, so the Operations Director escalated the issue to the Divisional COO, who raised it with the Divisional CFO, who go it done.  Once the account was setup, my team leader placed the order, for a cost of around £12.

Less than 24 hours later, the tags arrived, and we continued with business as usual, putting this tedious drawn out issue to rest.  Until a couple of weeks later when my team leader got an email from someone he didn’t recognise, marked ‘High Priority’, with a subject containing the phrase ‘Unauthorised Leakage’.

My team leader was known for being a seriously chill guy, always calm, composed, well spoken, and I only heard him swear on two occasions in the three years I worked with him.  His reaction to this email was one of those two occasions.

&gt;**”Oh my fucking God.”**

You could hear the office collectively stop anything they were doing when he muttered those words.  And it’s worth noting that, due to the contracts and clients we had, we were all security cleared, at least to an SC level, in some cases to a DV level.  We were List X contractor, and he was one of the holders of the keys to the sacred room nobody spoke about.  *Seriously.  That room.  It doesn’t exist.*  So when he saw the words ‘Unauthorised Leakage’ in the subject … well … I don’t think I need to elaborate further.

But then he opened the email, scrolled to the bottom to see who the sender was, and realised that it had come from the Group’s Financial Fraud team.  And then he read the email and realised that it was just our company being our company.

You see, it turned out that this new stationary supplier we had adopted over a year earlier was actually owned by the group.  The same was the case with our IT hardware supplier, our IT support provider, our facilities contractors, and so on.  It was often more expensive to use these *internal* suppliers than go external, but it meant that the group’s accountants could gather together and have a good circlejerk over how many profitable businesses the company had.  We made money off government contracts, our internal suppliers made money off us, why only have one *profitable* business when you have two or three or more, all fed by the same single golden goose?

By going to an external stationary supplier over the approved internal one, we had denied our approved internal one £12 of revenue, thus £12 had leaked from the business.  And my team leader was facing a group led disciplinary hearing and the removal of his access to SAP as a result.  Cue even more waste of time emails to the Support Director, Operations Director, Divisional COO and Divisional CFO, who were thankfully able to swiftly clear things up.

See why I described ISO 20000 as ITIL on steroids?  Who would have thought that £12 worth of coloured tags could cause such a ruckus …",talesfromtechsupport,1754,1571771830
TheUsualUzbeks,Replication is the first stage of problem resolution.,"There’s nothing worse than a  intermittent problem you can’t replicate…..

Some years earlier than [this story about a rattling car](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/dk97z9/debugging_a_luxury_car/) I was working for a different up-market vehicle manufacturer.

They were just about to launch their first highly expensive off-road vehicle – this was near the beginning of the trend that lead (via the chelsea tractor) to today’s ubiquitous SUV.

They’d hired an off-road circuit for a couple of weeks to rehearse the press launch.

A day or so before the launch they had a **bonding day for the senior management team** at the off-road site.

Seniors managers would, one by one, be kitted up like racing drivers (fire-proof padded jump suit, helmet, goggles, gloves) and strapped in beside a trained stunt driver for a bumpy ride around the track.

No all of them were keen to do this. The finance director was uneasy, and it didn’t help when the car with the manager before him **hit a bump on a corner and rolled over a few times**. (No one was hurt – the rolled over manager was comforted by paramedics while the vehicle was hauled round the back to be hammered back into pristine shape for the next day; and the driver took a coffee break).

But the finance director is unhappy as he’s strapped into the next vehicle with the next driver. “It’s all going to be fine” the driver tells him as they shoot off. “…. You see, the mistake my colleague made was ….. When he got to here ….. he did THIS”. The vehicle hits the same bump, at the same angle and speed. And **rolls over the same way.**

**Resolution**: Probable user error. Advise updating documentation. 

**Temporary fix**: Use supplied hammers.

**TL;DR:** Driver error.",talesfromtechsupport,1262,1571734560

db_dev,Database Support 16: Gaming The System,"Last time on Database Support: [If at first you don't succeed....](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/a3yejh/database_support_15_taking_their_own_suite_time)

---

I was not always the jaded and cynical database developer portrayed in my tales here, dear readers.  No, at one time I was an innocent and optimistic CS major who had never heard of design patterns, source control, or anything else the software industry had been up to in the past decade.  Hoping to get some real-world experience, midway through my junior year of college I went looking for an internship to see how ""real programming"" worked.

I ended up interning for the federal government...and so, during my tenure there, I continued to hear nothing of design patterns, source control, or anything else the software industry had been up to in the past decade.  My two years as a ThreeLetterAgency (TLA) intern are the main reason why I'm not currently working in government or government consulting today.

When I walked into the TLA office on the first day of my internship, the first thing I did was meet my boss.

(Well, actually, the _first_ thing I did was amaze IT by being the only new hire in the past few months who'd managed to log into both their computer and their email on their own, despite the fact that every new hire's passwords for both were the same and were written on a sticky note on their desk; when one of them walked in to help me get set up only to find that I was already logged in and waiting for my boss to get into the office, he laughed in amazement and told me I was welcome in their office whenever I had some downtime.

So the second thing I did was go down and meet a bunch of IT guys, the third thing I did was facedesk at the displayed incompetence of my distinguished soon-to-be-colleagues, and the _fourth_ thing I did was meet my boss.)

This boss, henceforth SweetBoss, was a mid-level data analyst of some description in her mid-40s or so, and was a lovely lady with a cheery disposition and a constantly-full bowl of candy on her desk.  (If she'd been a few decades older, the term ""grandmotherly"" would fit her perfectly.)  The only problem was that she was functionally computer illiterate, one of those types who had just enough basic proficiency with Outlook, Excel, and the like to do her job just fine...until a button moved or a desktop shortcut drifted even a pixel out of place, at which point she'd have a minor panic attack and would have to either ask IT to make things go back to the way they were or re-learn how to do things basically from scratch.

SweetBoss was assigned to be my mentor while I was there, despite knowing basically nothing about my job description, my prior experience, or really much of anything computer-related--in fact, she apparently wasn't even told she was going to have an intern until the Friday before I started.  So of course when I showed up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and asked what my main project for the summer would be, she was still scrambling to figure that out.

In order to buy some time, the first morning consisted of a very in-depth tour of the office and all the people in it, and whenever I met someone new she'd say

&gt; **SweetBoss:** Hi $name!  This is DB_Dev, he'll be our intern this summer!  You wouldn't happen to have any...computer-y things he could help you with, would you?

As the morning wore on, with no one having anything ""computer-y"" for me to work on, a tone of desperation crept into her voice every time she asked that question.  Fortunately for her, shortly before lunch someone reminded her of a certain project that their first intern had worked on over the previous summer, and she perked right back up.

&gt; **SweetBoss:** Oh!  Of course!  Yes, that would be a great help, that always takes us so long.  
&gt; **SweetBoss:** DB_Dev, I'll take you down to the cafeteria, and once you're done with lunch come see me again, okay?

After sampling the finest cuisine the TLA cafeteria had to offer, I stopped by SweetBoss's office as requested.  SweetBoss wasn't there yet...but what _was_ there was a massive stack of paper sitting on her desk consisting of at least a few hundred sheets covered in what appeared to be dense TLA jargon in a tiny font, and a quick flip-through revealed that these pages were all double-sided and freshly-printed.  I was still eyeing the stack with concern when she walked in, took her seat, and patted the stack with a big smile on her face.

&gt; **SweetBoss:** This is going to be your project for the next month or so!  
&gt; **Me:** Okay.  What is it, exactly?  
&gt; **SweetBoss:** This is our [redacted] document.  Every year, TLA updates its policies around [redacted] and issues a new document, and we have to go through and figure out what's been added, removed, or modified.  This is this year's document...  

She reached down to a box under her desk and strained to lift out another stack of papers just as large and plop it on the desk, followed by a handful of pens and highlighters.

&gt; **SweetBoss:** ...and this is last year's.  It'll be your job to go through this, find any changes, and type up a report outlining all of the differences for me by [deadline].  

Er.  What?

&gt; **Me:** And why did you print this all out for me?  
&gt; **SweetBoss:** Well, how else are you going to go through the documents and find all the differences?
&gt; **Me:** ...using...my computer?  
&gt; **SweetBoss:** Oh, no, you couldn't possibly.  If you try to open up both documents side-by-side they're much too small to read!  
&gt; **Me:** No, I mean, can't you just do some kind of automatic comparison?  
&gt; **SweetBoss:** What do you mean?  
&gt; **Me:** Doesn't whoever writes this document keep track of changes somewhere, and you could use that to generate the report you want?  I mean, why don't these people know what the differences are between two versions of the same document that they wrote themselves?  

It took a few minutes to explain the ""track changes"" feature of Word.  She'd never used it, and it sounded like the document writer(s) hadn't either, explaining why this was a task at all, so that was a no-go.

&gt; **Me:** Oooookay then, what about diffing the two documents somehow?  
&gt; **SweetBoss:** ""Diffing""?  
&gt; **Me:** ...never mind.  Could you email me the electronic versions anyway, and I'll see if I can do anything with them?  
&gt; **SweetBoss:** *sounding highly skeptical* Well, all right...but don't take too long with that.  You'll want to get started on reading through them soon if you're going to get it done in time.  

I walked back to my desk, regretting this whole internship thing already, and waited for her email.  When it arrived, she hadn't send me the documents as attachments; instead, she'd forwarded me a set of long and convoluted instructions for finding the documents on a shared drive.  I accessed the drive, found the documents, and took a look...and they weren't Word documents, or even text PDFs, they were PDFs of _scanned copies of printed documents_.  So I went back to her office.

&gt; **Me:** Sorry, you pointed me to some copies of the documents, could you show me where the originals are?  
&gt; **SweetBoss:** Oh, I don't have access to the originals, those copies are what we all use.  

I took a closer look at the actual contents of the stack of papers, and sure enough the text had all the artifacts you'd expect if you printed something, scanned it, and printed it again.  Oy vey.

&gt; **Me:** Could we possibly get access to the originals somehow?  
&gt; **SweetBoss:** Well...  
&gt; **SweetBoss:** *roundabout explanation basically amounting to ""nope, that's just How Things Are Done around here""*  

So I went back to my desk, opened up the scanned documents on the screen, and stared at them for a bit.  Each of them ended up being 900-some pages long--and they were double-sided, remember, so actually 1800-some pages on the computer--and I wasn't about to spend multiple weeks of busywork going through them manually, so I started pondering how to attack the problem in an automated way.

Unfortunately, the desktop I was issued was an old, clunky, heavily-locked-down XP image (this was back when XP was still supported, don't worry, things weren't quite _that_ bad), so I was quite limited in the tools I had at my disposal.  And I'd used Linux as my primary OS since high school, so even if I could have installed anything on that computer I didn't know any Windows programs that might help, or even any Windows IDEs to use to hack some code together to do something.

Waaaait a minute.

Linux?

Hmmm.

I happened to carry a Linux live USB on my keychain (still do, now with multiple distros), so I plugged it in, rebooted the computer, and was presented with the login screen for the live Linux image.  Seems TLA IT didn't think to prevent booting from USB,  fortunately.  Okay, good, I could work with that.

Then I had an even better idea.

See, one of my major hobbies was (and still is) tabletop roleplaying games, and as any RPG fans out there probably know, totally-legit-and-not-at-all-pirated copies of sourcebooks tend to make their way online in the form of PDF scans of the physical books.  Being a broke college student, I'd made good use of these PDFs for running campaigns over the past few semesters, but they were a pain to use during play because they rarely came bookmarked, you couldn't search them since the pages were just scanned images, and so on.  For my Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaigns in particular I'd wanted to create a nice searchable index of all the available races, classes, spells, and so forth from all the books I had access to, but wasn't about to go through and type them out myself.

So I'd tackled that problem in my free time a year before.  I'd found some OCR software for Linux and converted all of these scanned PDFs into versions with embedded text (not at all pretty formatting-wise, but accurate and searchable), used the very handy `pdf2html` program to convert them into a series of HTML pages that could be more easily manipulated programmatically, and written some Perl scripts to parse these pages and turn them from a disjointed two-column representation littered with extraneous HTML tags into nice, clean plain-text output with appropriate formatting.

And I'd suddenly realized that, wouldn't you know it, the policy documents I was supposed to work with were in the same two-columns-with-section-headers format as the D&amp;D books for which I'd written my scripts.

&gt; **Me:** Hey, SweetBoss?  There's no official policy against downloading or running outside software on our computers, right?  Stuff that doesn't come with it by default?  
&gt; **SweetBoss:** You mean like a program to let you read those two documents side-by-side better?  
&gt; **Me:** ...for example, sure.  
&gt; **SweetBoss:** Not that I know of.  The computer people have disabled anything we're not supposed to be able to do, so anything that works should be fine to use!  

A terrifying philosophy from an IT security perspective, certainly, but perfect for what I wanted to do.

I went home that night and loaded up my scripts and the OCR software on my USB.  The next morning, I loaded up the live image again, OCR'd the first page of each document as test cases, and spent some time running the parsing scripts against those and tweaking them to account for the documents' different format.

Once I was satisfied that the process would work for those documents, I started the OCR program running on the full documents while I wrote some additional scripts to take the outputs of the runs against the old and new documents, compare the outputs, and spit the results out in a fancy format with the verbiage that SweetBoss wanted.

I came back from lunch to two freshly-OCR'd documents.  Five minutes later, I had a 20-some-page report on every difference between the two.  Five minutes after that, I'd copy-pasted it into Word, added bolding and headers and such, and was done with my month-long project in less than four hours total.

Of course, I knew better than to turn it in immediately lest I be saddled with additional busywork that wouldn't be quite so easy to script away, so for the next three weeks I spent half my time going around the office getting to know the other employees better, finding out more about their day jobs, helping them with some basic IT stuff while I was there, and other networking and career-advancing sorts of things--making the excuse to SweetBoss that I needed regular breaks from reading through those very dense and technical documents--and the rest of my time in my office, supposedly hard at work on the policy report while I actually worked on other small projects both internship-related and non-.

I turned in my report a full week before the stated deadline, greatly impressing SweetBoss.

&gt; **SweetBoss:** My goodness, DB_Dev, that's the fastest anyone's ever finished that.  And no typos or formatting problems, either!  
&gt; **SweetBoss:** Our intern last year took five weeks to finish this, and his report wasn't laid out nearly so nicely!  
&gt; **Me:** What can I say?  I'm a fast reader.  

SweetBoss hadn't expected me to beat the deadline by that much and so hadn't lined up a second project for me to work on yet, but fortunately in my time chatting with the other employees I'd found someone who had another idea for a project and had already started on that, and when I mentioned that to SweetBoss (phrasing it as ""I want to work on this next"" instead of ""I've been working on this on and off for the past two weeks already,"" obviously) she was more than happy to pawn me off on someone else who had a better idea of what to do with me.

The next Monday, I headed down to that other employee's office, confident that I was done with file-conversion hackery for the rest of the summer.

holtenberg,"The projector hasn't been working for a few months, why isn't it fixed?","Typical day at the school as the IT guy. This happened a couple months ago but got reminded of this story when I read something similar on here.

I got an email that read something along the lines of ""the projector hasn't been working for a couple of months, why have you not fixed it?"". Along with it being mailed to me, she put my boss as a copy.

My colleague is first on scene. She starts the projector and it starts normally. We hook up the HDMI cable to her computer and get no image and not on mine either. We check sources, nope it's on HDMI 1. Check on the back of projector, nope HDMI 1. We check all the possible settings that could have been changed. Nothing wrong.

Our classrooms are equipped with wall mounted sockets angled downwards to put less strain on the cable I'm guessing. HDMI and Ethernet. We both bend over to check the socket out and we see the problem. They have JAMMED the HDMI cable into the Ethernet port. The Ethernet socket itself had come loose from it's bracket. We pull the HDMI cable out and plug it into the HDMI socket, boom picture.

Gambatte,Encyclopædia Moronica: T is for Three Little Words,"Two years ago:

&gt; ME: Ma'am, I understand your reluctance to shut down in the middle of the day, but we need to install the updated controller or else your controller will no longer be compatible with the new software.

&gt; Site Manager (SM): No! You come back tonight, and do it after hours!

&gt; ME: That's fine, we can arrange a time to do it after hours. However, I'll need to get sign off from the project manager for the over time.

---

One month later:

&gt; Project Manager (PM): I've submitted an updated quote to SM with the new rate for after hours work, but she is refusing to sign off on it.

&gt; ME: Let me know when she does - I've got no issue with doing the work, but we've got to get paid for it, right?

&gt; PM: Exactly.

---
---

One year ago:

&gt; ME: Okay ma'am, I've finished measuring up for the new screen to go in - I'll pass these to PM and he'll send you a quote. Once you've signed off on the quote, I can come back and install it for you.

&gt; SM: Good! Better not be too expensive.

&gt; ME: I've got no say in the rates that PM bills us out for; that's completely out of my control.  
Speaking of PM, I don't recall ever installing that updated controller. Did PM ever get that quote to you?

&gt; SM: No! Too expensive! You, you leave now!

&gt; ME: ... As you wish. May the rest of your day be as pleasant as you are.

---

Three weeks ago:

&gt; PM: Gambatte...

&gt; ME: I dislike this conversation already - you only say my name like that when you want me to do something I don't want to do. What's up?

&gt; PM: You remember SM?

&gt; ME: Remember her? Let's see... Short, middle-aged Indian or Pakistani woman, heavy accent, aggressive attitude? Barred *{a co-worker}* from her site for reporting unsafe work practices, impugned the work ethics of myself and *{my co-worker}*, got her site put on permanent stop credit with *{sister company}*, got herself blacklisted by *{major company we work with regularly}*, and is permanently at war with her neighbour over who owns what parts of the shared concrete parking lot outside their respective front doors, resulting in arguments if not outright fistfights whenever she wants us to install something outside - and she once called me out at 6 A.M. because ""the site was down"" because they overloaded the single wall socket in the main office that they run *{all of the critical equipment}* from on daisy-chained power strips¹ - then tried to cancel the call when I was in the parking lot so she wouldn't get billed for it!

---

¹ Tripped breakers are absolutely outside our area of responsibility, and thus the call was chargeable at entirely unreasonable after hours rates.  

---

&gt; ME: So yes, yes, I think you could say that I remember her!

&gt; PM: Ah. Well... She needs help.

&gt; ME: Excuse me one second.

*(incapacitated due to Hideous Laughter)*

&gt; ME: I'm back. What's going on?

&gt; PM: She ordered some new equipment.

&gt; ME: Didn't we already cover the ""stop credit"" thing?

&gt; PM: Yeah. So she ordered them from someone else, and got them to install it.

&gt; ME: Okay, I'm with you so far.

&gt; PM: But the new equipment uses a different protocol, so she needs a new protocol converter installed in her controller. But-

&gt; ME: Don't tell me - the new converter isn't compatible with her old controller and now she URGENTLY needs the upgrade she's been stonewalling for the last two years?

&gt; PM: Pretty much.

&gt; ME: Excuse me.

*(Hideous Laughter returns)*

&gt; ME: Okay, I'm back, I'm back.

&gt; PM: The catch is that SM wants the old equipment to run alongside the new stuff.

&gt; ME: Right, so we need to install the new converter, in parallel with the old one, in the new controller.

&gt; PM: Pretty much.

&gt; ME: That's not hard. All going to plan, it'll take me five minutes to do the hardware side of things, but you'll need to check with the Implementation Team on how long the software will take. If it was just a straight swap, I'd say half an hour, but setting up the new equipment on the new protocol might take longer, so best to ask them directly.

&gt; PM: I'll give them a call now - talk to you later!

And so the call ended. I set about locating the appropriate converter board and the new controller; while the controller was in stock, the converter board was a rarer beast, so I had to get one shipped in.  
The following day, all parts in hand, I headed out to the site to once more do battle with the dragon lady that is SM.

I composed a short speech in my head:

&gt; `T`hank you for agreeing to meet today.  
&gt; `O`bsolete equipment, such as you have installed, will not work with your new systems.  
&gt; `L`uckily, I have been able to procure updated equipment at short notice.  
&gt; `D`on't worry, it is under control!  
&gt; `Y`esterday, I was informed of your issues by PM.  
&gt; `O`btaining these parts immediately became my highest priority.  
&gt; `U`ntil they are installed, none of the new systems will work.  
&gt; `S`hortly, I will shutdown the whole site for a few minutes to replace the controller.  
&gt; `O`nce the new controller is configured, and connected, the new systems should be able to communicate correctly.

Yeah, that'll work...

---
---

Unfortunately, the Implementation Team let me down - the first one (I1) was great, but some work was left for a second tech to do overnight (I2). I2, however, misinterpreted the instructions, and called me back to site after hours to try to determine why some of the new equipment wasn't working (hint: it was neither connected, nor powered on). I1 did eventually get involved again, despite the late hour, and a semblance of sanity returned.  
I did return to the site in the following days, as the new systems continued to fail to communicate with the new controller. Unfortunately, it seemed that the only person with the desire to see this fixed was me, despite it falling entirely outside the realm of my responsibility... I eventually determined that the third party installers had incorrectly configured the new systems. On the plus side, I did learn a bit about the systems that they installed there, so it wasn't a total loss - and I'm certain that PM ensured that my learning experience was billed to SM at an extremely unreasonable rate. Whether SM was able to recover that cost from the third party installers who incorrectly configured the system is a question which I have no desire to learn the answer to.

ShiftyDankTank,"We tried to help an old lady, she brought in her lawyer...","Older story. Been debating posting this for awhile.

A couple of years ago, I worked for a small computer store in the city, we also offered repair services, and we were pretty well known in the area. One of our regulars, an older lady in her 70s comes in one day complaining about not having video from her computer. It works perfect when we try, so she brings in her monitor. That's when we get no picture like she had described.

So, at this point, we know that the issue is not with the computer itself. So, we hook her monitor up to an old PowerMac, and it works like a charm. The problem is that the adapter she uses to hook her PC to the monitor has died.

This is where things start getting hairy.

See, the monitor this old lady is using is an old Apple display that uses some old proprietary connector. Her computer is a Windows PC. That's where the adapter comes in. It converts the proprietary connection to a useable standard like VGA. This isn't the Apple DisplayPort either, it's older than that.

Just replace the adapter and you're done, right?

Unfortunately for her (and us) the only company left that made these adapters was either forced out of the market, or sued. I think it was the latter, I don't really remember. Point is, these adapters no longer exist for a reasonable price.

When we tell her this, the lady *freaks out!* I'm talking putting banshees to shame. She's shouting things like *""You promised to fix it!""* And *""Dirty liars!""* Like, lady, we can't get you something that isn't produced anymore, and is getting scalped on eBay for $300+.

Lucky for me, I'm in the back working a different repair. It's my poor boss who has to deal with her.

At this point, my boss tries to compromise by swapping her old Apple display for a new standard PC one that has the same screen in it.

For some reason, giving her an almost *free* monitor (albeit trading for her old one) makes her even angrier?! The whole thing ends when she pulls the *""I'll be back with my lawyer!""* line and walks out the door without her computer.

Believe me, I wish this story ended here, but no such luck.

Next day, I'm working inventory (you can see the front desk from the inventory room) when this old lady walks in followed by this spiffy looking dude in a suit and tie. Takes me a minute to put two and two together and figure out that *she actually came back with her friggin lawyer!*

My boss is actually mad now. At first he calmly explains the issue, and that he tried to work a compromise that worked *heavily* in her favor. But then a shouting match ensues after a comment that I couldn't hear.

Now I feel bad for her lawyer who looks like he already smells her bullshit, and is trying to wedge himself into an argument between a little old lady, and my boss who is a full head taller than him, and looks like death when he's mad.

What I do hear is the old lady saying *""I'm not threatening your business or anything.""* To which my boss responds *""You are the definition of a threat to business when you walk into an establishment with your lawyer!""*

A moment of silence...then *""Get out of my store.""* Fortunately, that was the last we heard of her. She and the lawyer walked out the door without another word (actually, the lawyer walked, that old lady stomped out).

She got to keep her useless monitor, but she never did pick up her computer. Because of our policy that is taped to the front desk, in several places, in plain view, and in a document with her signature, her computer became part of our stock because she didn't take it back within the 60 day period.

tl;dr- I'm at a client site playing the spare wheel at someone else's project summation/readout meeting. Ian seems to be involved somehow. Ian (a very special colleague) is also found a new way to be memorable and is currently standing behind me at the hotel bar.

me:""What are you doing here?""  
  
Ian:""I'm sarging. What are you doing?""

me:""I know the one from a past job.""  
  
Woman:""Colleagues?""  
  
me:""More like a cold that lingers on for so long you half get used to it and give it a name and origin story""  
  
She laughs and we have a meandering conversation while Recruiter and John finish up. I wander over to and we work out what each of us are doing. John will be presenting his findings and recommendations and I'll add ""color"" to them.  
  
We then use our remaining time to have a few more drinks on Client's expense.  
  
The next morning I regret that decision. The shower/suit/caffeine routine doesn't put a serious dent in my hangover. Recruiter and John are in somewhat better shape and we make our way to the Client offices.   
  
Clients' offices were the height of fashion, if Bennigan's in 1994 was fine dining. Lots of glossy wood, gold-tone recessed lighting and card table green paint.   
  
We make our way to a conference room that feels as luxurious as my high-school homeroom. I wait for a few minutes reviewing my notes while nursing a cup of coffee. Over the next ten minutes, a handful of people walk in:  
  
Russell: A back-slappy silver fox of a salesman. He's all smiles, but most of the other Client people seem to respect/fear him.  
  
Lynne: Client's director of IT. She's usually half focused on a tablet in front of her, as if the pot would boil but for her watching.  
  
Samantha:A younger woman who seems to take notes about everything. I think she's some kind of project manager.  
  
They're waiting for other people, but Samantha forces the proceedings to start close to time. John starts by diving into very specific technical detail, which I'll give you the exec summary:  
  
* Client's customers have legacy or obsolete systems that perform complex core business tasks, like payroll, medical billing or inventory management. These systems are expensive to change, update or move away from. 
  
* Client's customers operate in regulated markets so they have to do a lot of reporting, which changes on a regular basis. 
  
* Client has found an interesting niche. They take their customers' data, generate compliant reporting and spit it back to the customers for a profit.   
  
* Client is mining the tech debt of quite a few organizations who can't just rip out their old systems. Client isn't going to grow explosively, but they have a captive market.  
  
* Client's customers do occasionally remember that Client has a _lot_ of their sensitive data and puts their operations at risk should Client's systems go down.   
  
* Each Customer site has a Client supplied endpoint exposed to the Internet on one end with deep hooks into Customer legacy systems.  
  
I now return us to a painful readout. 
  
John:""We found over six of the endpoints that had older versions of your API""  
  
I'm searching through the report to see where he's at. He's decided to start in an appendix, not the executive summary.  
  
Russell is going from looking puzzled to annoyed.  
  
me:""Well, What John is saying is that we need to implement regular automated patching for all the endpoints""  
  
Lynne (looks up from her tablets):""We need to keep those endpoints compatible with our customers. We have to patch them by hand""  
  
  
John:""But you're at least twelve months behind on patching""  
  
Lynne:""we had different priorities""  
  
I hear a rustling and we have a new participant. Ian. He's better dressed than last night, but he's still Ian.  
  
Ian:""So, what are we talking about?""  
  
Russell smiles and introduces Ian to us as Client's new security engineer.   
  
We go back to our discussion.  
  
me:""We're confusing two things. The systems that support the customer facing APIs aren't patched. I get the APIs have to support the customer's output but how does upgrading the OS break the customer experience?""  
  
Lynne:""We've had some...""  
  
Ian(yelling):""It doesn't matter. The APIs themselves are secure. We tested them!""   
  
John:""The systems themselves are problematic. We kept locking up the test system with our scans""  
  
Ian(still yelling):""That doesn't mean anything. Who cares if an endpoint locks up!?""  
  
me:""Well, if it happens during a batch run, it might break an overnight process. That might result in unhappy customers""  
  
Ian(even more yelling):""But your testing broke the test system. You didn't test the production endpoints!!!""  
  
John (pointing at his laptop):""For good reason. You want us to test one and see if it falls over?""  
  
Lynne and Russell both shout ""NO!"" loud enough to make everyone but Ian jump. Ian rambles on about  for a minute until Russell shakes his shoulder.   
  
I see Russell and Lynne do that Leonidas and Gorgo head-nod thing. Lynne puts her tablet down and asks for a five minute break. Russell asks John and I if we want coffee.  
  
We wander out, leaving Ian with Samantha.  
  
Russell engages us with small talk about fishing and $local_sports_team as we walk to a kitchenette with a coffee maker that looks like it was liberated from a diner and the diner put up a fight.  
  
I'm trying to gently nudge past Lynne and Russell to get another cup of coffee in the futile hope that it'll get rid of my headache. Hangover + Ian is not the winning combination this morning.  
  
Lynne:""So, how do you think it's going?""  
  
John:""Well, you have a lot of work to do""  
  
Russell:""Can we make our customers happy by the end of the quarter?""  
  
Lynne:""We need more help""  
  
Russell:""We got you Ian""  
  
me:""I think Ian's a tool for a different kind of job. Lynne needs to reprioritize or bring in some IT help to clear the backlog on testing and patching. A contractor to do some of the other tasks will help""  
  
Russell:""I see. I think we have to do some internal discussion. Thank you for your report""  
  
Recruiter, John and I make our way back to the conference room. Ian is talking at Samantha.  
  
Ian:""Actually, I'm very intelligent. I have to hold back with most women""  
  
me:""Hey, Samantha. Looks like we're done here. Feel free to email with any questions. Ian, see you around""  
  
I get my bag and walk out to the parking lot. Recruiter is going to stick around and talk staffing things with Lynne for a minute, so John and I take a quiet Uber ride back to the hotel.   
  
As we get in the hotel elevator, John turns to me:  
  
John:""What's with that Ian guy?""  
  
me:""He doesn't have issues. He has the whole subscription""  
  
I take a nap for a few hours, then walk about the hotel for a distraction. I notice a few oddly dressed young men, similar to Ian and his friend from the night before. I follow them to a conference room, where it seems someone is setting up a seminar. I spend a minute looking at an easel describing the 'neurolinguistic seduction workshop' or something similar.  
  
One oddly dressed man sizes me up and saunters over with a grin.   
  
ODM:""Heyyyyyyyy. Are you interested in the seminar? You'll have to get some cooler threads if you want to channel all this power""  
  
ODM points at himself with his thumbs.  
  
me:""What do you charge for all this?""  
  
ODM smiles wider.   
  
ODM:""That's a question an Average Frustrated Chump would ask. What you should ask is if you're willing to change""  
  
me:""Good luck, man. I love your con""  
  
I flew home that evening with Recruiter and John. Recruiter told me that Client liked me enough to offer me a job, if I was willing to move. John got some sweet after-work and Ian was freed to take more pickup artist training.",talesfromtechsupport,1353,1571217065
DiadianDexe,Users are the enemy,"I went to help out at my boyfriend's non-profit the other day. He was rolling out new phones. I had the day off due to arbitrary holidays at my company and decided to bring him lunch.

scienceboyroy,There's been a fax-ident...,"Back in the spring of 2018, I had just finished creating an online submission system for the veterinary lab where I work. Previously, we would spend 2-3 hours a day on data entry, just deciphering and transcribing what our clients (generally veterinarians or their technicians) had written on the paper forms. For sample submissions that used our online form, however, we would just open the box, scan the barcode, and click the ""Accept"" button to import the data into our database. This would save us at least an hour or two each day, so I was pretty proud of it. In my ""free"" time over the course of about a year, I designed the online form, integrated it with FedEx Web Services, set up the database servers on the back end to handle the data, etc., and tested it extensively; now, it was finally ready for prime time.  I'm sure you can imagine my excitement.

The trouble is, it only works when our clients know to use it. I needed to get the word out. So I created a pretty neat little flyer extolling the virtues of our new online submission form (""Reduce human error!"" ""Print a FedEx label!""), and I queried our database to find the fax numbers of our hundred or so most active clients. 

Our database front-end client is Microsoft Access-based, so I wrote a VBA script to cycle through the client list and send each of them a copy of the flyer via fax. The code looked a little something like this: 

    'Create outgoing fax job.
    Dim objFaxDocument As Object
    Set objFaxDocument = CreateObject(""FaxComEx.FaxDocument"")
        
    While Not rst.EOF
        'Set properties of outgoing fax and submit it.
        With objFaxDocument
            .Recipients.Add rst.Fields(""Clinic_FAX""), rst.Fields(""Clinic_Name"")
            .Subject = ""Check out our new submission form!""
            .Body = Environ(""Temp"") &amp; ""\OnlineSubmissionFlyer.tif""
            .DocumentName = rst.Fields(""Clinic_Name"")
            .Submit """"
        End With
        rst.MoveNext
    End While

Because my phone line doubles as my fax line, and because it was Friday, I queued it up not long before I left for the weekend. I watched the first one to make sure they were sending properly, and everything looked good. They were still being generated, but for 100 faxes, that was going to take a few minutes. I wasn't sure how long it would take for all 100 of them to go through, but I didn't expect it to take more than a couple of hours.

Imagine my surprise when I walked in Monday morning to find that these faxes were still going out. 

More worryingly, we had several emails and voice messages begging us to stop sending them faxes.

Oops.

You've probably already seen my mistake, and now you're sitting there grinning about it. And that's all well and good for someone reading TFTS stories from the comfort of the employee restroom. But for anyone not familiar with VBA or the FaxComEx library, here's what happened: 

I created a recordset containing the recipient fax numbers. I created a fax document. I created a loop that adds a recipient fax to the fax document, sends the fax, and moves on to the next recipient fax number. What I did **not** have was a line that *removed* the recipient fax number. 

So the first fax went to the first recipient. The second fax went to the second recipient... *and* the first recipient. The third fax went to the third, second, and first recipients. And so on.

By Monday morning, the first recipient had received the same fax **71 times**. Each subsequent recipient had received it 1 less time than the previous recipient. 

Once I had stopped the remaining outgoing faxes, responded to all of the emails and voice mails, and corrected my code to send exactly 1 copy to each of the remaining 29 or so recipients, I composed an apology fax... and sent it only once this time. 

Honestly, I found the whole thing hilarious. Yeah, it was embarrassing, but inexplicably amusing. Fortunately, my boss had the reaction I was hoping for, and we laughed about it for a while. I still can't help but laugh about it every time I think about this ""fax-ident.""

Of course, the next fax-ident got the police involved... But that's a tale for another day.",talesfromtechsupport,723,1571110063
BushcraftHatchet,Monthly server reports,"So this is from about 15 years ago (before the implementation of LanSweeper or other such network infrastructure inventory apps). Corporate (turned out to be two idiots checking off a box) had the bright idea to send out a spreadsheet to all of its locations to fill out needed information on every server we had. Oh yes, I still think of these server reports every time I see the TPS reports in Office Space to this day. My personal area of responsibility had about 18 such machines on this list. The spreadsheet asked a lot of static information like amount of RAM and hard drive size. Then several things that changed almost daily like free space on data share, number of databases running and number of possible users (that is basically a guess). It was plain idiotic and time consuming.

Several months later all IT managers were meeting at corporate and the man who thought up this brain child excel report gave a 10 minute speech on the value of this information and then asked for questions. I raised my hand.

Me: ""So what good is it""

Speaker: ""What do you mean?""

Me: ""Well, this report is all well and good but honestly why do you need to know ... lets say ... how much free space is on my server? If it is full are you going to automatically ship me a bigger server or maybe bigger drives to install?""

Speaker: ""Well, no of course not.""

Me: ""Then I repeat. What good is it? Why do I need to spend my time filling out this information that will not create an action item to resolve any actual problem.""

This immediately spurred almost every manager there to speak out on their own problems with the report. Two weeks later it was removed from our responsibilities. I hate busy work.",talesfromtechsupport,801,1571087001
Noitpurroc,"Well, that was an early morning surprise.","First call of the day today, this lady got back from vacation and was having issues getting her computer to turn on. Apparently this issue isn't uncommon based on her explanation of why she doesn't shut the computer down very often.

Issue - Computer tower light comes on briefly for a second and then shuts right back off.  
Advice - Don't hold the power button; hit it and quit it.  
Result - Powers on without a problem. 

Bigger Problem: She's been doing this method of powering on her computer for some unknown length of time prior to today and never realized that she shouldn't hold the power button. \~shrug. 

Even though the main issue has been resolved, she requested I stay on the phone (as they all do) to 'verify it works' -- as if we didn't get further than she had before and already have a 200%+ productivity increase, but I'll amuse her.

Selben,Unbridled Rage,"**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**

 &amp;nbsp;

**$Selben:** Me! A Tier II ~~helldesk~~ helpdesk technician for a mid-sized company, with a very skeleton-crew helpdesk. 10 of us total for 24-hour coverage (not including supervisors) to support 2500+ company-wide.

**$Snickers:** My cubicle mate, a good friend, and also Tier II.

**$Enraged_user:** The star.

**$Sup2:** All around great supervisor. Worked his way up from the support line and understands how the helpdesk works.

&amp;nbsp;

$Selben and $Snickers shared a bag of cheesy crackers, while giggling at videos on the Internet, and enjoying the quiet hum of machines with the occasional click of a mouse. All was peaceful in the early morning hours until…

The door to the IT area burst open.

$Selben dared peek around the corner only to lock eyes with $Enraged_user who pointed his finger and walked straight at him. Without hesitation, $Snickers had retreated into a pile of emails, leaving $Selben to fend for himself.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; $Enraged_user: You! I need files moved to my flash drive!

He said this while shoving a personal drive at $Selben.

&gt; $Selben: I uh, sure… What files did you need moved?

He did not like the question, and angrily stomped his feet, checking over his shoulder.

&gt; $Enraged_user: Important company files!!!

$Selben’s eyebrow shot up at least an inch in pure confusion.

&gt; $Enraged_user: I’ll be back for those later!

He stormed off, leaving $Selben holding the flash drive.

&gt; $Snickers: Who was that?

&gt; $Selben: I… Don’t know?

&amp;nbsp;

Having no idea who the end user was or what they wanted, he left the flash drive untouched on his desk and went about his day. Around noon, $Snickers suggested they leave to get lunch. Upon their return, $Selben was caught on his way in by $Enraged_user, seemingly from nowhere…or possibly the bush by the door.

&amp;nbsp;

In a harsh whisper he spoke:

&gt; $Enraged_user: Where is the flash drive?!

He glared angrily.

&gt; $Selben: It’s on my desk. I wasn’t exactly sure…

He cut him off abruptly.

&gt; $Enraged_user: Bring it to me!

&gt; $Selben: Uh, okay?

&amp;nbsp;

The technicians passed through the doors, but $Enraged_user seemed to recoil like an invisible forcefield held them at bay (or he was avoiding cameras, $Selben later thought). $Selben retrieved the drive and headed back. As he reached for the door, $Sup2 walked in.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; $Sup2: Hey $Selben.

&gt; $Selben: Hello! Just giving this to $Enraged_user really quick, and I’ll get back on the phones.

&gt; $Sup2: Oh? What’s on it?

&gt; $Selben: Nothing. They wanted some files but didn’t tell me what was needed.

$Sup2 let out a sigh, turned and opened the door, while holding $Selben back gently with one hand.

&gt; $Sup2: Get out of here $Enraged_user. You have to leave company property. They let you go man.

$Enraged user began to shout and angrily stomp his feet. He pointed his finger with an evil, knowing grin.

&gt; $Enraged_user: You’ll never get any of the company emails to the vendors. I REFUSE to give you my password!!!

&gt; $Sup2: We’re IT. We already changed your password. We have all the emails, bud…
 
$Enraged_user screeched like some sort of animal and threw himself to the ground in the most epic display of pure rage $Selben had ever witnessed, far surpassing a four-year-old having a meltdown in a $Pizza_rat game room.

&amp;nbsp;

After about 30 minutes, police arrived, and $Enraged_user was trespassed from the property. He had worked at the company for 10 years, but apparently had been using his company card for MANY personal expenditures and was let go.

$Selben is unsure if $Enraged_user was ever made to repay the company.",talesfromtechsupport,1018,1570827729
japie06,Learning Swedish made me solve an unexpected problem,"I'm not technically tech support, but people see me code sometimes which makes me the 'computer guy'. Not a big deal really, most of my colleagues know how to use a computer.

Anyway. One of my co-workers came to me that she couldn't log in. I came over to her desk and she showed me that at the login screen different letters appeared than that she pressed on the keyboard. My first thought was that the keyboard locale/lay-out was set to a different language. I quickly checked the settings but it was set to correct layout. 

My colleague pressed some more letters and I noticed that when she pressed 'w' an 'å' appeared. I immediately looked at the right alt key and pressed it a couple of times. It came unstuck and now the correct letters showed on the screen.
  
""How did you know it was the right alt key that was stuck?"" My co-worker asked. A few years ago I learned myself some Swedish, mostly through online courses.

HelpMeAssistYou,Our daughter is friends with a ghost and it wants her to kill our newborn.,"Hello TFTS. First time posting. In honor of Halloween coming up, I thought I'd share the scariest tech support story I have. It's 100 percent true and is my favorite story to tell my end users around this time of year. I still get chills thinking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: It's early in my career and I've started working at a help desk. One of my friends is a nanny for a couple and she invites me to get coffee because she has a scary story and doesn't know who else to tell. Names have been changed.. aside from Rupert.

Me: HelpMeAssistYou

Lisa: Nanny and Friend

M: Mother of the children she cares for

D: Older daughter, 4 years old

NS: Newborn Son

R: Rupert a.k.a. the ghost

After getting our coffee we sit down.

Me: So, what's this story you have for me? You sounded pretty shaken up.

Lisa: Well, yesterday I was taking care of D and NS and D went down for her nap. When I walked by her room to check on her, she was singing, ""Blood, blood from the baby, it's okay he wanted to play. Blood blood from our mommy, that's okay she died today.""

Me: \*wide eyes\* What... the fuck?

Lisa: I KNOW. So, I sat her down and asked her where she learned that song and she said she learned it from her imaginary friend, Rupert. She said he talks to her sometimes and they sing together, mostly at night.

Me: That's insane. 

Lisa: I know, so I asked M about it and she said that D has been saying that for a while and that Rupert has been apparently trying to get her to get up in the middle of the night, go to NS's room and get him out of the crib to be in her room.

Me: How long has this been going on?

Lisa: Ever since they brought the baby home. There's no way she could have learned that unless someone told her. Her parents don't watch anything that would trigger that and she's very well sheltered. 

Me: \*After leaning back and thinking for a while\* Wait... Oh fuck.

Lisa: What?

Me: When they brought him home, did they buy new baby monitors?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes. That was it. We called the family and had them check it out. The monitors didn't record, but they could move and also have audio output. They waited until night, then stood outside the daughter's door until they heard a man talk over the monitors and start singing to her. Immediately, they unplugged them and called the police, but there was nothing that they could do to trace the guy. I walked them through two-step authentication on Nest units after that and Rupert hasn't come back. Fucking sickos, man.

OWD: obnoxious web dev

SA: ALL GLORY TO THE SYSADMIN

&amp;nbsp;

So we recently hired two new web developers, one of them sends in a ticket on like day 2, as follows:

OWD: Why are there these icons on my desktop? I don't want them there, I don't even use them! When I delete them they just come back! They're distracting and keeping me from doing my JOB!!!

SU: Those are a part of your department's group policy, just move them out of the way and ignore them if you don't use them. Closing ticket.

&amp;nbsp;

Time passes, my supervisor leaves and now I am the one who knocks

&amp;nbsp;

OWD: What the hell is ""group policy"" and how does it help me do my job! I want these icons gone! They're distracting!

Me: Hello OWD! *explains what group policy is in a friendly and helpful manner.* So unfortunately there's nothing I can do for you other than what SU suggested, however... If you'd like I can escalate to... the SYSTEM ADMIN. 

Now I am not normally such a petty man but the ""what the hell is gRoUp PoLIcY"" comment really sparked my ire for this unfortunate soul.

OWD: Yes, I would like that.

Me: *shrugs, moves ticket to sysadmin queue*

The sysadmin is a busy man and does not care to be bothered by such things. After a couple of days letting it marinate, OWD sends *another* ticket in for the same thing. SA sees it and instead of replying, he calls OWD.

SA: Hi OWD, would you be able to come to the IT office so we can discuss your, uh, tickets? Great, thanks.

(Just a minor note, but OWD is in a building across the street and about a block down the road, so he has to hoof it all the way here)

OWD goes into SA's office and the door shuts. I hear very little except for snippits of ""wasting our time"" and ""used by your department"" and ""move them out of the way"".

OWD comes out a few minutes later, head down, looking both upset and humbled, and quickly leaves.

SA: close his tickets, the issue is resolved.

I recently put in my notice and they decided not to replace me, so I'm training one of my coworkers to take over some of my workload. Like me, this coworker doesn't have a background in IT, but unlike me I don't think she's willing to put in the work and learn the minimal amount of things she needs to know to get by.

I've already told my manager (via email, cc'd to multiple people so my ass is covered) that I don't think she's a good fit and they should hire someone else for this role. They refuse to take my advice, but hey at least I get some funny stories for the internet.

Last week I walked this coworker through one of our processes: upload an excel file to our company website and generate various reports. It's really simple stuff but many employees struggle with this system so I wanted her to get familiar with it and all possible issues that might arise, since she will be tasked with helping users.

After I've shown her an example, I tell her to try creating an excel file and go through the process on her own. I leave for 5 minutes and when I come back she immediately calls me over and says it's not working.

Me: It's fine to take some time to figure it out, I'd rather you try to do it on your own first.

Coworker: No, I did it exactly as you showed me, come and have a look.

Me: Is there an error message? Maybe you can try figuring it out.

Coworker: I already tried 10 times and it's not working.

She insists until I go over and look at her computer screen. Immediately I see a red error message on the page that says ""maximum filesize (100MB) exceeded"".

Me: So, as it says here, the problem is that the file is too big.

Coworker: It's not possible, it can't be that big, I don't know its size but I'm sure it's much much smaller.

Me: Let's check the size of the file. \[We check. Looooong pause.\] I had no idea you could even make excel files that big... This file is 1.5GB...

Coworker: Yes like I said, it's smaller than 100!

Me: 1.5GB is... bigger than 100MB...

I get called up by the athletic director saying that an away team for our upcoming football the next day will have someone there wanting to use our network to live stream the game for fans back home. OK, kind of a pain but I can see what we have to work with. Called the guy up and eventually got in contact with someone from the streaming service, whitelisted a domain on the web filter and ensured a port was open for streaming on the firewall. Good enough right? I went on to also take a picture of the switch in the press box on the football field and I highlighted which ports to use if live streaming (other ports were reserved for other VLANs).


So $angryDude shows up to live stream and he tests it out, works great! Mission accomplished, I'm going to grab my kid and get some groceries, etc.... On the road he calls back and says nothing is working now. Ok great.... can you reboot? He refuses. I ask him to make sure the ports are plugged in correctly or if anything got unplugged on the switch to which he responds ""why would anyone unplug that important looking stuff?"".


So long story short, I drive back to the school and we eventually reboot his streaming encoder and things work. OK good. Going home, again....


After the game.... he unplugs everything including the power strip on his way out and I had to go back in and bring my gear back up the next day. smh

MrNotUnhappy,"Executive Assistant Says Someone Stole Her ""Oven""","This one happened a long time ago, but I still remember laughing pretty hard about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me = me, EA = boss's Executive Assistant

&amp;#x200B;

I used to provide support for a hedge fund. While the company had some big accounts, the office itself was pretty small (5 people). However, given the amount of money at stake, they couldn't afford to be down for a second, and they ran into plenty of (relatively minor) issues on a daily basis. That's why they needed a full time IT/tech support person.

&amp;#x200B;

When I started there, they had severely outdated machines and equipment. After the fund managers complained enough, I finally convinced the owner (a fight you to the death over a nickel kind of guy) to upgrade the workstations. The fund managers' machines were updated by a certain financial/news/software/data company which may have been started by a now former mayor because we had a contract with that company. The new contract included new(ish) machines for the fund guys. I also installed some extra memory we purchased on our own because 128 MB, seriously? Granted, this was Windows XP, but 128 MB was still just barely the recommended, and they couldn't open more than one Excel sheet while the financial data app was running. A minor purchase to upgrade to 512 MB, and the managers were pleased as could be.

&amp;#x200B;

Along with the new fund managers' machines, we ordered some workstations on the cheap for myself and the EA when the new tech was coming out. Gotta love those clearance sales. This was all done while the boss's EA was on vacation. I had moved over her accounts, files, etc., so she would have a seamless transition when she returned...or so I thought. When she got back, she called me over and started screaming that her oven was missing.

&amp;#x200B;

EA: My oven is gone! Put it back! I need it!

Me: What oven? We don't even have a kitchen in this office.

EA: My oven! The one I use to warm up my lunch!

Me (confused): I don't know what you are talking about.

Then she started pointing at the monitor and shouting, ""MY OVEN! MY OVEN! MY OVEN!""

&amp;#x200B;

I remembered how my cat liked to lay on my old monitor on my computer at home, and it finally dawned on me that she was referring to her old monitor. Along with the new workstations, we got new LCD monitors (as they were finally becoming affordable). She wanted her old CRT monitor back because it generated enough heat that she had been using it to warm up her lunch that she brought from home.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her the old equipment was gone, but she didn't like that answer. She made such a fuss that the boss came out to see what she was screaming about. When I explained the situation, he just rolled his eyes and walked off. He didn't even want to hear it.

Customer: ""Sorry, I'm just not really comfortable with handing out my phone number...""

smellykaka,Speaking to The Manager,"At a company I worked for more than 20 years ago, I would sometimes get customers who didn’t like what I told them, and demanded to speak to the manager. I’d transfer them, then a minute or two later he’d turn up at my workbench, ask me what the deal was, go back to the phone and tell the customer exactly what I’d told them, only now they’d be happy.

I imagine this is a near-universal experience for people who deal with customers in all sorts of industries, but one of my favourite customer interactions ever went a little differently.

I was on the phone with a customer (I no longer remember anything about him or what his issue was, other than probably broken hardware of some kind in his PC) and had been going round in circles for a while with him, thankfully in fairly civil fashion. Eventually I thought maybe inflicting the boss on him would help get him off my phone:

“Would you like to speak to The Manager?” I asked. 

After a pause, he said “No, no point”.

I’m thinking “huh?” and maybe this came across in the silence, because he followed up with:

“If you’re offering, you’re obviously confident that he’ll back you up . . .”",talesfromtechsupport,1774,1570268451
clark6050,How one smoke detector could have potentially killed 10 people.,"The story about how one smoke detector could have saved or potentiality killed 10 people.

I work as a tech at my local hospital, we have two offices that we work out of depending on what shift we're working (first shift works in the main office, second and third work out of our server room.) Being that it was a Saturday I was the only person in I.T there that day, so my office was completely empty except for me. As I'm doing my normal thing in our main office, like closing tickets and praying no one calls, I hear a ""code red"" get called over the intercom for the floor I'm on. Now, ""code red"" in our hospital means ""there's a fire, one person from each floor grab a fire extinguisher and get to that floor ASAP."" 

Our office takes up about half of the floor, the code red is called on the other side where all of the nurses are. Since there are 10 nurses working at a given time and I'm half a floor over I just ignore it and go back to what I'm doing. A minute or two passes and that ""code red"" gets updated to ""fire alert: Data Center."" At this point my head pops up like a meerkat and I let out a blood curdling ""HOLY SHIT!"" and I'm pretty sure I left a trail of visible light behind me as I cleared an entire floor in the matter of a few seconds. 

This was the case because I know that all nurse managers have a master key that can open up the doors to our server room. Now as I'm sure you are all aware, in a server room fire halon gas is released to suffocate the fire...and these ten people (who are unaware of this) are walking into this directly. 

As I make my way to the hallway where our server room is I see door shut behind the last person going in. 

I open up the door to hear if the halon sirens are going off...and thankfully they were silent. The halon gas didn't get released and there was no fire in our server room (thank god.)

What happened was that we had a contractor installing rafters above our servers incase the floor above us would flood, the rafters would drain the water away from the servers and save them. What the genious didn't do was clean off the top of the servers, there were chunks of ceiling tile and enough dust to turn the black servers white. Enough dust was kicked up by the moving air to set off a smoke detector and trigger the code red.

Our halon gas gets released when two smoke detctors are triggered. Only one was set off in this major blunder. 

It was at this point when my boss came in that we realized that we don't have any procedures for when we have a server fire. Also what you have to take into account is that these nurses aren't bringing halon fire extinguishers as well, so they wernt doing us any favors by trying to put it out...

So you guys decide, was it one smoke detector that saved 10 people or was it one that could have killed 10 people?",talesfromtechsupport,2232,1570189488
TheLightningCount1,Full Stop WTF answers that make me speechless.,"
We have all been there. You are trying to determine the cause of an issue so you ask various questions. Sometimes you get that one answer that just… so basic and technically the truth that you have to just stop and do a double take. “Did they just say that?” You almost feel like you hit a brick wall. 

This is just a small compilation of these tales. 

First one was a session that came in using the remote tool saying her internet doesn’t work. Now the remote tool requires the internet to work, so her internet was working. This one has a double wtf answer that caused me to just stand up and take a woosah moment. 

&gt; $ME – Hello! This is $me with IT. How may I assist?      
&gt; $User – My internet is not working.      
&gt; $Me – Well I see we are connecting on *remote tool* so it appears your internet is working. What are you trying to connect to that is failing?    
&gt; $User – The internet   
&gt; $Me – Riiiiight. What website are you trying to access?  
&gt; $User- The north Dakota housing website.     
&gt; $Me – OK go ahead and try to go there and I will take over. 

She goes there and the site fails to load. I copy paste the URL into my PC and it fails to load for me too. 

&gt; $Me – OK it looks like their website is down.   
&gt; $User – No… I don’t think so it’s a government website.    
&gt; $Me – Yeah that’s par for the course for a state website.   
&gt; $User – No it has to be my internet.     
&gt; $Me – Mam… we are currently connected over the internet.   
&gt; $User – No we are on my wifi.  

I just stared at my screen for a few seconds before I could respond. 

Second one was a printer issue that was not a printer issue. Ill explain. Guy was having issues with printer printing random numbers of copies of everything he printed. 

&gt; $Me  -  Thank you for calling IT this is $Me.     
&gt; $User – Hi this is $User. My printer is on the fritz again.   
&gt; $Me – OK what is it doing?  
&gt; User – When  I go to print is prints random numbers of copies.  
&gt; $me – How so? Like what do you mean by random numbers?  
&gt; $User – well first it printed 2 copies, then 7, and then tried to print 43.    
&gt; $Me – Yeah… that’s definitely random numbers… Where are you trying to print from?    
&gt; $User – My computer. 

I had to take a second for that to click and mute my mic to keep from saying “Uhhh dahoy.” Issue was he spilled coffee on the numpad part of his keyboard and it was firing off. 

Call comes in from a girl about her passwords not working. 

&gt; $Me – Thanks for calling this is $ME.    
&gt; $User – Hello My passwords are not working.     
&gt; $ME – OK are you getting an error message when you log in or does it say invalid username or pass?   
&gt; $User – Invalid  
&gt; $Me – OK, what are you trying to log into?    
&gt; $User – Everything.

bbsux,$3000 wasted,"I was a Custodian at a good sized School District and had slowly worked my way onto the day shift as an Supervisor.

I was tech savy and people would generally ask me to help them with computers (except macs, never owned one).  I had a good working knowledge of audio/visual as well, so I was tasked with setting up the technology for most of the meetings/gatherings etc.

Every single classroom had these 20 year old CRT televisions that were mounted to the wall.  They were ""industrial or institution"" models.  All they had on the back were BNC connectors and a RF input.  (Most people know that BNC is just a RCA jack that is designed to lock into place to be tamper proof)

They had bought all these new DVD players and wanted to connect them.  So the ""official Tech/AV guy"" got a plan approved to buy RF converters (Basically turns the RCA Output of the DVD into a signal on the coax Channel 3 or 4).  Now with 80 TV's that runs into some money!

Each RF converter (I don't know where they ordered them) cost them $15!

When The order was delivered on the dock I went directly to the Principal and got the info.  I informed her that we could buy RCA to BNC adapters for $.50 each (so each TV would cost $1.50).

So AV guys plan = 80\*15= $1200

My plan = 80\*1.50 = $120

The AV Guy refused to even consider that it would work -- Swore up and down that BNC was a nonstandard format and was useless for this.  I asked the Principal to not open the converters for a day.

I drove to Radio Shack (I'm old, Huh LOL) and bought 3 BNC-RCA adapters.  ($3)

The next day I pulled the principal vice principal into a classroom and had them watch me hook up a dvd player.  The AV guy was pissed off (I'm pretty sure that he was pissed cause I'm just a janitor and not only that -- he didn't think of it!)

It worked perfectly.  That AV guy thought it was fluke -- he pulled it off and we moved to another room and he hooked it up - Because you're just a janitor.  Guess what it worked there too.

I explained the differences (or lack thereof) of RCA vs BNC (same analog signal, with a tamperproof connector) to the AV guy and he reluctantly said my idea would work.

He still wanted to use the RF Converters.  The principals backed me up and returned the converters.

I had to fight that AV guy everytime I needed to setup something from then on -- until he got fired for destroying a $30,000 server. Idiot had a pepsi can tip over onto it while he was re-cabling!

rhunter1980,I don't care if it's on FIRE! It's a minor problem,"Long time stalker first post so here goes.
This will be a bit long so I can give you some background into this story.

TD:LR at bottom


I was a service tech for 15 years, pretty much anything in an office (computers, printers, copiers, typewriters, camera systems, etc.) but was not formally trained in the field when I first started. I originally went to school for electronics and computers so I had some trouble shooting skills. This tale is of when I went on my first solo call after 3 months of training. I got a LOT more stories so I'll see how this goes and go from there.


When I was hired I was trained as an office equipment tech for mostly copiers, printers, and faxes. I went for ride along with two senior techs for three months to learn the ropes, depending on what we were looking at I'd be with either one. Chris was my main boss, he was a bit of a sales guy but mostly tech. He showed me the ropes and how to make suggestions based from a service stand point, if something could work better for a customers needs by suggesting upgrades or another piece of equipment to handle any issues they were having. 


Now the other tech Scott was a no nonsense, let's get this stuff fixed and move on kind of guy. The first thing he told me and constantly repeated before a call was ""When talking to the about the equipment's issues it's always a minor problem, no matter what the customer says it's a minor problem. I don't care if it's on fire, it's ALWAYS a minor problem."" His reasoning for this was to try and de-escalate any issues they may be having so the customer would hopefully calm down thinking we'd have it fixed in no time. After 15 years I'd say 7/10 issues really are just minor problems, but not this one.


My first solo call was to go on site and replace a belt on an old dot matrix printer (the old ream feed, normally used for reports printer). The customer called in saying the belt that drove the print head busted and they just wanted to order a new one and have it installed once it came in, no initial diagnosis was done by us, its what they wanted. Ok, we order the part and once it comes in my trainers say this will be a good first call to do solo, just a part replacement and cleaning should be easy.



Cue deer in headlights and stomach in throat montage. I get on sight and thankfully the printers in a fairly accessible location with a nice big counter for me to work on it. I tear this printer apart, vacuum, blow, and wipe probably 10+ years of dust and crap out of it. Oil up all the shafts and bits that need it. Replace the belt and pop everything back together, not to hard. Now comes the moment of truth, time to test it. I had one of the office girls send a print job to make sure everything is working and it rolls into action. It's sailing back and forth looking like new and I breath a sigh of relief thinking all is well. That is until the printer gets about four pages spit out the back when all of a sudden the print head stops mid stride and a horrible grinding sound is heard coming from the printer, followed by a flame about 5-6 inches coming straight out the top of the printer. Que me scrambling like a madman to unplug everything from it and make sure the paper doesn't catch on fire. Thank the tech overlords the paper was feeding out the back and I didn't have the top cover shut entirely so I could watch it work. I'm standing there mouth agape and my body soulless, WHAT DID I DO!!! The office girls half snickering half dumb founded and standing behind them is the OWNER OF THE COMPANY!!! Cut to internal monologue of ""Well, I'm dead and fired"". He just saw this whole thing, flames and all and all he does is go ""Huh, cool!"" and proceeds to walk away into his office. I somehow manage to say Scotts line of ""Don't worry, just a minor problem. I'm sure we can fix it"" and I excuse myself so I can go outside and make a phone call.


I ring Chris and Scott, they were normally together when we were slow, and I get ahold of Chris. This is what followed:  
Chris: Yeah, what's up, everything going ok.  
Me: No, not really I had a bit of a minor problem. The um, the printer caught on fire.  
*insert a good minute long pause of dead silence*  
Chris: Come again? I don't think I heard you right.  
Me: I had a bit of a minor problem. The printer caught on fire.  
*insert another 30 second+ pause of silence*  
Chris: Ok, your on speaker Scott's here what EXACTLY has happened?  
Me: *insert above paragraph*  
At this point I can here Scott in the background dying from laughter.  
Chris: We'll what does the owner want us to do.  
Me: I don't know, I didn't ask. I figured I should call you for help, I'm screwed aren't I?  
Chris: Well that depends on what the owner wants to do. Offer to bring it back to the shop so we can look at it, no charge for anything so far. Find out and call me back.  


*Cue dead man walking scene from any prison movie*


I go back inside and head over to the owners office to see what he wanted to do. I explain that I can take it back to the shop and see if we can revive the charred corpse of his printer, no charge for anything so far.  
Owner: Na, just junk it, we've had that thing for ages. It was having issues where it'd just stop mid job for a while anyway. I was just looking up a newer model and it's not too expensive, we'll just replace it.  I'm amazed it didn't die sooner, cool how It caught on fire though. Can you scrap it for us?  
Me: *jaw on floor and stuttering to find words* Absolutely we can scrap it, If you want I can have my boss talk to you about the new printer he may be able to get you a deal.  
Owner: Sure, have him give me a call then.  
I proceed to pack up all my tools and the crispy printer in the van and start to head back to what I'm expecting to be a pink slip. Once on the road I call Chris and let him know what the owner said. He says everything is fine, head back to the shop and they'll meet me there later, bring the printer into the shop and see if I can figure out what happened.


Once back at the shop I took everything back apart and started trying to figure out what the heck happened to make this thing burst into flames. Turns out the print head had bad bushings that rode on the shafts going side to side and that caused it to seize up and wouldn't let the head move. My guess was that the because of the old belt it would just slip due to age and really crappy teeth in the rubber. The motor would keep running even though the printhead was stopped. Well put a brand new (tight, strong, new rubber teeth) belt into this equation and what you get is a motor trying to spin but not able to which caused it to overheat, which made the wires coming off it to get warm and that made the whisper thin coating melt. Once that coating melted the voltage wire hit frame and voltage grounded to frame makes for a VERY hot wire, that proceeded to burn about 4 inched along the bottom of the printer.


About an hour after I get back and am done messing with the printer Scott walks in grinning ear to ear.  
Scott: Where we going after work, I owe you a beer. You did good kid, It's always a minor problem. Something actually caught fire and you stayed true to my advice.  
Chris: Please don't make a habit out of this. But good job, you had crappy situation and you came out ok.  
I had them both take a look at the printer and see what they thought went wrong. They came to pretty much the same conclusion. I lived to try and ""fix"" something else another day.


TD:LR - Went out on first solo service call after being taught that all problems are a minor issue, even if somethings on fire. Actually had what I was working on catch fire in front of business owner who thought it was ""Cool"". Then called techs that trained me to explain situation only to have one laugh, congratulate me, and offer to buy me a beer while other just shook his head.",talesfromtechsupport,1665,1569948853

FlickieHop,Who remembers the SVCHost.exe doomsday of 2010?,"Sorry if this isn't allowed. I read a recent story in another sub and the title reminded me of this.

Little backstory first. I was fresh out of college and working in a third party call center. We mostly did off the shelf software support (mostly Office, Lotus Notes, Photoshop, etc) but could also do some vba and other coding. We had many clients including a bunch of Fortune 500s and some that may piss off taxpayers if they were allowed to know we were outsourced (think city in state x hires us in state y). Most of the time we were not allowed to say we were outsourced, which bring up different stories for a different day. 

Anyways. My training is long over and I'm learning XLVBA to be bale to support it for clients. It's a cold day in the Midwestern us near a spooky lake on the northern border. April 2010. Suddenly hundreds and hundreds of customers are calling in because their computers are constantly rebooting. We all try the basics but soon word gets around that almost all of us are getting basically the same call in both of our locations. 

None of us know what is going on. We're remote so we can't exactly check hardware. We can't remote in due to constant reboots. Then our manager gets an email from McAfee. An update caused SVCHost.exe to be quarantined. They're working on a fix and tell us to  hold tight.

A couple hours later we get another email with a script we have to sideload on every machine. Only we didn't have any admin rights whatsoever. Every time a customer called we had to call their local admins and send them the script to push on their local machines. 

These calls lasted for 3 days. IIRC McAfee publicly stayed that only a small percentage of customers were affected. Based on the volume of calls to my company alone I assume the actual percentage was much much higher. 

I know some of you remember this. What was your experience like and if you didn't use the provided script how did you fix it?",talesfromtechsupport,1514,1569842013

Leading up to my vacation that started right after work on Friday I sent out two different emails to the whole company telling them I would be on vacation and only available for emergencies and please keep everything else until I return.

Three hours after I get home and start my vacation plans I get a call from one of the vice presidents. He had just bought a new phone on a whim and needed it setup with email and multi-factor authentication for applications we require it on. He needs this all done before Saturday afternoon because he has work that absolutely has to be done and he doesn't have his old phone anymore so he can't use that until I get back. Last time we set this up for him it took close to three hours because he refused to follow the directions I sent out and was mad I couldn't just remote into his phone and do it for him. I told him I'd send him the instructions as soon as I could get to a computer.

I sent him the instructions again (while very drunk) at 3 in the morning and he began texting immediately asking for more help. I fell asleep and woke up to texts ranging from 3 until 8 asking for help because he couldn't figure out my instructions. So now I've been talking to him for over two hours and loving this vacation.

NerdyGuyRanting,Tech support can be really helpful if you aren't rude to us,"Today I got a call from a user that needed the latest version of iTunes on his computer. But it wasn't available from our software store. He asked me if, since he had an admin PC, he could uninstall the iTunes from us and downloaded it on his own.

Here's the crux, we don't have support on admin PC's. But I figured a simple yes or no would be fine. I guessed the answer was yes, but to verify I told the user I would be right back and put him on hold. I walked over to our coaches and asked if my guess was correct. They said yes, *but* the lack of support to admin PC's goes so far that I can't tell him that.

I return to the user and inform him that sadly our support doesn't cover his PC, and it apparently goes so far that I can't answer this question.

The user sighs and asks if at least could help him uninstall the iTunes from our store, because he can't find the uninstall option in Software center (where all our software is found). I inform him that I am afraid I can't do that either.

User: ""So you can't help me get rid of a program *you* installed on my PC?""  
Me: ""Sadly, no.""

The user was quiet for a few seconds and then this conversation followed:  
User: ""... Say I was using *another PC*. How would I go about uninstalling a program?""  
Me: ""... Well... If you are using another PC I would tell you to open Control panel and go to uninstall programs. But this is *only* for other PC's of course. PC's that aren't admin PC's.""  
User: ""Of course. Of course. I would never do this on an admin PC. I am using this other PC next to it. I promise.""  
Me: ""Good. We wouldn't want to break the rules for the support.""  
User: ""Heavens, no. I would never ask you to do something like that.""

I then ended the call and split the call in to two cases. One for the iTunes thing where he was denied support. And a separate one where he asked my about how to uninstall a program on a nondescript computer.

I have been in similar situations before. Situations where I could have used some loophole to help a user. But the user had been so rude and unpleasant that I chose not to. So it was nice to talk to someone who understood that I didn't make the rules.",talesfromtechsupport,1884,1569630481
Booshminnie,How a desk phone took down an entire office,"This is my first story, though it happened a while ago. 

Me | client

Client: I'm calling about our entire office being down 
Me: has this just happened or is it an existing ticket?
Client: Just happened!
Me: ok so let's check the physical side of things - where are you now? (I start pinging the wan ip which is up)
Client: I'm in front of a desk phone that has a red x on it and something about no dhcp
Me: ok so I'm getting a response from your modem there so internet is working, might be something inbetween your computer and the modem. Can we go into the server room
Client: ok, btw, I came into setup 2 new users and I can't hang around. I've got 2 hours to do this in
Me: we're handling it
Client: I'm in the server room, what am I looking for
Me: judging from the site photos you should have some switches that connect all your computer's to the modem to get internet. Are the switches on?
Client: what are switches? Can you just send someone because the directors are starting to yell?
Me: I need to verify some things before my manager will send someone (I didn't mention call out fees but I did mention we don't have a pool of helpful garden gnomes that have nothing to do, because they're currently at client sites) I've sent you a photo circling the switches
Client: ok so now what
Me: are the switches on?
Client: yes

So we get her laptop plugged directly into each switch. One switch doesn't provide her laptop with the web bits

Me: ok this is the troublesome switch. Can you pull the power on it
Client: ok one sec

(In reality it took longer)

It's powered up and still no change. We unplugged some cables and plugged them back in and it felt like I was starting to burn time

Now I won't go into detail, but basically I was escalating, then that was getting escalated, all the while the customer is complaining about it not working, how they're freaking out... at one point they asked how they could work :

Me: you can make sure the printer is in a wall port that goes to the second...
Client: too hard. Can't you just get it to work
Me: *pause* yep, just the way I told you. Or you can stand directly in front of the switch
Client: I'll stand, this couldn't have happened at a worse time

So I'm getting push back from my escalation point, being asked questions like ""have they messed with anything on the switch"", and checking the trunk ports between switches... all valid but still frustrating when I'm trying to placate a site contact.

While my tech manager is getting ready to go, I'm asking some last ditch questions like ""So when you setup the new users at their desks what did you plug/unplug"" and as she's going around having a fiddle, stuff starts coming back online

I put the on-site visit on hold, tell my manager, and I'm going through the checks when my manager busts into the call and asks what she unplugged

""The phone""

Manager: ok you'd plugged one phone into two wall ports. The port with the computer goes to the computer and the other port goes into the wall

DexRei,Headphones don't work when you don't wear them,"Small backstory. My team at work provides telephony services to customers. This particular customer has multiple departments.

I get a ticket at the start of the week. User from Department1 is having issues with reaching Department2. Every time they call, their calls go 'straight to voicemail'. I check the logs and the routing, and find that calls are actually targetting a user in Department2 and ringing for 15 seconds before diverting to voicemail as they are going unanswered. I recheck this with User1 and they confirm that there is ringing when they call, but User2 says they get no ringing on their own end.

I follow up with User2 and gather the logs from their own phone. Sure enough, there's the call attempts coming. Based on the logs, the calls come in, trigger a pop up on the user's screen, and ring for 15 seconds before diverting to voicemail. The following conversation happens:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hey User2, we are still looking into this issue with calls not ringing on your end

User2: Hey Me, yes I don't get any ringing at all.

Me: Well, one thing I want to check. Your phone logs say you have a headset, do you?

User2: Yes I do.

Me: OK, does the sound for your phone normally go through that?

User2: Yes it does. When I am on calls, I use the headset.

Me: And you don't hear the ringing coming through the headset?

User2: Well I do sometimes. I sometimes have the headset on and a call comes in, and I can hear the ringing in them.

Me \*sometimes have the headset on, so you don't hear anything through the headset when you don't have them on?\* : Just to clarify User2, you don't wear your headset all the time?

User2: Well no, I usually have them on the charger stand behind my monitor.

Me: OK User2, it looks like all the sound for your phone comes through your headset. You can't hear the ringing, because you don't have your headphones on.

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently looking into the desktop settings and application settings (there's a PC app that controls the phone) to see if the ringing can be separated from the rest of the audio and played through the computer speakers, or the phone itself. 

TLDR: Turns out that you can't hear sound through your headphones when you aren't wearing them.",talesfromtechsupport,774,1569542349
jimmy_three_shoes,$300 well spent,"I work as a tech in ""higher"" education.  Dealing with Faculty on the regular can be somewhat frustrating at times, but this one was a real head-scratcher.

Last summer, we moved the Humanities department from one building to another due to a renovation.  After the reno was finished, and we moved these instructors back to their new offices.  One of them threw a ticket in claiming we ""Switched her new Compaq computer with an old Dell computer"" and provided pictures to ""prove"" it.

First of all, we stopped deploying Compaqs/HPs in 2010, when we made the jump to Windows 7 coupled with an OEM switch.  Secondly, the asset tags in both of her before and after photos matched.  

She also refuses us entry into her office if she's not there, but refuses to come in before 7:00 PM, when IT goes home at 6. We tried to point out that the computer was not swapped, pointed to the mass move spreadsheet her Dean put together for the renovation with the Asset # on it, that matched her photos.  The ONLY difference was that because her new desk was smaller, we had to lay the computer horizontally with the monitor sitting on top, rather than standing vertically next to the monitor.  She also claimed we swapped out her monitor, keyboard, and external speakers with ""old, antiquated models from the 1990's"".  Even though you can clearly see that they all matched in her B/A photos.  She ignored our email for two weeks, and we close the ticket due to no response.  This resulted in a SCATHING email asking us why we refuse to bring back her old computer, and how can we justify taking taxpayer money for our salaries.

So I get permission to work an hour OT to meet this woman and figure out WTF she's on about.  Before I left, I printed out the signout sheet she signed when we gave her the computer in 2015, with the Make/Model and Serial of the computer she had signed out.  

I get to her office, and show her that EVERYTHING MATCHES.  The asset tags in the photos, the serial numbers match with her entry in our inventory, as well as the computer sign-out sheet THAT SHE SIGNED when the computer was originally deployed to her office.  I ask her if she's missing files, or if her desktop doesn't look right when she logs in. 

NOPE. 

Apparently when we were moving 20+ faculty after-hours in one night, we also had time to export and import her profile and all her files onto this ""old"" computer.

I said ""I don't know what else to tell you.  This is the computer you had before the renovation.""   
She tells me to get out of her office and she'll ""Make do with this garbage we gave her"".

I got back to my office, document EVERYTHING. Included a few pictures I took when I was in her office on the ticket for posterity, and closed it.  Gave my boss a heads up (the woman has attempted to grieve IT in the past for self-inflicted wounds), and had a laugh over a beer later.  

A few months later, the computer in her office is due for a life-cycle upgrade. So we created a ticket asking her to start organizing her files so we can transfer them over at the time of the upgrade. We got an angry response from her saying she ""doesn't want anyone from IT near her office as we all conspired to gaslight her back in January, and continued correspondence attempts will be considered criminal harassment"". 

Kicked the ticket up to my manager, who contacted her Dean, along with copies of all her other tickets showing a complete refusal to work with IT whenever she has a problem.  The Dean was sympathetic to our plight, and told us she'd take care of it.  Got a response from the instructor a few days later saying that after speaking her Dean, she'd like to take advantage of the Technology Opt-Out program, in which the college pays her $300, tax-free, to provide and use her own equipment.  This also means she no longer will receive network resource access or printing capabilities, as we don't let non-college owned devices on the network.  **It also means we no longer have to support her.**  Additionally, if she doesn't provide the college with proof that she used that money to purchase a new computer within 3 months of receiving the funds, it's taxed as a bonus.

Everyone in my department agrees that $300 to get her to fuck off is money well spent.",talesfromtechsupport,804,1569523541

Me: No, I'm not calling to schedule a meeting but to explain that if we remove these boxes you won't be able to use the computers

DM: Do you think I'm Stupid?

Me: No, I'm just explaining that you won't be able to use your computer without the computer being connected to the screen

DM: What are you talking about? I don't look under my table to use the computer. Look you obviously don't know what you're talking about, I want to talk to someone who knows about IT. O I also want your first name and surname so that I can make a complaint!

Me:  My name is Me, I'm not giving you my surname for data protection and I do know what I'm talking about. Trust me, if you remove the actual computer, the box you are referring to you won't be able to use the computer.

DM: Watch the Space! *Slams the phone down!*

*I closed the job documenting everything. A week's gone by and we get an Emergency call-out, stating that none of their computers are working. We arrived to find all the computer towers have been cut free from their cages and removed.*

Me: What happened to all the towers?

DM: I told you to watch the space, I got a professional team to remove the boxes! See it is possible!

Me: No I don't see, now you can't use the computers!

DM: What a lot of nonsense, just get the internet working so that we can use the computers again!

Me: No, what happened to the computers?

DM: Are you stupid or something? They're here! *referring to the monitors*

vk6flab,Let me un-fix that for you,"Dave and I worked at a Helpdesk in the 90's. For reasons lost to time, I found myself in the car with him at the end of the day going home.

Dave was dropping by a client on the way to fix something that was broken. Not sure what the circumstances were exactly, but I stayed in the car and he went in to see what was up.

Comes back a couple of minutes later with a big grin on his face and tells me what happened.

Dave explains to the client that there is a minimum call-out fee of $100. Client agrees.

The client needs to have some setting fixed, something about a printer if memory serves me, so Dave opens up the Windows Control Panel, dives in 17 clicks later, problem fixed.

Dave says: ""All done, that will be $100 please.""

Client is unhappy that this little clicking exercise would cost $100 and says: ""I'm not paying for that.""

Dave says: ""No problem"", reopens the Windows Control Panel, 17 more clicks, problem un-fixed.

Lilyliciously,Words have no meaning,"This just happened and I just need to vent so sorry not sorry you're my victims.

A user calls in, saying that they have a package that their system is asking them to send to another site. That other site can't handle that type of parcel according to them, so something is wrong in the system.

Naturally, I check my system, and it says this other site does handle this type of package. Naturally, the user says no sites of that type handles that type of package.

The conversation gets more and more heated as the user gets pissed off and I try to deescalate, offering up a whole host of people that can help them with how the process works. After all, if the system says that site handles that type of package, it does, right?

I end up ending the call after getting their contact information because they're adamant that they're right and I'm wrong. I call around, talk to various people, who all agree with me that that site definitely handles that type of parcel. Finally, I get to the big boss of that entire flow, and ask her. She says that no sites of that type handle that parcel. I ask why the system says they do, which she finds weird and starts investigating. Then I get this gem.

DivineChaos91,Do you have any idea what that printer cost you?,"So I finally have a story that isn't too depressing to put on here. First a little background, I am field tech for a little Mom and Pop operation. I take care of everything from networking, to computer hardware. We mostly deal with small businesses, but occasionally I get stuck with a residential.

So it was like any other Wednesday morning, I woke up and checked my tickets. Saw that a residential had been assigned to my schedule, and looked at the notes. Saw that the customer was providing the parts, she just needed us to set it up for her. I sighed and bitched to myself before heading onsite.

Wednesday day morning I show up about a half hour early, I ring the customers doorbell... no answer. So I go and sit in the car, thinking maybe the customer wasnt home yet. When it was time for the schedule appointment I went and rang the door bell again. I got no response, so I decided to call the number on the ticket.

Divinechaos91: Hi, this is Divinechaos91with Mom and Pop Tech. I have you on schedule, and I was just seeing if you were available.

Customer: *angrly* I've been waiting for you! I'll come to the door to let you in.

I hang up the phone with her, and before she can come to the door, I get a call from the office. Apparently the customer, had called and complained that I was not there on time. Even though I had been waiting for her in my car to let me in. I explain what happened to the office, shrug it off before the customer comes to the door.

The customer brings me up to her daughters room, and tells me she needs this printer setup, that was brand new in the box.

Customer: So I want this setup to the wifi so everyone can print off of.

Divinechaos91: As long as the printer has the capability it shouldn't be a problem. Should only take me a little bit.

I start opening the box and the printer and find that its USB only. I apologize to the customer, and explain that it wouldn't be possible and it would have to print only from her daughters laptop when it was plugged in. She sighs, and tells me fine. It was about this time I started to realize this was a cheaper printer. I set everything up and find the printer didn't come with a USB cable.

Divinechaos91: Sorry, Customer it didnt come with a cable. Do you happen to have one?

Customer: *visibly upset* Well dont you have a USB cable for it?!?!?! You're suppose to be the tech.

I apologized, explained that my notes said she had told the office that she would provide the parts. She got upset and criticized me for not being prepared. I apologized again, I told her that our office was about 10 mins down the road, and I'd be right back. So after driving back to the office to get the USB cable, I went back and tested her printer... 

This where things start to get worse, and realize that the customer doesnt have a basic understanding of how any of this works. I setup the printer on her daughters laptop, I go to print out a test page and ask for some paper. She hands me an already used paper. That had appeared to come from her daughters school, already printed on one side. I shrugged and said it should be fine for a quick test print. I run the test page, and find the ink to be extremely faded. I ask her for another page, and run it again. I do this a few more times.

Divinechaos91: So it looks like the ink cartridges have dried up. How long have you had the printer?

Customer: 3 years

Divinechaos91 *shocked pichaku face* ( I cant for the life of me figure out why anyone be paying this kind of money for an old printer.)

Customer: why is that a problem?

I show her the test pages, and explain what is happening. I tell her I believe that her ink cartridges have dried up. Shes takes a shot at me asking if I was guessing or if I knew what I was talking about. I ignore her and check the price of ink cartridges. Shocker its ridiculous amount of money. I explain she would be better off buying a new printer with the features she wanted. That it would be cheaper than  replacing the ink cartridges. I help her pick out a 50 dollar hp all in one printer. 

Customer: Can your company order it for me, and can you come back out onsite to set it up?

Divinechaos91: *internally* ohhhh god why? ""Yes of course let me go ahead and get that ordered for you.

Customer: okay I'll make sure I get some printer paper before you come back.

Friday comes the customer is back on my schedule, the printer had come in everything seemed fine. I headed back onsite and this time just called her immediately instead of ringing her doorbell. She comes to the door.

Customer: ohhh I forgot to get printer paper, we can use some of the old paper to test it, after you set it up?

Divinechaos91: *internally* Why do I even try? "" Yes M'am that should be fine, just get some new paper as soon as you can.

So we do the same thing again, but this time it seems go a little smoother because it's the right kind of printer. I get it setup on the wifi, and setup AirPrint. We test again with her old used paper, it's looking a little wrinkly, but does okay. I explain to her that because we are only using one page, the printer is throwing a fit. So you have to hit the print button on the printer to get it to resume, but it should be fine after you put more than one page in it. We test all her apple devices, and laptop. She thanks me and I'm on my way.

This should be where this damn story ends. But fast forward to Monday, and I see her name pop back up on my schedule. I head back to her place, and shes all pissed off saying I sold her a lemon and going on and on. I apologize for the inconvenience and ask to look at it. 

She brings me back to the printer, and I see that it is asking for more paper...

Divinechaos91: hey do you happen to have anymore paper?

Customer: proceeds to hand me more of her daughters wrinkled worksheets.

The new printer has had enough of this shit,( and really so have I). And starts jamming and ripping the paper. I explain to the customer what's going on and she gets made that I sold her a cheap jamming printer... I smile and go I believe it's the paper. She continues to complain saying I'm a con man and I dont know what im doing. I smile and tell her I'll be right back. I am going to the office to grab a package of paper. 


I get back to the office and rant about residential customers, and head back to the customers with a full stack of paper. I clear the print jobs, fill the printer. I test print, and have the customer test. She appears to be happy with the product, I end up selling her the package of paper so she doesnt have to go to the store. I smile and shake her hand and head off to my next appointment.

So this my tale of the over $500 cheap printer install, sorry it was so long but I needed to rant on this one.

probablywhy,Storage is full.,"I work as a phone repair technician inside of a phone retail store. 

So this lady came in today with an older iPhone, and she wanted to switch over her data to her new iPhone 11. (we've done maybe 50 of these transfers in the last couple days,  it's a small part of what we usually do apart from repairs) This is business as usual, but she tells us that she's been in before and we know there must be something deeper going on making it difficult to transfer. She tells us her daughter had trouble with it and so did one of our coworkers who helped her yesterday. 

So we try 2 or 3 normal methods to transfer her data and nothing is working. Eventually we conclude it's because her storage is full. It won't allow cloud backup or installation of any transfer apps because it's so full. So we work with her to try to find something she can delete. 

Problem is her phone doesn't have any apps that are deletable. Only the default ones. Her looking at her storage reveals that it's all just photos. 

She was super specific she did not want to delete any of her photos because she had family that had passed away and they were very important to her so we didn't want to pry. We try very hard not to snoop peoples personal info and photo galleries but after an hour of trying to work around it, curiosity got the better of me.

She really did have a lot of photos. 28000+ to be specific. I clicked into one of the albums and I was astonished to find it was not photos of her grandchildren at all. The photos were almost entirely product images of jewelry. She saved so many that I was astonished. I looked over at my coworker and scrolled. And then I scrolled faster. And then I scrolled as fast as I could. Yep she had 28000 pictures of FUCKING JEWELRY. There were a few normal pictures scattered about sure, but the vast majority were JEWELRY! 

My coworker looked for another moment stunned. I started laughing. I couldn't contain it, I walked into the back and laughed harder. I was hysterical. We both were. We had to keep quiet because she was still standing at the desk on the other side of the door. It took a good 5 minutes before I was able to face the customer without cracking up.

""Maybe you could take a look at the photos and see if there's anything you can delete?"" As I handed the phone back to her. ""Just as much as you can, maybe that will free up enough space to work with.""

She comes back up to the desk 10 minutes later after deleting 30 photos. What... I imagine she probably went through and was like ""well I'm keeping the jewelry, might as well delete some of my least favorite grandkid""

Obviously 30 photos was not enough space. So we ended up telling her that she would need to delete probably another 100 or so before it would allow it to back up. So she decided to leave and come back later. She didn't even acknowledge the jewelry photos.

This whole interaction was so weird and insane that I am still laughing and scratching my head. What the hell?

Ivisi,The day I shut down an entire government agency,"So, a little backstory.  This was in '96-'97, and I had been working with this IT services company for only a few months.  We had two customers with large HP 9000 Unix mainframes, I remember at least one of them was about 5 feet tall.  In the back of those enclosures, you could swing open the door and mount rack equipment alongside expansion modules for the mainframe itself.  One of those customers used that space to store network switches and hubs in the rack section, and it was common for us to go into the back of those servers and make changes to network topology, service networking equipment, etc, while the server was still busy humming away.

We had other customers that had TI 1500 Unix servers.  The way these servers were described to me at the time was, quite literally, the ""little brother"" to the bigger HP 9000s.  The enclosures of the TIs looked nearly identical to the HPs, along with the back door that swung open and gave access to the expansion modules, only on a much smaller scale (and unable to store rack equipment like its big brother).

Now, I was not a Unix guy.  By this point, I had dabbled a bit with Linux, but was hired primarily for my knowledge of Windows desktop and NT, Novell, and various LAN and WAN technologies.  We also had Unix specialists on staff, and nearly every one of the companies we had contracts with had their own staff, as well, to take care of these machines.  Suffice it to say, I knew little to nothing on these machines themselves, as I was in the world of Pentium, Pentium Pro, Cyrix, and AMD.  Now, on to the day in question.

One of our clients was a county government agency.  This was a fairly large county, so there was a lot of IT infrastructure involved with their operation.  At this time, they were a Novell network on the PC side and were just introducing Windows NT machines into their server infrastructure, but they also utilized a single TI 1500 that served their main application via green screen terminals (either terminals themselves or via terminal emulation on PC).  We had just done some major changes to their network by deploying some new Windows NT servers and some new switches, and the owner of my company wanted us to go through the server room and the equipment closets and confirm and update our maps of the connections.  As an added bonus, he wanted us to tag the ends of cables with labels that said where that cable was plugged into at the other end.

So, I get there early one morning with a co-worker and set about doing just that.  We started with the equipment closet farthest away from the main server room and began working our way towards the center of their IT universe.  We get nearly all the way through the main server room, and are left with several cables going into the back of the TI 1500 enclosure.  So, we do what we've always done, pop open the back enclosure door and start tracing the network cables leading into the back of it.

We're about halfway done when the IT manager rushed into the room saying that all of the agency locations have crashed.  He walks up to the main terminal, and it's dead.  Passed on.  Ceased to be.  This is an ex-terminal.  He asked what we had been doing before it crashed.  So, we told him.

Turns out, the TI 1500 has a kill switch that shuts off power when you open the enclosure.  So, as we opened the back to map out those connections, we also managed to kill the power to the server and shut down the entire organization in the middle of the workday.  When he asked why we did that even after reading the warning, I said something to the effect of ""Warning?""

There, on the back door of the enclosure, was a large neon green sticker which said, in large print (and I'm paraphrasing from memory), ""DO NOT OPEN THIS ENCLOSURE WHILE THE SERVER IS POWERED ON.""

A few minutes later, everything was back up and running and no damage to equipment or data, so we were finally able to sit back and have a laugh about it.  Both myself and my co-worker are about to celebrate 23 years with the company, and we still have this government agency as a client, although about 10 years or so ago I moved to software development.

TL;DR:  I'm apparently a blind moron who can't read a giant neon green warning sticker.",talesfromtechsupport,628,1569081672

User: but we can’t fax from here. We need someone to fix the fax machines

Me; I can’t help you.  I support the London office, and I don’t know anything about New York and I’m not paid to be on call and you have your own IT support

User: But I called you because our fax machines don’t work.  Stop putting stuff in the way and get our fax machines fixed NOW!

Me: I’m 3000 miles away.  I don’t know your setup, and it’s so totally not in my remit i don’t know what to say.  It’s like calling a plumber in California for you.  I cannot help. 

User: if you don’t come and help me I’m going to get you fired! Do you know how serious this is?

Me; FUCK OFF!

The next day I rang his manager and was told that the guy in question had been disciplined, and got a full and frank apology from the divisional director for the whole affair, after I made a complaint. I also claimed an hours overtime.",talesfromtechsupport,2175,1569063985
Mecha_Ghost_Dragon,ID10T user kills computer with phone line,"So back before there was Cable Internet there was DSL, and before that there was Dial-up. I worked at a Dial-up ISP and was on the escalations team. ----Enough back story. 

Here is the cast:

Me is well me

CW: is Co-worker

IU: ID10T User

On to the story. 

So it was the day after Christmas and I was working the escalations desk and one of my co-workers comes to me with an issue.

It seams that ID10T user had called in because he was having some connections issues. He had just got a brand new, out of the box,  Gateway computer. I know it was that long ago. Now when he was setting it up and when he got to connecting the phone line to the internal dial-up modem he found that the RJ11 connecter was not on the end of the line. 

Now being the smart and resourcsevill user he is does he go and buy a new phone line??????
Nope, if he did he would not be calling my co-worker. He striped the end of the wires that make up the phone line and sticks it in to the modem port. 

Now most people don’t know that phone lines carry around 48 volts down them to supply the phone’s ringer with power.  

Well my Co-worker tell me this and said that the ID10T user wanted to talk to above her. So I have her transfer the call to me and talk to the guy. 

$Me: Hello sir I understand that you having an issue with your computer connecting to the internet?

$ID10T User: Ya, I plugged the phone line in to the modem and turned the computer on and there was a loud popping and smoke started to come from the hard drive and the monitor. Your internet killed my computer. What are you going to do to make it work?

$ME: Well sir I was informed that you striped the wires in the phone line and plugged that right in to the modem, is that right?

$ID10T user: Ya……..So?

$ME: Well sir there is about 48 volts that is in that phone line. What YOU have done is fry your computer. The voltage has fried the modem, monitor, motherboard, the processor, and the ram. You have turned you computer in to a very expensive paperweight. 

$ID10T user: What are you going to do to fix it. 

$ME: There is nothing I can do to FIX the issue, you broke the computer’s warranty when you did what you did. You will have to try to contact Gateway or the place you got the computer from to see if can be fixed. 

$ID10T user: What do I tell them?

$ME: Well sir that is up to you, I can not tell to lie to them but will have to talk to them to get it fixed.

crispysilicon,The Day of the Cactus,"From my nightmares and the mid 2000s. I give you, The Day of the Cactus.

It's a nice quiet morning in the call center in L2 support at a major US telecom. It's a Saturday.

It's around 11:00AM . I clocked on almost 3 hours ago and I've taken a whopping 2 calls. Only one of those needed troubleshooting, the other was simple. It's so slow our team is gathered around in a ground yakking and playing games rather than at our respective stations.

The room is pretty small, only about 25 people in the room fully staffed. About half that are in the room.

Up on the wall is a gigantic map of the United States, made up of LEDs. Most of the map is green, this indicates everything is normal. A few parts are yellow, this means trouble has been reported but the system is still responding. A few red spots and dots here and there, indicating outages.

I've got my shoes off with my feet up on my desk reading a book. 

All in all, it's a wonderfully relaxing day.

Then it all went wrong. Terribly wrong.

First was the beeping alarms, which none of us knew existed. What the hell is that god-awful racket coming out of EVERY terminal?!

Then I see the wall. And my heart has stopped for a moment.

California, from the middle to Los Angeles, has gone red. 

Millions of people are out of service.

In the room we are staring at the map, the computers and each other. Then headsets start beeping as people start receiving calls. I get a call. Within a minute there are HUNDREDS of calls in my queue, the general queue is in the HIGH THOUSANDS and climbing rapidly.

My system has populated an account from the Los Angeles area. Customer is pissed, has no service whatsoever. I try and cannot get a response from his phone. Actually, NOTHING will respond, it's like a meteor has destroyed Southern California, except I'm on a landline with someone right now.

The entire call center is slammed, I have to tell my customer I'll give a call back then put myself into ""Not Ready"" to start investigating what the hell is going on. Nobody in the room knows anything yet.

The problem is in the GSM network, everything else is working. I can reach all the equipment, but all GSM traffic falls into a black hole of unresponsiveness. 

Someone shouts! There it is! There is a station not responding along Interstate 5! It's COMPLETELY unresponsive, like I can't even talk to the internet equipment and that is very not good. It's *the* link between the halves of the state. The rest of the network does NOT appreciate this link being down either, problems are widespread as the system tries, but cannot handle the load. Other systems are now being affected.

Emergency dispatch technicians to the area to determine what the hell is going on. My Nortel has the call queue in the 10's of thousands. The previously laid back atmosphere in the room is now grim as death.

Agonizing, useless incoming escalation after escalation where I can't tell them ANYTHING useful grinds on. People are very unwilling to hang up the damn phone without any kind of answers. It's grueling and repetitive. 

Finally word (and pictures) come back from the dispatched technicians.... There *is* no relay station. It's gone the way of Alderaan. 

A truck driver with a fully loaded trailer fell asleep at the wheel and drove off the highway. He made it way off the road and plowed straight through our gigantic fake cactus and associated hardware of a relay station. Obliterated, nothing to fix and the site isn't even usable. Sweet Jesus.

The whole time, I'm fielding calls that I obviously can't do anything about and people are *pissed*. (I actually did get ONE call from someone NOT in the affected area who waited through that queue, only one out of hundreds, but it was a welcome relief.)

So this is how we got to learn to build and deploy a mobile relay station. It took a crazy effort between teams to build out the equipment, then figure out how to deploy. By the end of my nightmare shift, the link was functioning and was literally a van-network parked around the brutalized remains of a giant fake cactus and outbuilding. Things were finally coming under control around the time I left and the queue was emptying. 

By the time I walked out the doors, about a hundred two-minute long calls later, I felt like I'd run a marathon. Physically and mentally exhausted. I don't even remember the drive home. My head hit the pillow before the sun had set. The Day of the Cactus, was finally over.",talesfromtechsupport,1074,1568928463
smohk1,My phone number doesn't work!,"This was the helpdesk ticket I got yesterday. Now in addition to being a helpdesk lackey, I also am the Skype for Business engineer/admin aka The Phone Guy.

Yesterday one of our sales reps emails and say ""Every time I call my office number it says No Longer in Service"". Me being the good phone guy I am, dial her number through Skype and get her voicemail. Then to double check I pull out the Development cell phone (not giving her my REAL number lol) and call. I get her voicemail again. Perfect, ticket closed....

But wait...there's more.

This morning I get an angry call from the ladies boss because I didn't fix the problem. Me, being the incredibly polite and articulate person I am (sarcasm) said ""I ain't fixed da problem because there ain't no problem!!!""  He told me ""she called her number and still gets the message ""no longer in service"". I say ""Okay"" and agree to see what's wrong. I call the number again and get the ladies voicemail. Call the boss back, number works fine. Lady still INSISTS it doesn't. I ask the boss to call the number...SURPRISE!!! it works fine. Lady STILL insists she gets the same message. I finally ask her what number she is calling and she has transposed two of the numbers. Big deal, we've all done it. I tell her the correct number and she SWEARS that she has been getting calls on the transposed number for the last 6 months. She INSISTS that I am wrong and she is going to let he boss know and I need to fix it NOW!

This is where it starts getting fun...since I'm terribly wrong, I ask her to check her email signature. It has the correct phone number. I was told ""I must've changed it"" (yeah lady, whatever) so since I ""changed it"" I asked her to check the number on her business cards. I must've changed those too (damn, I'm good since I'm 1800 miles away and just got this ticket yesterday)! I closed her ticket with ""could not duplicate"" and then my CIO called me in his office because the lady called him directly because I'm unprofessional (true) and unhelpful (probably also true) and I got to explain the problem to him. He laughed, shook his head and told me to quit pissing people off and I said ""but boss...it's only 9am. The day is just getting started. Don't put those kinds of constraints on me this early!"" He laughed again and told me to GET OUT and go back to work.

Budsygus,But you're the IT department!,"Ever since getting into IT I get asked for help with people's networks, computers, printers, etc. all the time. Most of the time if they're family or a close friend I'll do it for free. I had a few people I work with ask me to come to their house and set up their new computer. Their *personal* computer that they keep at their *house* and don't use for work.

""Ok, my rate is $50 an hour, but I'll cut it to $35 since I know you.""

""Wait, you're gonna charge me?""

""Yes. This is a side business.""

""But we work together and you're in the IT department. It should be free.""

""Is this a work computer?""

""No, but you're in the IT department.""

""Yes, I'm in the IT department at your *work.* If this is a personal computer then I charge for my time because I'm not getting paid by the company to work on your stuff outside business hours.""

This lady told her boss I ""wasn't willing to do \[my\] job"" and help with her computer, conveniently leaving out that it was a personal computer at her house. Her boss came into my office and said ""Karen said you wouldn't help with her computer. Why not?""

""Did she tell you *which* computer? Because she wants me to go to her house after work and set up her personal computer. She also hinted she needs help with her network and her printer as well. I told her I'd cut her a deal on my hourly rate, but she thinks I should do it for free.""

""Wait, she wanted help with her own personal computer? Not her work computer?""

""Exactly.""

Her boss then goes off and tells her that the IT department doesn't do house calls and if she wants help she'll have to pay someone.

bekoj,"No I'm not spying on you, but I guess I could","I work as the Jack-of-all-Trades IT guy for a medium-sized business. One of my most recent actions was to stop using Teamviewer (which we weren't paying for) and since we didn't have the budget (nor the need honestly) for a license and after getting approval from the direction, I deployed Winvnc on all our machines. Free remote control software that is pretty easy to deploy and works well in a LAN, that's all we needed. Everything was working smoothly and I was pretty happy with myself.

...Until one of our sales guy came to me asking ""Hey OP, what is this icon that appeared recently ?""

Me : ""Oh it's the new remote control software I just deployed.""

Him : ""Some guys downstairs looked it up on google and they think the direction is spying on us with this""

Me (*Confused*) : ""What ? No, i'm the only one having access to it anyway, and i only use it for remote support""

Him : ""But it can be used for spying right ? They found some stories about it""

Me : ""Well... I guess technically it could since it can remotely take control of any PC he's deployed in, but the direction doesn't have access to it, and I'm only using it for remote control. Besides that would be completely illegal""

Fortunately my explanations convinced him, but still, out of curiosity I googled ""winvnc spying"" (in my language) to see what they stumbled upon...Turns out there are A LOT of stories about unethical use of the software. It never occurred to me how easily I could use it for spying, so I guess my users kinda have a point there.

In the end, I said to our users that the day i'll spy on them, I won't use a software with an icon that looks like a mix between Sauron and the Illuminati. I thought that convinced them.",talesfromtechsupport,986,1568820180

6 days pass, it's 2 pm. By that time all classes have ended and I am expecting some teachers to go on a break, before going into the other shift, and the others to go home. But I hear someone kicking stuff around in a classroom. I go there, and I see a teacher trying to unplug all the computers.

I ask, ""May I know what you're doing, sir?""

He replies, ""Oh, I'm just unplugging all these computers, so IT won't upgrade them.""

I say, ""Uh, I'm IT. And our team can plug them back in.""

He screams, ""What? You will UPGRADE THESE? I don't want to upgrade!""

I say, already tired of this, ""Well, we're gonna have to. We can keep the wallpaper if you want.""

He then just says that I should go away. I do, but write that down.

We had a particularly explosive doctor around that was known for yelling at staff etc. so of course we were told to treat this person with kid gloves.

somekindathowaway,"An extremely Smart, Knowledgeable, and Irritating User vs. a Compliant Linux Image","I work for a fortune 1000 company, in a middle-of-nowhere research office. We have very few employees, and very few ties to HQ. We basically do what we want, as long as we’re compliant and secure. 

Corporate has a standard Windows image, but it’s FAR to locked down for research purposes, and we have people working on tools for other platforms. In the past, we had Mac and Windows images, but I was hired to create a Linux image with the same feature parity; encrypted disks, no split-tunnels, locked down hardware, hardware tokens for network auth, locally-cached user credentials, etc. This will be important later.

Come Monday. We get a new hire, Keith. Keith is a hotshot, straight-from-college developer. He’s smart and he knows it. His ego fills whatever room he’s in. This is his first job ever, after graduating from [Very Prestigious University]. He is Very Smart.

So it comes time for him to get his new computer. He demands Linux. I shrug and grab him a Linux imaged laptop. 

He fake gags when he sees the Ubuntu startup screen. “Why not use a real OS like Arch?”

Oh boy. This ones going to be fun.

When I’ve finished walking him through setup, with him griping and complaining about everything from the window manager to user logins, I hand him back off to HR to go through orientation.

I turned to my coworker, and tell her “I give him three days to break it.”

Two days later;

I get a call from him, saying his system isn’t connecting to the Research VPN. Oddly, he doesn’t complain about his “crappy os” or how “bad it is”. I instantly guess what he’s done, but need to confirm it first.

I have him send me his error log, and immediately confirms my suspicions. “OpenVPN on Arch Linux blah”. 

He had reinstalled his OS. He was no longer on a compliant device.

“Where are you? I’ll need to do some manual intervention.”

Kieth: “Upstairs in the Developer room.”

I contact our Security Officer and we head over to Keith. Keith is then escorted to another room while his laptop is confiscated.

Oh by the way, he was working in a room full of people working on extraordinarily sensitive materiel for our company, on contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

And he had just brought a modified, unsecured device into the center of that room.

After an hour of copying his drive, then booting up the copy, then taking three seconds and one additional line of text to break in (single-user mode is a thing people), I could start looking at the damage.

And oh boy there was a lot of it.

The OpenVPN error was that a script was unable to run. However, he had removed said script, and commented it out in the config file. He couldn’t copy it because on the compliant systems, that script couldn’t be read by anyone but root. He couldn’t become root because he couldn’t sudo, he couldn’t enter single user due to boot menu protection, and he couldn’t access the disk because of a mix of hardware- and software-based encryption.

That script checked that a system was compliant, re-routed internet access through a proxy, prepped firewall rules to deny incoming connections, then connected through to the R&amp;D networks that user was allowed to access, based on what contracts they were on.

Before he reinstalled, the system was logging to our local servers. There were several minor security alerts where he had tried to sudo up to root, or somehow become root. We usually ignored them because 99% of people accidentally would type commands for their R&amp;D systems into the local console, not realizing. Any large, systematic incidents would be caught by the SIEM and reported.

Going through the hardware’s logs though, I saw that he had tried to root his Ubuntu image massively. He had wiped the BIOS, presumably to allow USB booting, then wiped the TPM. This prevented him from accessing the encrypted partition at all. After that, he had reinstalled.

However, the fact that he was even able to connect to the network on a non-compliant machine concerned us, since we had an 802.1x profile for the switch ports.

It turned out it was misconfigured, and was only checking MACs for several ports. So at least he helped us find that error.

After a very, very stern talking to, and a slap on the wrist, he was let back in, humbled and a lot more aware of not wiping his laptop. He was given a Windows machine, and we’ll see next Monday if the slap on the wrist worked, or he’ll need a boot out the door.

The funniest part is that these systems are supposed to be remote access to the R&amp;D network, where you can use whatever OS your heart desires as your remote-access workstation. If only he had known.

TL;DR: “I use Arch, btw” user complains about, then wipes his Ubuntu system. Compliance requirements then smack him in the face. User’s ego is deflated, and a tiny little security hole is found and patched. Yay.",talesfromtechsupport,1841,1568524135
Super_Bad_64,User does not understand how time works,"This story takes place this past thursday.

As part of an annual sports event in the company I am currently interning in, me and another intern made a small website to track the run distance of our willing coworkers (aka basically everyone that is not in IT, shockingly enough). At the very top of the page,  there is a big warning that says the logging function will only be enabled during the night from thursday to friday.

9AM, I roll into work, cursing traffic jams in seven different languages simultaneously, and am immediately greeted by a dozen of messages from someone in marketing, that while not outright hostile, I can tell are seeping with anger. Before answering, I take a look at my mails and see a company-wide notice announcing the website to be live (predictably, it's not, and was never planned to be), followed by a chain of mails that is far too long to have been produced in the span of an hour (we open shop at 8). Guess who's the one who wrote the announcement in the first place.

I open up the IM client and just as I start typing my response, I get a call from the marketing guy. I shall be $Me, and he shall be $Marketing in the following conversation.

$Me: H'lo ?  
$Marketing: Why is the website not working ?  
$Me: It ain't supposed to be. Says so on the front page: ""You will only be able to log your data starting friday at midnight""  
$Marketing: It's thursday ! Why isn't it working yet ?  
$Me, *probably audibly confused*: Because friday comes after thursday ? (*Note: at this point the remainder of the open space is rolling on the floor laughing, and it takes every fiber of my being to not join them*)
$Marketing: *You* said it would go live in the night between thursday and friday !  
$Me: I did.  
$Marketing: Why isn't it live then ?!  
$Me: It's not friday yet.  
&lt;Cue a few repeats of this with the marketing guy becoming increasingly angry&gt;  
$Me: The event starts tomorrow at midnight, there is literally no point in enabling data collection before it even starts, this'll just skew the dataset.  
$Marketing: That makes no sense ! Why would the company start an event on a saturday ?  
&gt; Segmentation fault (core dumped)

$Me: ...You know that days start at midnight and end at 23:59:59, right ? (*cue the peanut gallery going wild again*)  
$Marketing: Forget it, I'll talk to &lt;head of IT&gt;. He'll help me, unlike some low level intern.  
$Me: Sure thing.

Rather unsurprisingly, my boss basically (and intentionally) repeated my words to $Marketing, until they apparently got through. 15 minutes after the end of their chat, a new company-wide announcement popped into our inboxes, proclaiming that due to a scheduling error, the website would only go fully live tomorrow.",talesfromtechsupport,1367,1568459758

Again, there's only two of us, and when someone has a helpdesk request, since we're either doing provisioning, network administration, or something else, most of the time they call for site security to sweep the halls of the buildings, and security physically escorts us to the user having the issue.

So, 10 to 20 times a day, I'll try to do a deployment, or work in a distribution frame, and I'll hear radio chatter behind me and a ""GOT 'IM!"" and sometimes be led, by the arm, to buildings a 10 minute walk away.

Such reasons for being ""escorted"" this week have been:

1. User forgot where the ""enter"" key was
2. User forgot password (written in front of them on a post-it note, I pointed it out then wagged my finger)
3. A pencil sharpener wasn't working (needed plugged in)
4. User didn't understand how to plug in a USB drive
5. User having issue with air conditioning unit. (after the 12 minute escort, Informed user I was IT, not facilities.)

In addition to this, we get scheduled to meetings both as ""standby"" and participant (sometimes double booked, as mentioned in previous posts). ""Standby"" is where we are summoned and requested to stay whenever there is technology involved (Video conferences, WebExes, Skype calls) because the managers ""need"" IT to be in the room with them in case something happens.

As such, the past 2 days, about 8 hours each day has been dedicated to being present in these meetings. This happens sometimes; it was an administratively meeting-heavy week. If we try to duck from these meetings, cue the security sweep and escort. Learned that one the hard way.

Director of our department ($D1 from previous story) has been asking for updates regarding the deployment of new units and a status report on how many old units remain across over a dozen+ building complex.

Our network itself is locked down by our governing body; I previously informed $D1 we have no access to sweep the network across this sprawling site (with my bit of infosec background, I tried things like nmap scans and nse scripts).

So here we go, into today's story.

$D1 calls me into their office and asks me to shut the door.

$D1: ""How many units were deployed the past two days?""

Me: ""We were scheduled as standby for \[Meeting1, Meeting2, Meeting3..\] both days.""

$D1: ""And where is the status report I asked for on the outstanding endpoints?""

Me: ""We have not been able to physically go around to all of the sites. We were scheduled for these meetings, and escorted for various helpdesk requests. I CC'd you on all of the tickets generated.""

$D1: ""$pukeforest, I get the feeling you are **deliberately disobeying** my requests.""

Me: ""As I mentioned, we are requested to be in multiple places at once. What you are asking for is physically impossible right now.""

$D1: *now yelling* ""I **EXPLICITLY** asked you to **COMPLETE THIS REPORT!!!**""

Me: ""How can I walk around the site, inventorying units while scheduled to standby in conference rooms AND deploying units AND being escorted around for non-IT issues?""

*$D1 stares at me with the intensity that I just insulted their family*

Me: *pleading* ""Can someone else please just be trusted to set up conferences and WebExes?""

$D1: ""**BUT. YOU. ARE. I.T.!!**""

Me: ""Could we get area managers to report back how many old units are in their locations? I'm just trying to offer solutions so that we can execute on schedule.""

$D1: *seething* ""Leave. My. Office. **NOW.**""

A few minutes later, get a call from HR, requesting I meet with them. On my way to HR, I hear another ""GOT HIM!"" and was, again, escorted by security to a user 3 buildings away.

Issue: A monitor was turned off. A simple power button press fixed it.

Finally, in HR's office, I am presented with a written warning for multiple accounts of ""insubordination"", along with a ""Day of Reflection"" (one day suspension without pay).

I refused to sign off.

I was told to see $D1 after reading my warning. So, I return to $D1's office.

$D1: ""$pukeforest, I think you understand why we had to do this. I don't like having to take disciplinary action.""

Me: ""actually, I don't understand at all.""

$D1: ""well, now you have an extra day to think about it. And I expect that report first thing on your return.""

Me: ""That's not possible. I have to be here physically to inventory the site.""

$D1: ""You are dismissed.""  


I stood up, thanked $D1 for their time, and walked out.

I placed my keys, ID card, and fob on my desk, took all personal items with me.

I then left the site. I still had an hour left in the day. Didn't even clock out.  


I've been really nervous posting all of this. 

I just want this entire situation to go away, and to have a normal job in IT again. I just wanted to be an information security guy.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't return to homelessness. 

It was such a long climb back. 

I'm eyeing my assets and seeing how long I can hold it down.

&amp;#x200B;

But hey, at least I have a CISSP this time. 

And several awesome members of this community have reached out to offer assistance. Friendship, guidance, job leads, you name it. That is infinitely more than I had before. 

I have hope that this will all be alright in the end. That changes everything.

Shadow293,But We Need This! WHY Are You Doing This!?,"This happened somewhat recently and still makes me chuckle and facepalm simultaneously. Healthcare is a very interesting area of IT to work in and makes me question how some people managed to graduate from university, let alone high school. Good times. 

I was asked by HR to replace a long lost color printer from another clinic location that was costing the company thousands of dollars just for toner and install a basic black &amp; white printer in it’s place. This was for one of our many clinics’ front desk stations. Once I arrived onsite, the following transpired:

Me = Me
K = Karen (definitely a Karen)

Me: “Hi Karen. I was sent here to replace the large color printer and install this newer, more compact b&amp;w printer.”

K: *gets very agitated* “WHAT!? WHY!?”

Me: “HR has requested that we swap printers out” 

K: *getting increasingly angrier* “But we need this! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS!? I’m going to talk with HR Director” *has HR Director’s phone number and starts tapping furiously*

Me: ..............

K: *lets out a shrill reeeee after texting* I can’t believe she’s taking away our printer! How are we going to print out these decorations!? Our patients love these!

Me: “alright new printer has been installed. Test page ca—“.

K: “WE DON’T EVEN GET AN ADULT PRINTER!? IT’s TOO SMALL!” 

Me: “This is the standard printer for our front desk staff”. 

K: “F-Fine! Whatever. I can’t believe you’re taking this away from us”. 

Me: “Have a nice day!” 

TLDR: HR asks me to get rid of a color printer a particular front desk staff member was “secretly” hoarding for arts and crafts, gets mad and texts HR director only to be told it’s gotta go. User gets pissed because now she can’t play with arts and crafts to decorate the front desk area.",talesfromtechsupport,1143,1568305186
drivabledisc748,A Computer Was Stolen!!,"This is going to be a pretty short story but one me and my co-workers died laughing over. For some background, I am a undergrad student working as a general IT guy (I do everything from help desk to setting up switches and servers). When I was hired, I mainly did support at company HQ,over the past few months I started to support some of the smaller satellite offices.

Cut to last week when I was in remote office with a to do list of general maintenance items. One of those items was to move a workstation employees would use to remote into out of the cubicle area over to a copy room to make room for a new hire. I worked closely with a department head on this to make sure they knew where this computer was going to be moved to, so on and so forth.

The NEXT day, I am back at company HQ and all of IT is getting emails that a workstation was stolen from right under our noses. Copied on these emails was of course a distribution group that included everyone in the remote office. Needless to say there was panic and crazed people trying to figure if anything else was stolen. It didn't take long for us to find out this all started when the department head started emailing people saying the remote workstation (you know the one) had been stolen. In the span of 12 hours this absolute genius of an engineer had completely forgotten that HE wanted me to move the remote workstation. Needless to say it took hours for people to finally get it in their heads that there was no robbery.",talesfromtechsupport,1214,1568265323

This one wasn't difficult but it was a time waster for sure.

$me: An eager new employee.
$tm: Time-waster, who is convinced the software 'doesn't work'.

We recently started our transition, company wide, from desk phones to softphones. It works flawlessly except for $tm, apparently...

&gt;$me: Good morning, service desk, you're speaking with $me

&gt;$tm: Hi. My softphone_software isn't working properly. I'm really frustrated because it never seems to work for me and I have to call from my mobile to get help.

&gt;$me: Ok, let me take a look. What exactly is happening?

&gt;$tm: My headset isn't working, it never works!

&gt;$me: OK, let me connect to your machine. 

I got the machine number from her and remoted in.

&gt;$me: So from what I can see the headset isn't connected and it isn't picking it up. Can you please check it's plugged in?

&gt;$tm: I'm not stupid it's definitely plugged in. I've tried a different plug and everything. 

&gt;$me: Ok well the software isn't recognising the headset and neither is the playback device area. Has the headset ever worked?

&gt;$tm: Yes it works fine it's just intermittent. It's a brand new headset.

&gt;$me: Ok well because it isn't working we'll send a tech on over to take a look.

So, I had to ask a tech to go on-site to check her headset out which I hate to do because it's normally a simple plug in. Lo and behold, the USB cable is not plugged in. The user then tells the tech that they 'most definitely had it plugged in'.

GenexenAlt,"'Your tech broke my PC, I want to be reimbursed for a new one!""","Reading the title, it seems like a reasonable request, right? 

I work at a company that provides and supports field technicians for one of, if not the largest ISP in Belgium. My job is at the Servicedesk, or IT support. I don't assist the client directly, but instead company employees and field techs. It's usually stuff like 'You forgot to activate your VPN' or 'You cant use Chrome for \[platform\], use IE' yada yada. Pretty simple stuff.

Anyway, one of the planners (the people that plan in the techs to specific jobs) came to our 2-man desk and asked 'Can I borrow you guys your expertise?'. Thats... A odd way of putting it. 

Me: A flying fucking meatball  
P: Planner

P: 'So, one of our techs accidently unplugged the power supply to the pc/server of one of the clients, and said client claims that the PC is now completely broken and unusable. What I need to know, is that possible, and is his replacement computer a reasonable one?'  
*P hands me the invoice for the original pc.*  
Me: Hm. Looks like a  Gigabyte Brix (think Intel NUC, tiny little cube that can do office work) with a SSD in it... I dont think it can actually break, atleast not a computer this recent (2015). Data corruption, sure, Windows not working, perhaps. But full-bore hardware failure? I highly doubt it.   
P: See? Thats what I was thinking. But he claims a total hardware defect. Here, this the new PC he bought. Is this a adequate replacement?

Now, the Brix he had was a simple one. Dual Core I3, 250Gb mSATA, 8gb DDR3 (iirc). Not powerfull, but I'm sure it did its work. The invoice was...

Me: The hell? Is he serrious?  
P: Yep, no doubt. Why?  
Me: Intel i5 8600K? GTX 1050Ti? 16Gb DDR4 Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO? 1Tb Samsung 980 SSD? A fucking Sharkoon TG5 RGB case? ROG STRIX Z370-F? This PC is easily worth twice, if not three times the initial one! Hell, this thing is almost the same as my own gaming rig at home, and that thing can run Crysis!(Planner is a gamer, but doesnt know much about hardware, so he gets my joke). No, this is ridiculous.   
P: So.... He's bullshiting us?    
Me:  Let me put it this way. Our tech bumped his 10-year old Lada, he claims it no longer runs, and he bought a brand-new BMW to replace it.    
P: Deny claim?  
Me: Deny claim. I'd be happy to write a 'letter of expertise' if you want

So, the planner is off to tell the client to fuck off. Hopefully, that letter wont be needed, but we'll see if the client wants to combat the denial. Funny thing is, if he just went and bought a new Brix, he would've gotten reimbursed, no question.

I asked if he had another copy he said ""No. But you shouldn't need to have the password anyway. Surely you just plug it in and it appears? Right?""

pukeforest,"""Dialing phones for users is now IT's responsibility""","Happened today. I am still in disbelief. 
There might be typos, I'm still calming down.

Backstory: I am one of only two IT personnel at a dozen+ building facility with over 1,000 endpoints. Naturally, they smash every IT position into one role. 

We issue multi-factor authentication devices to management and some senior staff so they can do their work offsite. Once the handoff of the device is complete, our responsibility ends, and user has a packet with all the data to get them up and going. A separate, remote team for MFA exists exclusively for support of these devices. This has been protocol for years.

Clock in and find nasty email from Director #1 ($D1) sitting in my inbox this morning about how ""unacceptable"" and ""unbelievable"" that one of their staff could not log in from home this weekend due to $user's MFA device not ""functioning correctly for months"" (first we've heard of the issue).

Director has been in their position 10+ years.

My response (cc'd to all directors): ""All support for these devices is handled by the MFA team as stated when the devices are issued. We have neither the tools nor ability to help in this matter. In the future, please have the user contact MFA team at ### as explicitly stated in the documentation.""

30 minutes later, I am called into $D1's office. $D1 and two other directors ($D2, $D3) start arguing with me why I didn't solve the issue.

Me: ""All support for these devices is handled by the external MFA team. $user can call the number provided for support. As I said, we do not have the tools to do this.""

$D3: *screaming* ""WOULD YOU JUST DO YOUR JOB??""

Me: *staring* ""what.. what is it exactly you need me to do?!""

Picture three directors, cursing and pointing at me for nearly 10 minutes. I'm talking walls are vibrating with their screams. Other directors in the hall close their doors as I am getting verbally clobbered. I stare through the wall. My anxiety is through the roof.

Insult after insult about work performance, how this is typical of how shoddy we are as IT professionals.

Finally, $user in question comes to the door.

$D1: ""DO YOUR DAMN JOB and get $user set up!""

I'm visibly shaking at this point. Stunned.

Breathing heavily, I manage to walk over to $D1's desk phone. On speakerphone, I proceed to dial the off-site MFA team's number. 

A voice comes on the line.

""$MFAguy, can I help you?""
I motion to $user to introduce themselves and speak their issue.

About 90 seconds later, $user can log in. Tested. Works perfectly.
Everyone is silent and staring at me.

Skandranonsg,A Crime of Opportunity,"Let me take you back in time, to the ancient world of 2014, where Skandranonsg learns of the folly of a life of crime. The first act of this story will be told from the perspective of our local ne'er-do-wells.

----------

""Alright, ready?""

The quiet din of the industrial park is punctured by the sound of shattering glass, followed by the angry wailing of the security system, a cacophonous clock reminding the two men crawling through the barred door that their time in this place would be short.

""That one."" An arm extends towards a large TV sitting on a shelf, while the other reaches for a slim computer tower closer to the entrance. Their first haul stowed away in the back of their aging red pickup, they return for another. Not spotting anything else obviously valuable, a desk is overturned, drawers emptied, but nothing else makes it out the door except for a half-disassembled laptop from the tech's bench.

As briefly as it took you to read this section, the thieves were gone, adrenaline coursing at their act of larceny committed that night.

----------

Fortunately for the small time distributor I was working for at the time, we couldn't have asked for less intelligent thieves. It was determined immediately that this was not even remotely planned, nor was it an inside job, as the items stolen were not exactly the ideal targets.

The TV was a display model for digital signage with a proprietary controller. Without that company's software (that you get for free when you purchase a TV) and the controller, the thing is practically worthless. The desktop that was taken was just a case with a power supply and motherboard, and the laptop was pretty much a write-off already.

They just so happened to walk by 3 boxes, each containing between forty and sixty 8 GB sticks of RAM, a box with ~50 Windows 7 and 8 Pro/Business licenses. Each of those boxes weighed significantly less than what the thieves stole, but was worth orders of magnitude more.

Situation: Customer is a small company that operates an office and a workshop location.

In order to start the RDP connection they simply click the RDP icon on the desktop and enter their credentials.

Client: ""Hey, the remote connection doesn't work!""

Me: ""Ok, what exactly doesn't work? Is there an error message?""

Client: ""Well there used to be an error message. I don't remember what it said. Now it just doesn't work.""

Me: ""So what happens when you try to establish the connection? Just nothing?""

Client: ""The icon is gone. I can't do anything.""

Me: ""Ok, let me do a remote support session on your machine then.""

\*\* client starts our remote support software and let's me connect \*\*

Me: ""Indeed, the icon is gone. It also isn't in the recycling bin. Let me check the RDP connection software.""

\*\* I look at the software and it's completely empty. Like that client-machine never had established an RDP connection to a server-machine... \*\*

Me: ""Well that's strange... it looks like every trace of the RDP connection has disappeared. And you tell me it just did this by itself?""

Client: ""Yes, as I said... there once was some error message and then the icon just disappeared!""

Me: ""Ok, let me just get the connection information and credentials so that I can setup the connection again.""

\*\* While getting the credentials  for the RDP connection it started to dawn on me...  \*\*

Me: ""Hey, just another question... the Desktop I'm connected to right now... is this the Desktop of the PC in your workshop or did you already establish the remote connection to the office and then connect me into that?""

Client: ""Ah, yes, I already connected to the office. I thought that makes it easier for you.""

Me: ""... well ... but you said your problem was that you can't establish the remote connection... so this obviously can't be the case if we in fact right now are connected...""

Client: ""Now look, it doesn't work! I can't start BADSOFTWARETHEYUSE! The icon is missing.""

Me: ""Oh, well, that's quite a different issue then...""

My eyes found their target, sending commands to my finger to reach out and stab once at the keyboard in front of me. Years of experience guiding my digit as it descending to one key in particular. An arrow point to the left with a little upwards tail.

Pof_no,I flew to Ohio because someone couldn't figure out how to charge their laptop,"This happened last week, well the trip did, this situation has been going on for over 3 months.  

I work for a large company and we have sales reps all over the country.  I'm the product owner/systems owner for a lot of the tools and technology that our sales people use. I'm not technically in technology, but I have a development background, so end up getting involved and protecting a lot of our IT staff from stupidity...

Anyway, one of our long term sales reps, who is based in the middle of nowhere in Ohio (a 2 hour drive from Columbus airport) called in to tech support about 3 months ago stating that her laptop wasn't working.  We had our annual sales meeting in  June so we told her to bring the laptop with her as we always bring some of the IT folks for stuff like this.  She brings the laptop and IT lead notices battery is dead so charges it up and it turns on fine.  We tell sales rep, she confirms it's working now and we thought it was a fluke or maybe a bad charger so we gave her a spare charger.  

The week after the sales meeting she emails and calls us to say that the issue is back her laptop won't turn on.  And she charged it all night with the new charger.  We start thinking something could be wrong, so we order her a replacement send it out and send her a box to send her laptop back in.  She confirms replacement is working and we received her laptop charged it up and it worked fine, so we ended up testing and reissuing it to someone else who didn't have any issues.  

A few days go by and sales rep calls in again and tells us the same issue with her laptop, it's not turning on. We ran through troubleshooting and our IT lead did a facetime call with her and she was completely belligerent at this point. Yelling at me our IT staff and my manager who is the CIO of our division.  

We ended up sending her multiple replacements and they would consistently stop working after about 3 days.  She sent an email to all our C level executives complaining about me and the IT staff that we keep sending her broken computers and don't understand laptops and that she wants one of us to come to her home office ASAP otherwise she's entertaining offers from competitors.  Well Head of Sales told us we needed to fix this...

She refused to come into us even though part of her territory is only 2 hours from us.  And since she made a big stink so my pregnant ass (yep I'm pregnant) had to fly to her last week.  She wouldn't even meet me in Columbus at a hotel, I had to drive 2 hours to her home office.  

So I get to her home office and she shows me her laptop and the charger and what's going on.... 

The plug for the charger has a square back instead of a round one, it's almost the same shape as where the ethernet cord goes.  Guess where she was putting the charger...  So that is why her 8 or so laptops we sent her stopped working after 2-3 days, the battery would die because she wasn't charging it properly.  I taped a sticky on the top of her laptop with an arrow pointing to the left where the charger goes so she doesn't get confused.  

She barely thanked me and told me it was my fault for changing our laptops from HP to Dell that there are too many square holes so how is she supposed to know where the charger goes.  I didn't make that call BTW, our parent company did because they had a better lease agreement.  

And to make matters worse when I got there she said to me ""Oh you look puffy, have you gained weight?""  NO I'M PREGNANT, BUT NOT PREGNANT ENOUGH TO REALLY TELL ANYONE YET AND THAT IS WHY I'M PUFFY YOU A\*HOLE.

SaphiraStorm,Who would have thought a button could actually be used...,"This takes place in an ATC ACC, so not exactly a low tech environment. 

A few years ago, at the simple TFT displays for a weather information display were due to be replaced at every single air traffic controller working position, approx. 800 in the whole company, 100 at our site. As working in ATC is as close to real paranoia regarding system failures can get, there is even a secondary system ready to provide weather updates on that display, using a different input port, in case the primary system fails, and users can manually switch between those systems e.g. in case of a hung system, by simply pressing a button on the display's bezel, thereby toggling the input source. 

The new displays arrived, were tested intensely and generally seemed to be much better than the old ones - after 10 years of 24/7 operations those were definitely not in their prime any more.

Soon after installation, we noticed that the new displays were prone to disastrous (as in ""dead"") failures whenever a user pressed the gleaming, stylish input selector button.

Who in their right mind would ever design a button with a decorative metal fitting around the metal button that, when short-circuited by the user's finger, would fry the display's electronics? The only way to switch sources without endangering anything was with a non-conductive pen or wearing gloves. WTF? 

The manufacturer had to modify all those displays, they certainly earned no money on that sale.",talesfromtechsupport,1001,1567600823
Akuzimo,"It's Active Directory synced, you're gonna get smacked if you do this","Was working on an issue for a user; they called in using this program called ResWare.  We're going to call this user ""Rani"".

In ResWare, they export documents and such to MS office.  This is pretty standard with pretty much any LOB programs that do reports/finances en masse.  Okay, cool, traditional problem.  Here we go, boys.

So she calls in telling me that she's having issues with opening documents in office.  It was hard enough to understand with a combination of accent and the phone being muffled, but I like a challenge so let's see.  I remote in to the machine and see the issue, office is asking for creds when logging in.  Okay, so the product is unlicensed.  Simple enough.

At this point, I had Rani log in.  No good.  Wouldn't take creds.  Well, there could be a number of reasons for this but I don't feel like digging into them so I just had her try a few more times, same result.  Okay, fine.  I see how it is.  Site uses O365 though, so let's see if they can even log into that.

So I had Rani log into this and it didn't work.  Pass or username is no good.  Ha.  So it's a password problem.  But it's never that simple.  Here it comes.  You can feel it.  I felt it as soon as I saw those dreaded red letters.  


Me:  ""All right!  So it appears your password is wrong.""

Rani:  ""It couldn't be.  It was just working the other day.""

Inner Me:  ""no.  Stop.  Don't do this to me, Rani.  Don't.  You're gonna make me get greasy with you.""

Me:  ""I understand it may have been working the other day but sometimes this happens with O365 systems.  Passwords expire or, for some random trick of the ether, they just stop working.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, we all know passwords don't just ""stop working"", but most users don't inquire after that.  I wish it would've been that simple.

&amp;#x200B;

Me:  ""Let me check something real quick for you..."" \*logs into O365 admin\* ""We may need to reset your password.""  \*sees that account is synced with Active Directory.  Victory, so they're using SSO.\* ""All right!  So it seems your password is synced with AD, meaning they should all be the same.  Try your computer login please.""

Rani:  i shouldn't have to do that.  The passwords have always been different.

Inner Me:  ""I'm gonna have to do it to her.  I'm REALLY gonna have to do it to her.""

Me:  ""I understand that, but as of right now your account is synced with the server.  This means that every password that is like that will be the same.  Almost like one, big, easy to use system.  Makes life much more streamlined for you.""

Rani:  ""but I never had to do this before.""

Me:  ""Let's try something..."" \*locks computer\*  ""Login for me, please.""

Rani logs in, after saying something about it.  I noticed she typed in a stupid long password.

Me:  ""What password was that?  The one you said your email pass was wasn't anywhere nearly as long as that.""

Rani:  ""Yes, because the passwords are different.""

The inner me at this point is furious like that character from Inside Out.

Me:  ""They're linked together, so let's try that.""  After she logged in, this verified her AD account wasn't locked

Pass didn't work in O365, I'm guaranteeing she half-assed it but whatever.  I'm going to beat this issue to death if it kills me.  Tried it several more times, no good.

Rani:  ""I don't know why this is taking so long.  A previous tech from last week was able to do it in 2 seconds and it worked.  I don't know why this is so difficult.""

Inner Me:  ""Okay, so you're flipping telling me a tech did this LAST WEEK and did it completely wrong, which is why we're in this boat.  I wonder who that was.""

At this point she was getting that ""you don't know what you're doing attitude"" and I wasn't about to put up with that because it wouldn't have been good for either of us.

Me:  ""Okay, you know what...""  \*goes into O365 admin\* ""I'm going to reset your password in O365 here... and it'll work.  Watch.""  \*reset pass to what she wanted, had her log in and it worked fine\* ""Now look, here's what's going to happen.  This account is going to work for an hour or two, maybe even a couple of days, BUT this system WILL sync back up to AD and your password WILL NOT WORK.  All right?""

I suspected at this point she didn't want to talk to me anymore because she wouldn't hang around to test her original issue; not being able to send files from Resware to office because her products were unlicensed.

Rani:  ""I'll call you back if there are any other issues.""

Me:  ""Mkay, here's your ticket number for if the issue reoccurs.""

Then I proceeded to put in the internal notes about this foolish interaction because I'm not falling on that sword and having my own competency called into question.  Nice enough lady to talk to, but as stubborn as a brick.",talesfromtechsupport,1209,1567531121

Breaking something further while trying to fix it. 



This is a story about me, trying to fix something and nearly fuck up.

Disclaimer: non nativ english, on mobile, only the management approved go to in-house tech-savvy unofficial it guy


Everything started with a coworker complaining that she isn't able to send anything to the plotter. Of course this, story has to involve a printer, hasn't it?
After she left for the day, I sat down at her Desk and tried to fix, this printer issue. After some tries to get it running by fiddling around in its settings, I decide to remove the printer and it's driver to reinstall it.

Error: ""Can't do this. Resource is being used by printspooler.""

Okay, simple. Restart PC into safe mode and try it from there.

Win + r

msconfig

Entering admin credentials

Check ""Boot to safe mode minimal"" 

Reboot


PC rebooted and I tried to get to the system configuration.
As it wouldn't accept the admin credentials, it dawned to me that it wasn't the best idea, to cut the connection to the network, where the admin user was located.
I had no idea, if there was a local admin user. And as it only would reboot into safe mode, I had manage to brick this pc, 'cause without the local admin credentials I could not get back into the msconfig window. 

I was, considering my options. Declaring defeat and call our ""actuall IT guy"" to fix it, which could take from a few, hours, up to a, week or two before he would show up, or I could try to fix it my self.

I opened up Google on my pc and started searching.

I found something about registry editing via cmd which it wouldn't let me do.

And after some time and trying I read that you could change the safe mode  by getting into the system, recovery screen.

Boot - forced shutdown
Boot - forced shutdown
Wiping the sweat of my forehead
Boot - please wait - system recovery

There I clicked ""safe mode with network"", rebooted and was able to get out of safe mode eventually.


While doing this all, I remembered that the print spooler is a service, which should be listed in the task manager.

NerdyGuyRanting,When someone blatantly lies to you,"In my previous posts I talked about working as Tech support for an ISP. But a couple of months ago I got a job at a service desk for government works. Overall much better job. Like waaaay better. But every now and then I still get some interesting calls. 

I talked to a user and informed her that since we had tried everything we could try over the phone, I needed to send an on site technician.   
She asked for her case to be prioritized.   
I informed her that I can't promise that.   
She declared that it *needs* to be prioritized. Because she had called us ""several times"" about this (she had called twice). And here is the kicker. According to her *every time* she calls us, there is always such a long queue. ""It's always have to wait like half an hour just to talk to a human and not some computer"".

Now this sounded all kinds of weird to me. First of all, the only computer message we use is ""Welcome to \[company\] service desk. If you errand is about \[stuff\] Press 1... etc.""  
The second thing that was weird was the waiting time. Let me tell you. One of the reasons I love my new job is that most days we get a 5 - 10 minute wait between calls. We very rarely have even a 2 minute wait for users. In our contract it says that we need to answer all calls within 30 seconds, that is known as an SLA (Service Level Agreement). If the SLA falls below 90% the company pays a hefty fine. If it goes below 80%, the fine gets worse. 

Our SLA for the month of August, is 97,3%. The only queue we had was one day when all the schools started again and every single teacher needed a new password. But that was one day. And the queues were at most 5 minutes. Before that day, since all schools were out (and schools are most of our business), we easily had 20 - 30 minute waits between calls. We had waits so long my coworkers and I brought Switches to play smash against each other between calls. So to claim that ""every time she calls she has to wait"" is just impossible.

I asked the user if she had to wait in a queue for this call.   
She said yes.  
I asked for how long.   
She said easily 5 minutes.  
So I, with a smug smile, informed her when she called I had been next in line for a call for 4 minutes. Out of 16 available agents, 9 were free (I was number 10 until the call came in). So if she had to wait in a queue for this call, she should probably look in to if her phone is broken and has issues connecting calls.  
She started to backpedal and said ""Well maybe not this time. But several other times.""  
Trying not to laugh about the very obvious backpedal and I asked her when she last had an half an hour wait.   
Guess what? She gave me a date that came before the schools started. I pointed that out as well, and informed her of the long wait times between calls. And again I pointed to her phone as the likely culprit.  
She got flustered, pretty clearly annoyed about her lie not working, and just told me to ""send the damn technician"".   
I obliged.

I mean honestly. Why would anyone think a lie like that would work? Doesn't she realize that we, if anyone, are aware of the queue status? We get briefed each week about our SLA. And the numbers are clearly displayed on a white board when we get to the office. I have enough time between two calls to write everything above this paragraph. 

I heard a bunch obvious lies and excuses when I worked for an ISP. But this was the first time someone tried to lie to me about something I don't even need to lookup to see if it was false. I just knew it was complete bull right away. This was just stupid.",talesfromtechsupport,1187,1567086903
Ser_Alluf_DiChikans,Dell owes me a beer or 12...,"So this is actually happening right now.  
Prologue: I'm a SysAdmin for a small web development company. Bought an employee a refurbished XPS 8930 desktop back in June, and ever since have been fighting memory errors and display issues. My boss finally fed up with listening to me complain says ""it's 2 months old, just warranty the damn thing"". (having done this before) I begrudgingly chat thru dell, explaining the issues to someone who keeps insisting we're troubleshooting a laptop (red flag #1). After convincing her that it is 100% a desktop PC, she determines that the motherboard needs replaced. Naturally this is beyond the skillset of any regular old SysAdmin and needs to be performed by a ""Dell certified technician"". She schedules me an appointment for last Friday, nobody shows (red flag #2). Tuesday a rather grumpy older gentleman in his late 50's shows up to my office with a single stick of RAM (red flag #3). After 2 hours he determines that the motherboard does indeed need to be replaced. So he schedules me another service call for today. And here we are... 

Characters - $me and $dct (dell certified techician)  


I get a call at 10am from a gentleman who is not the tech that was at my office yesterday to confirm my address. i explain where i am at and he says he's very familiar with the area. Also he wants to troubleshoot the PC over the phone as he has no idea what the initial issue was or what actions were performed the day before (red flag #4) At 1pm I get a call, he's 2 towns over and lost (red flag #5). At 1:45 the gentleman is not only knocking on my office door but also appears to be knocking on heaven's gate if you catch my drift... So i lead him to the computer in question   


$dct - what model is this, i've never seen a dell like this before (red flag #6)  
$me - uh... says dell right on the front, it's an XPS  
$dct - well lemme take a look under the hood..... how do i open it? (red flag #7)  
$me - ... um.... (pops panel off)  
$dct - so what did they do yesterday?  
$me - replaced the RAM  
$dct - did that fix the problem?  
$me - (screaming internally) ...i don't think it did...  
$dct - (does some kind of elementary school diagnostics) well looks like i'll have to replace the motherboard. 

The extremely elderly mans hands are shaking so bad he can barely hold a screw driver. But i play dumb and kindly get out of his way so he can do the super difficult ""dell certified"" stuff....

So he finishes replacing the motherboard, turns the computer on, runs the dell diagnostics n gets the green check marks on all components. Feeling quite satisfied with himself, boots the PC.  


$dct - hmmm... says PXE boot failed, press any button to reboot and try again. I don't know what that means.  
$me - you need to change the boot order (i know he prob will have to reinstall or repair windows, but we havent gotten that far yet)  
$dct - the boot order? i don't know how to do that (red flag #8)  
$me - (my soul hurts) F12  
$dct - (after about 10 attempts and still cant get the boot options menu to show) i don't think it's recognizing the harddrive... I better try to reseat it. (he never touches the cables attached to the HD, instead grabs the 2 lock tabs on the drive tray, pulls the tray out about half an inch and pushes it back in) There, that oughtta do it. (reboots PC, gets PXE error again. lets call that red flags #9 thru infinity). O boy. We might just have to get you a new computer.  
$me - (I'm dying on the inside) How do we just make that happen???  
$dct - well i should call my boss first and see if he has any ideas what to do. I'm not real familiar with this model of PC. Seems really new, like it just came off the line or somethin...  
$me - (my soul is officially dead)  


For about an hour, I sat and listened to this very nice older gentleman yelling to his boss on speaker phone, who was trying his absolutely best to get this guy to change the boot order. At one point, they collectively thought maybe the F12 and F2 buttons on the keyboard are both broken, lets swap that out. Surprisingly, this did nothing.

People at work have begun to email and im me asking ""what the hell is going on over in your office?!"" to which i replied ""i actually have no fking idea..."" 

I've actually been typing this as he's been working... Also googling how to become a dell certified technician, so that i too can someday be better at computer repair. so sorry for the crappy formatting, i'll probably have to go back and fix this.

Finally (after i had blacked out and regained consciousness) we get to booting from the harddrive and windows jumps into automatic repair mode. $dct's boss, who sounds as frustrated as i am at this point, says well it got to windows so now it's my problem which i happily agree too (even tho i know that's crap since the last time i had to have dell come out to service a PC in my office), thus concluding the saga of why dell owes me a case of beer.

We also still use Exchange 2010, and are in the process of migrating since I took over. However, everyone has been a bit hesitant to move, since they don't like the look of Outlook 2016.
One morning I walk in and everything is business as usual, but I receive a Gmail notification with the subject line in all caps ""EMAIL ISN'T WORKING!!!!!!""
As I begin walking to my office the VP of sales frantically signals for my attention, and knowing her habits as a user, I grimace and brace myself for her usual ineptitude. 
She immediately starts yelling at me. 
VP: ""The email server is down! I just sent you an email to let you know about it. I can't do any of my work without email. This is so frustrating that you guys don't react immediately to this. At my last company, those IT guys knew when the servers went down before anyone else noticed.""
Me: ""You sent me an email telling me the email server is down from your company mail account?""
VP: ""Yes of course I did, how else could I tell you guys it isn't working? Why don't you take these things seriously?"" she states while rolling her eyes and throwing her hands in the air for added effect. 
At this point I can feel my frustration in my face and try to compose myself. 
Me: ""You sent the email to my personal account. I received your email. Are you seeing any errors when sending emails?""
VP: ""JUST FIX THE DAMN EMAIL SERVER!""
At this point I was speaking through clenched teeth, and typed out a quick test email on my company account to send to her. 
Me: "" VP, I understand your frustration. But I can't fix a problem that doesn't exist. I just sent you an email on my company account. Did you receive it?""
VP: ""OF COURSE IT WORKS IF YOU SEND IT, YOU'RE THE IT GUY! I'M GOING TO CALL THE CIO ABOUT THIS!""
I decided to just saunter over to my office and await the confused and frantic call of my CIO. Instead I receive an email from him stating, ""Don't worry. I know it's working. Just ignore her, she blew a huge deal because she forgot to send an email and wanted to blame it on IT. I checked the mail server and didn't see anything stuck in the outbox. We're all clear.""
As I slowly chuckle to myself, she bursts into my office, which also happens to be the server room. 
VP: "" You need to set me up with webmail.""
Me: ""You're already set up with webmail. Everyone is. I've already sent out several email with instructions on how to access it. You literally replied back to me telling me you refused to use it because you didn't like how it looked.""
VP: ""Well I want access again in case the server goes down again and email doesn't work.""
Me: ""If the mail server goes down and email doesn't work, webmail won't work. It's the same thing. We're in the process of moving to a hybrid solution to prepare for situations like that, but for right now there's nothing we can do other than troubleshoot the issues that arise.""
VP: ""Then why does my Gmail and Yahoo mail work?! You don't know what you're talking about!""
Me: ""We don't have a Gmail or Yahoo mail server. We don't even manage those. That's completely different from our email."" 
VP: ""I'M GOING TO TELL CIO THAT IT IS UNABLE TO HELP ME!""
After she storms out, I go about my day, letting the soothing white noise of server fans and constant AC relax me. 
At the end of the day I receive a text from the CIO.

Insert disk 2 and press enter. Going pretty wel so far. System ask for disk 3? Well, insert disk 3 and 4. 

What do you mean, you can't insert disk 4? It won't fit??? The my father told, the second and third disk were already very hard to get in. Excuse me??? Then I got an idea. Asked him ""did you take out disk one before you you entered disk 2?"". The famous answer was ""No, you didn't say I should, you only said to put in disk 2 (and 3 and 4).""

Rumbuck_274,I set fire to the shredder,"This is a self burn, these are rare, but I'll caveat this that I was IT, and I was the apprentice, they paid me pittance, and I had to accept that some days I was free labour.

Anyway, working at a local council I was at we had a metric shitload of old dot matrix ribbon fed printers, these constantly chugged out reports from legacy systems. Gotta love government hey.

Anyway, the law said this stuff needed to be archived for 7 years, and half of it (actually 99% of it) was garbage reports you read once (at the printer) and let fall into the box.

So, here I am, 7 years later working there when heaps of this stuff comes up for ""Permanent Archiving"" (which was great, as a lot of it was in our IT Backroom)

So the boss graciously volunteers me as tribute to get it done on the basis of it helping the IT Department get some room back.

So here I am, doing what I'm shown, feeding a pile of papers into the shredder, tearing off about a dozen at a time and letting them run through.

For the young ones, [here's a picture of the printer paper setup](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTCRNzlsXb8LSaDKJV-p35FwPtSRXKJRd_skhDbs8lV8yorIjkM) so that you understand what I'm about to say.

Now, me being bright thought ""fuck it, I'll get more done by running the whole sheets through"" thinking the office lady that told me to do it manually was an idiot (I was 17, anyone I didn't agree with was an idiot)

Anyway, I read the shredder ""up to 8 sheets at a time"" it says on the front.

So I line up 8 boxes.

I take the top sheet off every one and make it into a neatly stacked ribbon.

I feed it into the shredder and admire my work.

I'm getting 8 boxes done in the time it used to take me to do 1, half that.

I'm going across the road for a coffee.

Yeah, on my way back, coffee and ham, cheese, tomato croissant in hand, I see the fire alarm going off, people evacuating, and the fire brigade screaming up and running inside.

I locate the IT Department and we all have a chuckle, and go down to get coffees, we'll, me to drink mine and them to get some.

Midway through coffee my boss gets a call, I hear the ""Really?"" and ""You sure?"" and ""That doesn't sound right"" and ""OK, I'll tell him""

So he puts down the phone and explains to me that while yes, my idea was great, and he sees exactly where I was coming from, the shredder was never designed for continuous operation eating ribbons of paper.

The duty cycle on the shredder was a whopping 45 seconds we found out when the Gilbarco guy came out, we estimated the shredder actually lasted 15 minutes.

Props though, I was off the hook as when they pulled the shredder apart they found that it had a thermal overload to prevent this and that had failed. So really, the printer should have turned off before catching fire.

I still had to clean it all out and throw all the burned stuff in the bin.",talesfromtechsupport,642,1566682351
Unease_Peanut,"""We just thought we'd some new phones...""","A client of my company had sent in a ticket complaining about one of their DECT phones shutting down when taken of the charging station for only a few minutes. This is usually a result of old chargeable batteries that just won't charge properly after a couple of months/years depending on the quality.

We let them know that we suspected this was the problem and that we would order some of those batteries for them. The order would arrive next day and we had time to drive it out to them the day after that. The receptionist thanked us for this trivial service as she had no idea what kind of batteries the phone needed (chargeable AAA).

The manager didn't agree though. But didn't let us know any of it.

2 days took way too long apparently and if he decided to get some batteries himself that would fit and be chargeable there wouldn't even be any harm done. We needed new stock anyway.
But instead of listening to us and checking the batteries, he'd decided he'd just buy a new set of phones with base stations and everything. Keep in mind that this was for one out of three phones not working properly.

Here's the kicker. They used VoIP, he bought a landline compatible DECT set (with only an rj11 socket).

Meanwhile we hadn't heard anything after we'd spoken to the receptionist. So when the manager called us why his new phones wouldn't work we didn't really know how to respond. When we got there with the new batteries we saw what he'd done and for the life of him couldn't understand how these new phones wouldn't work. He managed to get power to the base station without any other cable plugged in so the handsets got a signal from it but the line was dead of course. 

After putting in the replacement batteries the problematic handset worked fine and we switched everything back to how it used to be.
I dont think you can get a refund on entirely unpacked hardware so that was tough for the manager.",talesfromtechsupport,1126,1566647784
berkeliyum,“I’m so sick of the entire IT department! She’s too dumb to figure it out herself!”,"I’m a college student and have been working at my university library’s tech support for a few years. We service all of the staff members in the whole library, most of which are very sweet librarians and the rest are awful human beings. 

In comes Staff Member (SM), a middle aged woman whom I haven’t dealt with too often. SM’s printer keeps jamming so I bring it to the IT bench to inspect, searching for scraps of paper or any damage. I then get on Dell support for 1.5 hours and they determine it needs replacement rollers, so I tell SM that it will take 24 hours for them to send the rollers and for me to reinstall her printer. The next day (Friday) the replacement rollers don’t fix the issue, so Dell sends a brand new printer that will arrive on Monday. I tell SM that I will setup her new printer once we receive it. 

On Monday, I plug in the new printer and test it and there’s some new issues. My coworker and I spent over an hour trying to work on it, failed to realize that I needed to move over the imaging drums from the previous printer. So at the end of my shift I apologize to SM and tell her we needed to work on it more tomorrow and I’ll bring it down first thing. 

So on Tuesday, I bring down her new printer. It’s not networked so it connects directly to her PC. Well, when I connect it guess what happens? PC doesn’t recognize it, so I tell her I need to play around with some settings. After 10 mins nothing is working so I tell her I’m going to consult my supervisor about what to do and I’ll come down as soon as I have a solution. 

It’s worth noting that SM wasn’t supposed to have a personal printer to begin with. She recently moved offices and the new one happened to have a printer in it so she’s been using this only for the past couple of months, meanwhile there is a shared network printer literally 5 feet from her office that everyone else in the area uses and she has access to. 

Anyway, I go back upstairs and google what to do (like all good IT techs) and my coworker comes in, he says “uhh, I was just downstairs helping [person] and I overhear SM going ballistic. She says ‘I am so sick of this IT department. They hire the most incompetent students possible. I don’t understand why it’s taken her 3 days to fix this f*cking printer. How hard can it possibly be?! I don’t even think she got me an actual new printer. And of course she had to ask [supervisor] for help because SHE DOESNT KNOW SH*T ABOUT PRINTERS!!! She’s too dumb to figure it out herself!’”

At this point I’m speechless. Not only did I get her a brand new printer when I didn’t have to, but I have been nothing but kind and apologetic to her. Yes, it wasn’t a quick fix. But guess what?! NOT MY FAULT. We all know tech has a mind of its own and sometimes things just don’t work out. 

So I’m incredibly pissed off but I found a solution to the issue (thank god for IT forums) and I go downstairs and install the printer correctly, test print, everything is fine. I say “I’m so sorry this has taken so long, everything that could’ve gone wrong did but it’s all working now!” She says “oh my, no apologies necessary at all. I know none of this is your fault. I really appreciate it.” Fake b*tch but anyway, I’m about to leave and her internet shuts off. Just completely stops working. I run the troubleshooter, try everything under my belt. I apologize again, tell her I’ll grab her a new network cable and see if that helps. She says “I know you’ll figure it out sooner or later” ugh. 

Luckily my coworker dealt with this exact issue before and knew what to do, so I fix it and again apologize cause it’s taken time away from her work. She says “seriously don’t worry about it, the world isn’t ending because my f*cking internet shut off. You’re fine.” 

So that was the end to my painful encounter with this woman. I cannot possibly believe why someone would have so much hatred towards a student worker making $13/hour, and I literally catered to her by myself, spent over 2 hours on Dell support chat, was incredibly nice to her the entire process. Some people are just incredibly entitled and think IT requires no critical thinking. F*ck you, SM.",talesfromtechsupport,2298,1566480295
rykon8472,Hi IT I am having trouble ejecting this floppy disk.,"I have a story from 14 years ago that has stuck with me throughout my whole IT career, it was the very first day working front line help-desk support for a government agency that was pretty far behind the cutting edge of technology.

&amp;#x200B;

I received a call from Jane (not her real name).

Jane: Hi IT I am having trouble ejecting this floppy disk.

Me: Hi Jane, ok can you tell me did the you get any errors from the computer or is there any lights flashing on the floppy drive.

Jane: well no errors but it can't see the disk at all, its also making this horrible thumping noise. \*she holds the phone up the the floppy-drive and the noise it was making can screeching down the line\*

Me: Ok Jane that isn't normal I'll be right down, what floor are you on?

After getting the details I went to her floor, I took the elevator down, when I came out of the lifts I didn't need to ask where she sat as the floppy drive was doing its best rendition of the drum solo from the song 'In the air tonight' she worked in a small office by herself but the noise was filling most of the floor.

As I arrived to Jane's desk I see two stacks of floppy disks one still in boxes and the other stacked on her desk, the stack on her desk was a pile of broken or warped floppy drives, I assumed they were damaged during storage and didn't ask about them (rookie mistake).

After 10 minutes of me going through my checklist (remember first day on the job) as well as trying to eject the floppy disk or get it t read, Jane starts getting frantic about the drives she tell me ""I've been doing this for hours now, some drives work but some don't I'm worried this drive is breaking these floppies and we don't have any other copies of this data""

Me: ""ok why would you say the drive is breaking them, how many floppies haven't worked?"" I pointed over to the pile of broken disks ""did the drive do this to all of the disks?""

Jane: Those are the ones that didn't work they were getting stuck but once I got them in the drive they came out fine, this is the first one I couldn't eject.

She was right the eject button was really stuck, I decided the safest method was to turn off the PC pull out the floppy drive and manually retrieve the disk.

Upon opening the drive (which took 25 minutes because I was new and really not confident on what I was doing) I finally figured out the issue, the floppy drive was not only back to front but also upside down.

Me: Jane can I ask how did you get this in the drive, its upside down and facing the wrong way?

Jane looks at me like I was exercising a demon from her body after the longest most awkward pauses ever she replies in a soft voice.

Jane: Floppy disks have a right and a wrong way to go into drives?

Me: .........Yes, I really don't understand how you got this in there like this can you show me.

Jane proceeds to pull out a small hammer from under her desk.

Jane: The disks that didn't go in correctly I used this to get them in the drive, why is IT equipment so complicated?

Me: I'm going to have to talk to my manager I'll be back soon.

I'm not exactly sure what happened to poor Jane, she was moved to a different section soon after, I still wonder sometimes if she is now chiselling in USB keys into PC's",talesfromtechsupport,1831,1566448262

Reygle: Business name, this is Reygle!

Supervisor: Morning, Reygle.  You helped us get our new copier all configured last week in the office, and now when we scan documents to our email accounts, they take upwards of 40 minutes to arrive.

Reygle: That's pretty odd, I know that none of your users agreed to use folders on your server for scans, and everyone wanted scans directly e-mailed to themselves-

Supervisor: We're never going to scan to folders.  

Reygle: \**urge to off myself rising\** Yep, we talked about that.  I do recall sending a test email to every user we set up- and that most arrived within the minute. (There were 29 of them)

Supervisor: Yep! I was there with you, all went great.

Reygle: So now, the same types of scans are taking entire lunch breaks to arrive?

Supervisor: That's right.

45 minutes later: 

Reygle: Company name, Reygle speaking!

Supervisor: Hi, scans were great for a bit, then I re-enabled high compression mode and they all slowed back down.

Reygle: Wait- **you RE-enabled** it?  Had you recently turned the feature on before you called with this problem? 

Supervisor: ....

Why did you re-enable that?  The 800Mhz processor in your leased copier can't handle the workload while using OCR, which you *really* don't want to go without.  More than maybe 10 pages with that feature on will bring it to a crawl- it's not exactly an enterprise machine.

Supervisor: Oh.  I just scanned 273 pages.

Reygle: That'll arrive next week, maybe never.  Please power cycle the copier if anyone wants to use it for the rest of the day.  Next time you change settings and notice a difference, please let me know before I spend a whole morning billing you.

Supervisor: ...      *incredible pause*      So when I turned that on, I caused this problem?

Reygle: Yes.

Supervisor: What is this going to cost me?

Reygle: 3.5 hours at normal rate.

Supervisor: *longest pause I've ever witnessed in a phone call*  Do you think this is why our last copier was so slow? I had turned it on for that one, too.

CafeteriaBacon,"Please don't tell my boss, but something happened to my laptop","It’s almost lunchtime at the $Hosptial helpdesk. I could barely hear the phone ringing over my stomach rumbling. I’m busy battling Chipolte’s website to get some lunch, so Hippie answers the phone for me.

&gt;Hippie: IT, this is Hippie.

&gt;Caller: Hi, this is Melissa from $RemoteOffice. I have a problem with my computer and I was hoping you could help me fix it ASAP

&gt;Hippie: OK, no worries, what’s up?

&gt;Caller: Uh…I don’t know how to say this, but I think I broke it. 

&gt;Hippie: What do you mean, broke your computer? What’s wrong with it? You can’t login?

&gt;Caller: No, it will barely do anything at all?

&gt;Hippie: That sucks. What happened to it?

&gt;Caller: Well, my cat walked across the keyboard and now it’s not working very well

&gt;Hippie: Hahaha, yeah man, my cats do that all the time. We should be able to fix it no problem. Are you locked out of your account now or???

&gt;Caller: No, the keyboard doesn’t seem to be working quite right. Some of the keys look funny now

&gt;&gt;Hippie: Uh, man, that really doesn’t sound like an easy fix. If you can give me a few minutes, I’ll figure out something and call you back.

&gt;Caller: Oh dear, I was hoping you guys could just fix it now. I’d rather my boss not find out. She would be really mad. I might just keep using it. It still kinda works, but it’s hard to type.

&gt;Hippie: No worries, we should be able to figure something out very soon. I’ll call you back ASAP.

&gt;Caller: Oh great, thanks. The sooner the better, I really don’t want my boss to find out.   *click*

Hippie fills me in and we decide, heck with it. We grab a new laptop and get it imaging. Whatever happened to her laptop, we don’t have any parts on hand, and they’re not going to wait for parts to be ordered in.

That much of the situation sorted, Hippie calls her back

&gt;Hippie: Hi Melissa, this is Hippie from IT. Just calling back to get some more info on your laptop. We’re working on a solution as we speak; just wanted to make sure i’m on the right track.

&gt;Melissa: Oh that’s great. I’ll do whatever I can to help. What sort of info did you need?

&gt;Hippie: Well, first off, what kind of laptop is it?

&gt;Melissa: It’s a Dell

Big oof. Any Dells we had were close to ten years old. It’s way past the refresh cycle. Now there’s no doubt that replacing it was the right move.

&gt;Hippie: OK thanks, that’s just what I need to know. We can’t do anything to fix it, but we can, uh, loan you another one, if you want to stop by today and get it. Now I really gotta ask, what exactly happened to it?

Unfortunately for Hippie, we didn’t get a straight answer, but not long after that, Melissa showed up with an elderly Dell Lattitude that was missing several keys and generally looked like it lost a fight with every sledgehammer ever made. 

She seemed nervous and was very reticent to accept her “loaner” laptop until I labeled it “MELISSAS LOANER LAPTOP”. Somehow that sticker made everything OK and she left with her new laptop.

Melissa’s job meant that she worked very closely with her boss, so her boss found out about the new laptop in about 2 seconds. Boss lady called, more curious than anything, and we explained that Melissa’s elderly laptop had met its fate and we’d replaced it. Boss lady was entirely unperturbed by this news. Being as IT savvy as she was, boss understood that fixing aged computers was pointless.

A few weeks later, Hippie was helping Melissa again and ended up speaking with Melissa’s husband. It seems she needed our help but couldn’t get to the phone. Over the course of the conversation, her husband tells Hippie all the details Melissa left out of the laptop saga. It seems that Melissa had been working from home that day and had placed her running laptop on a very high shelf so she could take a break. Cat jumps on the shelf and lands on the laptop. Laptop and cat take a tumble six feet to the tile floor. Voila, one very startled cat and one very shattered laptop.

I remoted to her PC and had her show me what it was doing. Same dumb .NET error I fought every day, plus an INI file error from being uninstalled wrong in the past. Ten second fix, hopefully. Today I get to be someone’s hero.

So, I ran my .NET script, deleted the INI, and had her try it again. My hero status is in jeopardy...it’s still not working. Time for the hop-on-one-foot-and-bark dance that this hot garbage requires. Reset IE, disk cleanup, clear cookies, reboot PC, re-run the scripts that Corporate IT doesn’t know I have.

Ritual dance complete, we try it again.

DeHackEd,The LED is blinking but it seems fine otherwise,"First time poster, blah blah blah.

I work for an Internet/TV provider and manage, among other things, the TV backend and client software. Received a ticket from the inventory people saying that the set top boxes being tested (returned from customer, tested before being refurbished) have their front LEDs blinking non-stop, but otherwise seem okay, asking what to do. Confused, I make the trip to see it myself. Normally a continuous flashing LED means it's still booting so that doesn't make sense to me.

On arrival I see that the description is correct, but I misunderstood the meaning of blinking. The blinking was rapid, indicating that it's receiving continuous remote control signals. All our remote are IR-based (not radio) which should make finding the source straight-forward. I walk up to the bench confirm my hypothesis: putting my hand in front of the box stops the signal and removing it resumes the signal. So now I slowly use my whole body to try blocking the signal while also pulling up the camera app on my phone in case I need it.

Upon the flashing LEDs returning to solid (to the surprise of those working on the floor), I rotate 180 degrees and look at what's right in front of me... A large transparent plastic container full of remotes haphazardly placed within it sitting on a shelf. I don't even need my phone to find the exact culprit remote - it's the one on the bottom. The ticket creator is following me and, upon seeing the glowing buttons on the remote control, understands what is happening.

taterbizkit,User expects her convoluted Rube Goldberg pathological workflow built on ancient hardware to work indefinitely.," 

I know I should not blame this person for the situation she's in.  And I should blame Tier 2 for this even getting to us.

I  support enterprise ""Unified Messaging""/phone/IM/conferencing software  products, for the publisher of the products, delivering service to its  internal staff.

The problem  statement:  User loses audio when she joins $product meeting.  This  sounds like a fairly simple problem, that rarely would make it to Tier  3.  Inside ticket history, I find the prior problem statement:  ""Phone  Audio"" feature does not prompt to enter phone number in the meeting.   That one is completely useless, except insofar as it tells me that the  current problem statement is out of whack by several orders of  magnitude.

T2 says she is running  the product in a virtual machine -- but they don't say whether it's a VM  locally running on her PC (supported) or a VM running on another PC but  in the same building she's in (best effort only), or if she's using VPN  to remote into a VM running on a server that has its own hardware  abstraction layer. (Supported?  What you been smokin'?)

They  don't say why she's running a VM.  They asked her a lot of questions  that were too complicated for an ordinary user to understand, and it's  clear T2 didn't understand the questions either or they'd have realized  her answers made no sense.

She's  not ""available"" in IM so I keep reading.  Audio works when she's the  first person to join a meeting.  IF she's not the first to join, audio  does not work.  However, in the latter case, if she's the only one  remaining after all others have quit, audio starts working again.

My  head is spinning at this point.   The VM is abstracted from the  hardware of the server.  If she's dialing in remotely, RDP has its own  abstraction layer.  And what's this about using her cellphone as a  speakerphone?

I get in contact  with the user and start asking questions.  Gradually I tease out what's  really going on.  She's not using a VM.  She's remoting via RDP to a  desktop in her office that runs the product client.  When she joins the  meeting, she uses a feature that routes the audio through her cellphone.   it's not that ""audio doesnt work"", it's that when she's not the first  to join, the option to call out never appears.  She can't do her  presentation because she has no audio.

Why  can't she run the product's Android client?  Her cellphone is a Samsung  S3 running KitKat 4.4.  The security software we use will barely run,  let alone client software.

Why  can't she run the product client on her remote laptop?  It's a 2010  workstation-class laptop (Nvidia Quattro) with Windows 7 on it.  When  she runs the client, her laptop crashes and (she says) has to be  reimaged.  Every time she's tried.

The  PC she's connecting to is running Windows 10 at least.  It's a 2014-era  Dell Precision running Windows 10 -- but the on-board audio doesn't  work.

Which is why she has been  using the conferencing system to route audio to her cellphone.  She can  present her powerpoint slides and use her Android 4.4 phone as a  speakerphone.

I ask her ""Have you  tried just dialing in to the conference call with your phone, and  presenting with the remote workstation?""  Her answer:  I'm not sure what  you mean.  ""I mean, dial the conferencing center's telephone number and  enter in the conference ID"".  Her:  I told you I can't run the  telephony client on the phone.

Me: Trying to figure out how to pronounce ""0.o""

Me:  Your phone has a dial pad, right?

Her: Yes.

Me: . . .

Her: . . .

Me: . . .

Her: You mean I could call the conferencing center using my phone?  Will that work?

Me: Fighting the urge to say something snarky. &lt;ahem&gt; "" Y e s ""

Her: . . .   Oh! Oh wait! I get it!  That's BRILLIANT! Thank you SO MUCH.

Me:  So aside from that, what you should do is print out this chat log and  take it to your manager.  I'm pretty solid sure that this conversation  is your business case for getting a new laptop.

This  company generally keeps its staff updated with recent hardware, and has  a two-year refresh cycle.  I'm a contractor, and I've got a Precision  3520 -- not state of the art, but it's got a USB C Thunderbolt port, 16  gigs and an I7.  I do in fact play games on it when I'm WFH or alone in  the office.

I know exactly how  this person got to be where she's at:  FNG gets the scrounged gear.  Manager holds back on spending anything until s/he notices that the FNG  isn't complaining about her crappy 5, 6 and 9 year old equipment.   Ingenious-if-a-bit-thick user figures out how to get her job done with  these ancient relics.  Eventually she forgets that it was an abomination  of a workflow and now can't remember what it was like to have the right  tool for the job.

I'm not sure what you mean.

darxide23,That time I thought I killed a guy over the phone,"This was circa 2000. Worked at a place that handled warranty calls for computers sold through Office Max.

It was already a bad da as we had a lot of calls about systems that would not turn on. Ended up being fried power supplies and motherboards from some really bad storms that had gone through the South over the prior weekend. These were usually easy to diagnose and you'd schedule a tech to go out and try to resuscitate the machine with a new power supply, but company policy required us to go through the standard idiot test steps. ie: ""Is it plugged in? Is the monitor plugged in? Is the monitor on? Is the power outlet receiving power?""

So I we get through the first of those and I get to the last step which is to ask them to try plugging the computer into a different outlet. Guy says ""Ok, the computer is under the desk. Hold on a minute."" He puts his phone down on top of the desk and I don't hear anything as I imagine he's crawling under the desk to unplug the thing. About 30 seconds later I hear a loud crackle and pop sound along with the guy screaming. Then nothing. Silence. I swear 5 minutes went by, but I'm sure it was only another 30. I am screaming over my headset ""Sir? SIR?!"" I thought I just electrocuted this dude.

Finally he picks the phone back up and says that there was a lot of smoke and blue sparks that came out of the back of the computer when he plugged it back in. He was surprisingly chill about it. I guess near death experiences can do that...

Needless to say, I didn't need any further documentation to authorize a tech.",talesfromtechsupport,1435,1565834300
smohk1,Where do you want this network rack?,"The company I work for is currently remodeling the first floor of the building. They are turning into a show piece to bring customers in and show off and WOW! people. I'm part of the design approval team because I'm in IT and the company FINALLY figured out we need to be part of the process (after 4 other remodels in various locations).

I got the newest revision of the plans today and notice AGAIN that they didn't include a space for networking equipment so I went across the street to eh architurkey firm designing the place. I asked to speak to the architect and inquired about a centralized networking spot and he said ""we decided it won't be needed and left it out"". I stood there for a moment and then picked up my jaw off the floor and asked (in a more diplomatic term) WTF?!?!? He tried to explain that it wasn't going to be too bad we that we just needed to figure something out. I looked at the plans and there are 43 (not a typo) displays (tv with no sound) and 96 network drops. I asked about the wiring and he said ""it won't be a problem"". After some more back and forth I walked away.

Fast forward a few hours and I got my two wheeler (aka the dolly) and wheeled a full sized rack across the street and up to the architurkeys office and asked where they wanted it. Dude came out and asked what I was doing. I said ""I need a space for the equipment that is going to run the network and the displays so this is the first of 4 racks I'm bring over to hook everything up when the time comes. He starts spluttering that it can't be done like this and I say ""well sir, I've got a fiber line that runs under the street so I CAN run it over for everything"" (I know...we'd need more equipment...but he didn't lol) and I ""figured out"" where I'm going to hook everything up...HERE

FeedTheKitteh,Smoke in the koi pond,"In ages past I found myself as a priestly mage of support, second order. I resided in a cathedral of labor, present to alleviate the pains of technology from the laborers there. One vestibule of my realm was utilized by not the typical engineers who infested the land, but a bevy of receptionists, purchasers, pushers of paper, and others of the clan administrative. They occupied the second floor East, in an area surrounded on three sides with ample glass windows. Contrasting to the rambunctious silly nature of the clan engineer, these docile workers were peaceful, quiet, calm - rarely a sound beyond a softly ringing phone, muted yet brief conversations, and the gentle tap of the keys.

In short, it was a veritable koi pond, worthy of a zen destination for meditation.

As a priest of the second order I had but rare occasion to visit the oasis of peace. In the bowels of the white archcathedral of capitalism resided a cave of toil, where the lay clergy of the first order would answer the phones a-ringing to identify issues and attempt to purge the souls of the minorly inconvenienced. For all imperfections unresolvable by the first order, a ticket of routing would be dispatched to the 2nd order, some 30 miles distant, for the personal and hands-on resolution they and only they could provide.

The first order was quite occupied in their tasks, with hold times occasionally reaching some 15-20 minutes before they could speak to the troubled spirit, as what happened the day that a resident of the koi pond vocalized on the line.

&gt; I was laboring in my document of excel, a pop was heard, the screen went dark and the smoke from within the computer has been released. How can I recover my document?

To which replied the acolyte:

&gt; Lamentations, it sounds as if your computer has suffered damages physical. I shall dispatch a priest of the second order forthwith. Did you unplug your computer when the smoke did start to billow about your feet?

To which she replied:

&gt; I did not, for I have been repeatedly instructed to never simply turn off a computer without a prior click of button of start, then shutdown. When my image of computing vanished from the pane of visions I could no longer see the button of start to select the shutdown prayer and have therefore been waiting these 15 minutes to receive your guidance.

The priests of the second order were sent a urgent page of utmost priority to investigate, where they found a fried power supply, a lovely odor of burned electronics and wiring, a very passive and calm user, and a few dozen other cubicles filled with people who were not reacting to the events unfolding.",talesfromtechsupport,1300,1565698727

Back when the phones in your home were owned by the telecom a lady was having an issue where many phone calls were not coming in. The phone would not ring, BUT when the phone did ring the dog would howl first.

A lineman (technician using modern terms) was sent out to investigate. He arrived and checked the wiring.  That looked ok. He pulls out his field phone and dials the house phone. No, ringing... Then the dog howls and the house phone rings.

He goes around and finds the dog. The dog was chained to the grounding stake. The grounding stake was no in the ground far enough AND the earth was a bit dry. 

See where this is going?

fatherfatpants,That one time business supplies brought the place to a stand still,"Get a call because the POS is running slow as hell. I get in and check all the normal things; hub failure, etc etc. I then go to look at the server for these machines (this is 13 years before iPad and cloud POS became a thing).


Get on the server and it is fucked. Slow as molasses in an Antarctic winter. I walk into the room where the server was and I saw it. 4 Italian restaurant sized bags of flour on the rack above the server. I shut it down and pop the top. There was an inch or more of flour in EVERYTHING. Coolers, power supplies, the works.


I call the owner back and show him the situation. Apparently no one had ever told him that was a bad idea. I vacuum it out and then take it out back to a tire shop (it’s a shopping plaza) and use one one of their compressors to blow the remaining powder out. When I get back they had already moved the flour to another area and were working on cleaning out the room.


I hooked everything back up and the guy was super apologetic. Technically I should have billed him for it, which would have triggered upping his service contract cost, but instead I got a $200 tip (much cheaper than his expected cost) and I “swapped” a hub out as the culprit.

The contestants of this story are:

$me: me, working as an ""IT-Consultant"" though I do everything for my customers from support to consulting.

$customer: young person, not really tech-savy, works for an architectural bureau we support.

Sometime around midday my phone rings. My colleague has $customer in the line for me. She tells me $customer has some issues with a temporary profile.

$me: *usual greeting and asking what I can help with*

$customer: When I log in I get a message that I am working in a temporary profile and I have to set up Outlook again and all of my browser favorites and local files are gone.

$me: Allright I will quickly connect to your computer and see what I can do. 

I connect to her system, log in with a local admin account and open the registry to find the key that refers to her profile with .bak at the end. There is around 15 keys for different profiles but not a single one that ends in .bak. and not a single one that contains a string with $customers username.

$me: So I can't seem to find a key that contains your username. Is this you first time using this computer?

In the meanwhile I check the C:\\Users\\ directory and try to delete the folder of the temporary profile.

$customer: No I have been working on this system since January

In the exact moment she had answered me,  I reached the users folder and saw a list of ""Temp.domain.local"" folders. At first I saw 10, then I kept on scrolling and scrolling and scrolling... There were 30, 50, 70, 100, and when I reached the bottom there were 125 of them. I slowly started to realize what must have happened here...

$me: So uhh... You said you have to set up your profile again every time you log in. For how long have you been doing this?

$customer: Well I did this everyday since I started working here. At first I found it weird but I thought everybody does this every morning when they start working.

$me: You really set up your Outlook and shortcuts and stuff everyday for seven months?

$customer seemed a little embarrassed at this point, but she handled it well.

In the end what caused the issue was, that my colleague who created her profile, put in a profile-path in her AD account, even though they don't even use server-stored profiles and he even put in their old long decommissioned SBS server as the path. Probably because he cloned an old, disabled profile. After I removed the profile-path from her account, everything worked fine and $customer was no longer logged in with a temporary profile.",talesfromtechsupport,1039,1565297081
PlainIndependence,I'm the temp and you will comply!,"After my [post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/cn5jyy/the_day_an_overachieving_temp_became_a_detective/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), I had a few users asking to hear about the story I'd alluded to at the end. This takes place during a three month temp role I held working internal tech support for a wealthy international tech company. 

During my brief time there, one project I implemented was rolling all 400 employees in my office building from an old MDM (Mobile Device Manager) to the new EMM (Enterprise Mobility Manager). For those unaware, an EMM/MDM allows a company to oversee every aspect of their assets. This could be from enforcing HDD encryption, restricting web traffic, pushing out new company apps, forcing software updates, wiping the asset remotely, seeing what programs are being used, or even tracking the devices’ physical location.

It also handled the renewal of our wifi certificates; something that tended to break with our old MDM. Wifi/ethernet certs are necessary to even access the internet from inside our office building. So, if some bimbo off the street somehow made it past multiple security checkpoints and physically plugged into an office network jack, he wouldn’t be able to access anything. Unless you had an active certificate, you were completely stonewalled.

Back to the ‘forced compliance’. For this project, I needed to meet face-to-face (one-on-one) with the roughly 300 employees that weren’t yet on the new MDM. They had to plug into a very specific (unlocked) port behind my desk, so I could make a few system changes. This would take anywhere from 7min to 20min for the ones that had trouble. To organize this, I created signup sheets in our online community with hundreds of 20 minute blocks staggered every 10 minutes (across a couple weeks) and had employees signup at whatever time worked best for them.

Everyone was contacted via a batch of individual support tickets that I would eventually need to individually close. They were also contacted via internal messenger or other methods for follow up. Most everyone registered for a time slot and over the next two weeks, I was able to manually enroll hundreds of users in our new EMM. These interactions were my bread and butter, allowing me to single-handedly raise my teams KPI that quarter. 

Unfortunately, some employees were too busy (ie. important) to respond and a few even missed their scheduled appointments. Most of them were higher up in the company and could have easily terminated me (a lowly temp) if they were feeling temperamental that day. So, with my time frame on the project coming to a close, I got creative.

Going into the old MDM software, I pulled up a few of the users who were ghosting me and experimented on one by expiring their network certificates. Not ten minutes later, that ‘impossible to reach’ employee walked up to our help desk, as he was no longer able to access the internet. “Sure, I’d be glad to take a look at that connectivity issue for you.”

As there was already a certificate expiry issue with the old MDM, no one found their sudden loss of internet questionable; just annoying. More so, once they showed up for support, a member of my team took it upon themselves to enroll the employee in the new EMM. This both fixed the user's problem and allowed my team to confidently say, “this shouldn’t happen again with our new software.” 

In the end, the only employees not enrolled were all on PTO or business trips at the time. Once they got back from vacation and realized they couldn’t get on the wifi, they would need to swing by for support anyway. Win win. 

I never told anyone what I had done, as I wasn’t keen to get reprimanded, had an employee lost a sale from my actions.

TL;DR: Important employees are too busy to make a short one-on-one meeting with me so I can update their laptop. See how they like working without internet access. 

If you've yet to read it, [here is my story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/cn5jyy/the_day_an_overachieving_temp_became_a_detective/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) about catching a thief within the same company.",talesfromtechsupport,1353,1565222578
PlainIndependence,The day an overachieving temp became a detective to catch company theft,"A few moons back, I worked a temp Support Desk role for a multi-billion dollar tech company. Basically, I was covering for another employee's planed three month paid leave. When I wasn't responding to countless tickets or wrecking havoc in Active Directory, part of my role involved asset management; including MDM/DEP enrollment of hundreds of brand new assets each month- mostly laptops, phones, tablets, etc. 

Near the end of my three month stint with this amazing company, I took it upon myself to inventory the build room and clean up their hodgepodge of databases. Surprisingly, I was able to account for every Macbook listed, with the exception of one. I confirmed it wasn't out in the recent batch of repairs and should have definitely been on a shelf or in a cupboard. Checked again; nope, not there. Odd. So, to appease my OCD and craving for mystery, I decided to investigate. 

Using our help desk ticket system, I could see that a company contractor (let's call him Mr. Business) had the asset assigned to him one year prior. I reached out via messaging, where Mr. Business stated that, ""the Macbook didn't work for \[his\] software and \[he'd\] returned it to our service desk the year prior. While this story lined up with our inventory database, it didn't explain why the asset had never been reassigned and was simply marked as 'retired' the last year. Very odd. Well, more digging for me. 

With the help of our Access Management tool, (I had far too many admin privileges as a temp) I was able to determine that this missing laptop was accessed about 6 months *after* it had supposedly been returned to inventory. I could see what programs were used at that time, how long the laptop had been booted, and what networks were connected. The user whom had signed in at boot with his credentials was also logged: Mr. Business. 

He booted it again a few days later, for only a few minutes; making it easy to guess the Macbook had been wiped at that time. Pulling up our network logs, I determined that this asset had not pinged our internal network for around 10 months, which correlated with the unknown IP he had logged. 

So, the picture painted was this: Mr. Business, who made well into six figures, borrowed a laptop that (for whatever reason) he failed to return. Instead, he decided to risk his career (well, at least his honor?) by lying about it and bringing the Macbook home with him- where it sat undisturbed for six months. Like a grade A genius, he booted it, connected it to his home wifi, and used it for one day- before wiping its memory. 

Mr. Business was in the clear, until months later, a brown nosed kid decided to be an overachiever in a temp roll and clean up a few databases, to leave a good impression. I ended up compiling some irrefutable proof this guy was guilty. 

No clue what came from it or if Mr. Business even still works for this company. I passed on what I'd found to my boss and knew better than to ask questions about how it was handled. Wasn't my place. 

Anticlimactic, I know. Thanks for reading anyway.

TL;DR: A well paid business man stole a company laptop; then lied to myself and others about stealing it. Bad businessman, bad.

SysAdmin907,"""I don't think you have enough rank to work on my computer""","Back story- In the army working as a computer tech. Windows NT 4.0 and Office 97 time frame. I get a call from the boss (colonel) to go down and load Office 97 on another colonel's computer. Was this story insubordinate? Most likely. Did he deserve this? oooh yes he did.

I go down to the colonel's office to do the software install. I knock on his door and announce that COL. ""cool boss"" sent me down to install Office 97 on his computer. He pauses. Looks me up and down and says ""Where's major ""other cool boss""?"" I tell him that he's busy and can't make it down. The he asks where's COL ""cool boss"".. ""He's busy and he sent me down to do the install"". The colonel thinks about this for a second and says ""I was expecting someone with more rank"". ""Well.. Both are busy. If you like, you can wait a couple weeks to get it installed"" I replied. Being a grouchy old colonel, he replies back ""Oh.. Ok... I suppose I can let a sergeant work on my computer"".. He gets up and allows me to sit down at his desk to work the install. I install the package and walk out, report back to the boss it's done and move on.

Fast forward 8 months later..

I get assigned a work order from LTC ""I don't think you have enough rank"". He is moving between commands. He wishes to move his documents down to the computer that he'll be using in his new office. I look at the work order, remember the slam I received and decide to write a nice document up (with color pictures) of how to create a share on the new computer, how to locate that computer on ""network neighborhood"" and how to copy/paste his documents from his old computer to the new one. I send this set of directions back to the good colonel and closed the work order.  A week later, this same work order shows up again. I took the directions I sent him, condensed it down to the ""readers digest"" version, send it back and close the work order. Week later, same work order. Send an email referring to the last two documents and close the work order again.

A couple days later..  I run into the good colonel in the hall way...

""Say SGT.. I submitted work orders to move my documents from my old computer to my new one and they keep getting canceled.""

Me- Sir, did you read the emails and read the documents with pictures and directions to facilitate this..?

LTC- Yes, but it was just complex and complicated.

Me- continue to walk down the hall way and onto my next trouble ticket.

We would send ""the boys"" (junior enlisted) out to do the day-to-day tickets, whereas I was a ""janitor"", who would go into an office and blanket fix everything in that office and move to the next. I was in the middle of a clean up job when I get a ticket for another unit demanding high-pri assistance. I call the user that put the ticket in and ask that he hold on for 2 more days while I finish up the job I'm working on now. He'd furious! I blow off his attitude and finish up the job I was working on. 

I showed up to his office, told him to crank out a list of issues (to include the one on the ticket) and I'll make it happen.  At first, he was pissed that I did not show up instantly when he put the ticket in. This was a major clean-up and install operation. Several new computers, 20 new printers, 3 flatbed scanners, various user issues. I spent the next 5 days hammering out IP address allocations, system installs, software installs, profile moves, resolving user issues and teaching users how to use their new flat bed scanners. EVERTHING was DONE. (I don't like having to make repeat visits after a clean up, it means I did not do my job correctly)

The last day I was there, I went back to Mr. ""impatient"" with his list. Everything was checked off to include problems that were not on it. He was happier than pie and was showering me with atta boys. After he was done, I said ""remember that ticket you put in and wanted it done right now? Then got mad when I asked you to hold off a couple days?"" His face went sheepish and started looking at everything but me.  ""Yeah, I remember."" he said in a low voice.  ""Well..

OP - ""Hey M, just had someone on phone that thinks we have a crystal ball for all their problems.""
M - :smh: ""Yeah, heard the tail end of that. Besides, our ouija board is broken.""
OP - *chuckle* ""Yep.""

Needless to say we shipped replacement label printer and a few weeks later they finally ship us the broken printer back.

Turns out they put the labels in upside-down jamming it and the thermal ribbon was backwards too. That was a mess to fix.

Also, an apology letter, about her rude comments, was stuffed in the bottom of the box to try and hide it.

This isn't the first time, nor will it be the last for those of us in IT. 

Coworker bought an 8 ball to give advice to those seeking a crystal ball response from us a few days later. Definitely some amusement from that since we'd tried to add the results to our phone conversations.",talesfromtechsupport,726,1564970128
iamcorvin,The internet hates my wife.,"This happened many years ago when the internet was newish to consumers and people were still using dial up to access it.

I was working for a PC manufacturer in a call centre as a second level support agent.  I took an escalation call that had been passed on by another L2 agent who was at his wits end.

&gt;Husband: the internet works fine for me but not for my wife.  Every time she goes to use it, it disconnects.

Previous techs had tried all the basics, but no love from the internet for her.  Even if he left it connected the minute she sat down to use the computer it would disconnect.

Eventually, I was reminded of another client who couldn't use the internet between 3pm - 6pm and 5am - 7am.  That was because that's when his neighbors electric fence was turned on and the cheap modems that we were shipping were so sensitive to outside RF interference that the fence was enough to prevent his modem from connecting, we resolved that by shipping a hardware modem instead of the usual soft modem.

So, I started digging into the situation.  Was anything electric running that she was using that her husband wasn't?  I was thinking maybe an electric wheelchair, turns out I was close.  She had a prosthetic arm that had some kind of motor in it to open and close the hand, that was enough to knock out the modem.  Solution was to send a hardware modem, after that the internet stopped hating his wife.",talesfromtechsupport,1743,1564882871
vnangia,Bad user or bad UI - you choose!,"Setting: a call center, probably. The phone rings.

$tech quickly sees $user has been with the company for quite a while. Very few calls in nearly a dozen years of employment - almost all IT service requests that IT had to do, one call during the Great VPN Outage of 2016, a marked ""no-fuss user.""

$tech: ""And may I know who I'm speaking to?""

$user: ""Sure it's $user.name.""

$tech: ""Okay, $user.name, how can I help you today?""

$user: ""So, our management is asking us to create a new milestone in the portal for a project so that we can add some supporting documentation and mark it as completed. When I go to the portal, open up the project and go to the milestones section, I can edit the existing milestones or delete them, I can't add any.""

$tech: ""And I take it you've done the basic troubleshooting - have you reopened the project in the portal and reopened the browser?""

$user: ""And tried it in Chrome and Edge and cleared the cache and tried in private mode.""

$tech: ""Hmmm, maybe it's a permissions issue, are you marked as being on the project team?""

$tech scrolls down and sees at the bottom of the milestones list the ""+ Add milestones"" button. 

$tech: ""And this button doesn't work?""

$user facepalms loudly enough to be audible through the phone and groans. $tech bursts into laughter.

$user: ""Sorry, I was looking up at the top because when you create the project, there's an 'Add' button there. I'm so so sorry, the problem is the user is an idiot.

$tech: _still giggling_ ""No problem sir, you're very much a 'no-fuss user' - I can see you've only ever called for IT service requests and during the VPN outage a few years ago. So no problem.

SatansAdvokat,I had firemen kick down a door to save a mans life.,"This was in 2013, and i was a complete rookie at my job, i had worked as a tech support for maybe 3 months when a call rolled in and i answered.

Me: Hello! This is OP how can i help you?

An old man answered with h-h-hello?
He sounded like he was 200 years old or had some disability that cause his speach to become stuttering and mumbled.

Me: Yes hi! You're talking to OP at \*Company\* support.
How may i help you?

Old man: *incoherent noises* phones not working.....*more incoherent noises*... 

Note: the incoherent noises were not disturbances in the call but rather something he did, like rolling around his tounge in his mouth. Giving me an impression he was not 100% healthy from the start. 

Me: Do you have a problem with your phone? Can you give me the number to the affected phone?

He gave me the number and i started to troubleshoot. He was about 56 years old and I didn't find any problems. 

Me: What kind of problem are you experiencing? 

Old man: *incoherent noises*... I.... I can not call.... 

Me: So you cannot make any calls? 

Old man: mmhm... *incoherent noises*

Me: What happens when you try to make a call? 

Old man: pfffffhhhnnnnn iiiiii cant rrRRRrreach mme me me me my b b.... Rother r r r. 

At this point i starter to think that he have had a stroke at some point. 

Me: I understand, so when you're trying to reach your brother what happens then? 

Old man: *incoherent noises*.... Dott... Doottt.. Dot.. It sounds. 

Me: Aha, is it a fast doting sound or slow? 

Old man: ssssssSSS S ll l loow, slow. 

I thought the number he is trying to dial was wrong or something has happened to the number. 

Me: which number has your brother? 

Tge old dude could not say, or i didnt understand at this point. So i asked for his name. 

I got his name and searched him in our system, i found him and tried to make a call. 

Old mans brother: Hello? 

Me: This is OP from \*Company\*, its about old man. 

Old mans brother: Has something happened? 

Me: Well he says he cannot reach you but his phone seems to work. 

Old mans brother: well so what you can about it. 

We talked for a bit and i found out that he indeed have had a stroke and that he is reliant on his phone to be able to call his brother and the hospital. I got back the the old man. 

Me: Hello! Thank you for your patience. I got hold of your brother so his number seems to be working. 

Old man: I i i n n nnnneeed to call m m y brother! 

He sounded distressed all of a sudden. 

Me: I understand, can you just try to call him again, and please repeat the numbers you dial so i can confirm that it is correct. 

Old man: HNNNN m most c c ch call brother!! 

Now he seems very stressed. 

Me: Is it something urgent? Do you need me to call him? 

Old man now shouting: HHHHHOOOSBITAL.... (i heard something hit the floor). 

Me now freaking out: Hello? hello?! Are you there? 
I was thinking what the F? Did he just fall?! A heart attack?!! 

I maxed out the sound on the headset, the call was still ongoing and i could hear a faint breathing.

Me: Hello?! Can you hear me? Are yiu conscious? 
He did not answer... 

I freaking out, a light panic gripped me and i froze like a deer in the headlights. I could not think straight. 
I called his brother because idk, maybe he knew what just happened. (panic)

Me: Hi again this is OP. I was just in a call with your brother and all of a sudden he became stressed out and yelled hospital and then i think he fainted. He seemed to want to cone in contact with you? Do you know what just happened? 

Old mans brother: Oh dear.. I think he just might have had a stroke again, the doctors had warned about this. I cannot check on him im 10 miles away! 

Me freaking out even more: We must get an ambulance! 

Old mans brother: Ofc we do! But i don't know his exact adress! 

Me: i have all of the information infront of me. I can call them. 

So i called the emergency number and asked for an ambulance to the customers adress, they asked me to hold the line with them and the old man if i heard him stop breathing and keep trying to contact him. 

The police and ambulance came to the customers door and tried to open the door after failed communication attempts. 10 minutes after i called the emergency number the old dudes breath became irregular and weaker, i told them that and the freaking firemen came and broke down hus door with heavy duty equipment!! 

I heard how they found him and tried to talk to him, and how they moved him around. 
I heard them saying that they have to take him to the emergency room at the hospital and brought a stretcher to lay him down on and carry him to the ambulance. 

I just sat there on my butt like :O the whole time untill the woman from the emergency number told me that we could hang up. 

After that i called the brother and told him what had happened. He was very upset and i heard his voice crack a little bit. He told me to call him tomorrow and we hung up. 

I had no freaking idea what to do. Am i in trouble? i thought. I told like EVERYONE at the office what happened and all of them encouraged me to contact the brother the day after. Which i then did. 

I was nervous and kinda scared when i called. I didn't know how to act because i was not in a situation i had traning for or had ever experienced. 

The brother picked up and immediately shined up in the voice when i introduced me. 

He said that he could not thank me enough for what i did. And that i probably saved his brothers life. 
He actually had a stroke!! He went unconscious and hit his head on the livingroom table in the fall. Luckily it caused minor damage, and his brother had woken up and was alive.
He told me that he would personally call my boss to have a talk with her and tell her to give me a raise, lol. 
I was completely humbled during the entire length of the call, i could barely utter words.

I didn't get the raise but... i got my face printed out and put up in the cafeteria with the text ""Super supporten som räddar liv"" Which means the ""The super supporter that saves lives"". And i fine with that... I barely wanted to think about if he didn't survive, or if i passed him off like a wierdo and hung up! Just to let him lay there and die... 


Nothing like this has ever happened to anyone i know, even after 6 years in the tech support. I don't know if i was unlucky or that it was luck.

Sputtrosa,Remote that doesn't work when wife is home,"I was working for a TV distributor with both cable and dish channels. They had their own brand of TV box/decoders.

When the customer in question called in and started by saying that I had to believe him, I knew it was going to be a great call. The log showed he had called several times before.

Customer: When my wife is at home, the remote control to the decoder doesn't work.

Me: Yes, it does, but I'll hear you out.

Inner Me: I bet she takes the batteries.

Customer: Your colleagues all guessed that she takes the batteries..

Inner Me: Darn it.

Customer: ..but she doesn't! I can be holding the remote control and it works fine. She comes home and ten minutes later it doesn't work any more. I haven't let go of the control, and even tried changing batteries when it stopped working just to be sure, but it doesn't make a difference.

We go back and forth for a long time, thinking of different things that could be an issue. He's being nice about my inability to help him, and though I started out thinking he's just another customer who thinks that the reply to ""Did you check if the cable is connected properly?"" is always ""Yes, I did, I even tried five different cables."", even though they didn't, I quickly realise he's tech-savvy and we discard a dozen theories.

In the end, we solved it.

When his wife got home, she pulled the cartains apart to let in light, and the sunlight was directly on the IR reciever, interfering with the remote control. When his wife left, he pulled the curtains to see the TV better. They'd tried to lower production cost of the new line of decoders, so the dark plastic in front of the IR reciever was just that - dark plastic instead of a filter to block other light. Figuring that out was the most satisfying tech support moment I've had.",talesfromtechsupport,3878,1564662205
SatansAdvokat,How DARE you give me free cancer?!,"Hello! So this is my very first story i have ever posted here and if i have done anything wrong in the storytelling please let me know. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working in IT customer service for some years now and I have had my fair share of crazy and stupid people.

&amp;#x200B;

This story is from a couple of years ago in 2014.  
I was working for my country's biggest ISP as a customer tech supporter, i was mainly helping people with wired internet. Fiber optics and copper cable aswell as home phones and TV.

The company gives a free router to almost all our internet customers that even has a thunder warranty.  
Before the company had that deal the customers got a simple modem. This will become important later.

&amp;#x200B;

So i was there answering the phone to one lady late at a friday night about 18:30 o'clock.

  
Me: Hello! My name is OP how can i help you?

Lady: About time! do you know how long i have been in queue? why is the queue so long? don't you have enough staff or are you all just lazy? (She was one of those, i did a mental sighs and mustered my regular nice service voice)

Note: She had this VERY obnaxius tone in her voice and we very rude.

Me: I apologize about the queue time, there has been a major disturbance at a station so alot of people are calling in at the moment. But how may i....(i was interrupted)

Lady: I don't care about your excuses! My internet is incredibly slow and my phone has this annoying scraping sound in it! it has been this way since 3 months ago!! Why havent you done anything about it?!

Me: I understand, i am sorry that you have experienced a slow internet connection for some time but its important to let us know about that sooner so we can help you. Let me just run a few analytics. (The analisys showed a diversion in the cable, a problem that commonly is caused by units connected home at the customer). I proceeded to tell her: The analytics show me a problem that causes your experienced problem, i need to run a few tests to find exactly where this problem is.

Lady: ""She huffs"". Well okay i can wait but make it quick, i don't have all day! and staying in a call like this makes me feel sick! (Me thinking: Wait.. sick?)

Me: How nice of you to help, together we can locate and fix the problem i am sure of it. I need you to pull out all of your units from the internet sockets so i can run the same analisys again to see if i get a different result. But before we do that i need to borrow you mobile phone number so i we can proceed the call from there.

Reluctantly and ranting under her breath she gave me her number and we proceeded the call over the MB.  
She pulled out all the stuff and the troubleshooting showed that her old modem was the cause of the problem.  
I explained to her that she needed a new one and that its no longer in stock because at the time that modem was over 7 years old. 

Lady: What do you mean its not in stock?! i want a new one now!

Me: It means that the modem has expired from our stock, it is no longer avalible, but we have another free product that we can give to you in its stead.

Lady: Mhm fine, i sure hope you can send it to me so i have it by tomorrow.

Me: I am afraid that sending this new product to you in such a short notice is impossible due of how the postal service operates. But it will come to the nearest postal service location within 2-3 workdays!

Well now she became out of nowhere really mad.  
She proceeded to loudly yell at me.

Lady: NO you will send it to me, to MY mailbox by tomorrow NOT to the postal service office!! I don't care how you do it and i expect not to having to pay anything! this is the least thing you can do for me after making we having to endure such a bad internet connection for 3 months and having me call you and wait in a queue for 30 minutes then do YOUR work so we can find the problem! You WILL make what's nessessary so that i can have it by tomorrow.

At this point getting quite upset having her attitude showed in my ear for now about 20 minutes and now she starts screaming at the person helping her?

Me really trying to sound nice: Miss, as i said, that is impossible, and we cannot know if your internet is behaving if we never get a notice from you who uses the internet, i can send... (interrupted again)

Lady: I said i don't CARE how you make it work!!! JUST MAKE IT WORK!

Me: That. is. impossible, i would send it to your mailbox so you would get it by tomorrow if i could. You live approximatly 400km from our storage facility, where the product is sent from and its friday 19 (something) o'klock now. You can expect your package to the nearest postal service location next tuesday or wednesday.

Lady: WHAT?! So i will have to wait 4-5 days for it?! This is the worse service ever! \*Company\* has SUCH a bad customer service!!! (\*Company\* actuarly has the country's best customer service and best waittime for issue resolvement)

Me at the moment had enough of her banchee screetching: Yes. You will have to wait for the package to be delivered.

Lady: Ugh... (Went silent for about 5s) I guess we will get nowhere with that..

Me: No, i am sorry that you will have to wait. But i asure you that the new product will solve your problem.

lady, somehow now calm?: What exactly is this new product? 

Me, quite confused by her complete 180: Eugh... its a router that \*company\* gives away for free to all out internet customers as a free rental product.

Lady, again screaming but now completely livid: WHAT?! you're sending ME a router?!  
HOW DARE YOU?! Don't you know how dangerus those things are?!! i am ALLERGIC TO RADIO SIGNALS!!!

Me quite stunned by the next 720 turn in the conversation again: Eh.. Well if you're feeling unconftible with the wifi running, i can turn it of for you.

Lady, even more angry... how that by this point is even possible: YOU, Y-YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER MY ROUTER?!!!

Me: Well technically its not your router, you borrow it during the time you have inter... (interrupted)

Lady: THOSE THINGS ARE DANGERUS AND DEADLY, how can \*Company\* send out those things FOR FREE when you KNOW how dangerus they are?! do you WANT people to get CANCER?!!!

Me: Lady... i assure you that our router meets the european standard wifi regulation.   
(Silence except for breathing).

Me: The wifi signal outmitted by thi... (interrupted)

Lady: WIFI IS CANCER and cause all manners of sickness! young boy, i am educated and I know ALLOT more than you about these things, i have been reachearching this.  
Me, now quite fed up with her BS and no longer gives one F: Oh, if you have knowlage about this? then you should know that the radio signal outmitted by our router is at standard 2.4Ghz and that radiosignal is non ionizing. Meaning that the radiosignal does not carry enough energy to excite the electrons in the molecules that builds your DNA enough be flung away from the molecule and damage your DNA structure to cause cellular damage. This signal cannot cause cancer. 

Lady: YOU LIE! (She did not try to correct me) And i want you NOT to send me that POISONBOX!  
you will have to send me a modem instead!

Me: I'm afraid i can't do that.  
What i just offered you for free as a sulotion to your problem is what we hand out. IF you do not want it, you can feel free to buy your own product from anywhere. Just note that if you do \*Company\* has no support over the product you have bought outside our company as a sulotion not provided by the ISP to a problem that could have been fixed with \*company\* products.

Lady: So you are now FORCING me to BUY a product at another \*company\* to have my internet work?!

Me: Noone is forcing you, you could have our router for free and let me turn of the wifi. but you denied it and want a product that is no longer avalible.

Lady: I will make you the headline of the newspaper, i will report you to the polise for fraud and have you fired!! You are giving away CANCER FOR FREE!  WHAT. IS. YOUR. NAME?! (I gave her my name at the start of the call, but i guess she forgot)

Me: I do not feel comfortable telling you my name. but you can call be Robert (Far from my actual name)

Lady: Do the people at \*Company\* know who ""Robert"" is?

Me: No.

Lady: Wh... what?! WHAT?!

Me: If you want us to send you the free product to solve your problem, feel free to call us again.

Lady: NO I..(Klick)  


I think the call duration was about 45 minutes in total and during the time she allways complained about something, it was me, the company, the service, our methods of work and our systems.

  
After the call i told my boss what have happened and she was supportive and told me that i should have hung up sooner than i did and was proud of me for trying to help that nasty customer. She told me that she have overheard some of it and that i did it good.

pukui7,Password confusion,"Here's another short tale that didn't happen all that long ago.

One of our locations handles payments.  We use Square on a tablet mostly but the manager there also logs in occasionally via PC to check reports, etc.

One day, I updated the passwords and business was as usual.  No problems with the tablet.  However that afternoon, she calls me in a panic because she can't log in via the PC.  I remind her about the password change but she is adamant that she's typing it correctly.

I log in remotely and it's all working fine.  She's frustrated but thanks me and does whatever she needed to do.

The next day, the same thing happens so I go visit her in person.  I ask her to show me and sure enough, it doesn't work.  I watch her type it in and see it fail.

Then I try it and it works.  Huh?

I log out and ask her to type it slowly while I watch closely... and Aha!  I see exactly what is going wrong.

She does most of her work on mobile.  The password has a few capital letters and on the PC, she was hitting the shift key and then letting it go before typing the letter.

That's what you do on mobile.

LALLANAAAAAA,Ticket closed. Reason: scale actually router.,"One of my IT jobs was client-facing phone support for a company who supplied consumer and business PC postage solutions. We sold scales too so people could weigh their shit.

This is an account of my favorite call. 

Entities: Me, Caller, Company.

*Auto-attendant beeps

Me: Hello, this is Me, thanks for calling Company, what can I help you with? 

Caller: I can't get this scale to weigh anything. You guys sold me this scale and I need it for my business. I'm going to cancel this account because your product sucks.

Me: Yikes, OK, let's see what we can find. Is it connected to both power and the computer?

Caller: Yes, both, I just traced the wires and I see blinking lights. I know it's connected right.

Me: OK, great. Let's validate app and driver status.

[Remote in: Nothing wrong found in settings. Customer removes item, replaces item on scale: 0 action.]

Me: Huh.  Can you find any identifying information on the scale so I can look up the KB for this model? A model or revision number?

Caller: Well it's gray, square, flat, plastic, has a power cable and another cable that goes to the computer. It doesn't have a readout but it does have blinking lights. I have a heavy box on it RIGHT NOW and the computer isn't reading it. Are you sure you know what you're doing?

Me, politely: Are you sure it's our scale? There are third party scales which might not be compatible.

Caller, not politely: YES ITS YOURS I PAID EXTRA FOR IT 

Me: OK, well let's get that model number. It's on the back [describes location]

Caller, even less politely: IT'S NOT THERE. I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

Me: Let's back up. What words are written on the back?

Caller: [pause] Link System.

Caller: Yes, Linksys. That's who made this scale.

Me, calm as you like: Can I place you on a brief hold? I need to verify something. Thanks.

Caller: [mortified soul death sounds, shameful weeping]

Ghost7579ox,This call broke my heart,"This story happened many years ago when I was working at a multi media company in customer services.
Back story: this was a recent career change, as I used to be self employed and spent most of my adult life working in manual labour, so being sat at a desk listening to customers bitch about their crappy WiFi or TiVo not working was very new to me.

Cast: 

Me: whoever that is?

SW: sweet woman 

The call comes through and I say my usual script “ hello my name is....”and ask her for her account number 

Sw: ( in a very sweet shy voice) I’m so sorry I don’t know it, my husband usually does these kind of calls.

ME: that’s ok madam, I just need to ask a few questions to make sure that it’s your account.

She agrees and answers all questions perfectly, 

Me: so what can I help you with today?

I say trying to sound cheerful, as I usually love talking to the old dears, and making them laugh just to put a smile on their faces.

SW sounds very upset and I could hear her almost crying on the phone, she collects herself and says, SW: I’m afraid that my husband has passed away and I don’t know what to do with the new account.

What had happened was that when her husband passed, she called our company to change the name on the account from her husbands to herself, and due to a glitch in the order, the system thought she was a new customer and was being billed as one as well as still being charged for the old account and was being charged late fees, as well as being charged a month in advance for being a new customer.
But that’s not all, she was also charged for moving home.

As I’m looking at this monumental cluster fuck of an account, I see what her bill was supposed to be £20 per month for a phone line, it was now over £200! WTF.

As this is being told to me and I’m seeing it in front of me, i can hear the poor SW crying on the phone, she only had a tiny state pension to live on, how the hell was she going to pay for this bill?

ME: oh my god!...ok, let me tell you the good news first.

SW: alright.

ME: I’m sure I can get rid of most of the charges, the bad news is I’m going to need you to hold the line for quite a while as I deal with all the departments involved.

Note: I cannot call her back as the system automatically switches the account as soon as the call ends.

I then spend the best part of an hour talking to my manager, the credit department,retentions and the moving department, AT THE SAME TIME! On multiple lines all the while I’m still talking to SW.

Finally after talking to all those different departments for nearly an hour and missing my lunch break, I got back on the call.

ME: hi, I’m back again.

SW: oh, hello... did you manage to do anything?

She was such a sweetheart and was so patient with me.

ME: yes I did, ( I say like I’ve just conquered a nation ) your husbands account has now been shut down and all charges have been erased, I got my manager to refund the advance charge on the new account as you are not a new customer, I got the moving team to refund you the moving charge and I took care of the late fees, so now you’re direct debit is back to £20 per month as usual.

SW: oh that’s amazing, thank you so very much.

ME: it was my pleasure and once again I am so sorry about this ( I apologised a lot throughout the call).

After that, her son comes on the phone and firstly thanked me for getting her account settled, and then payed her bill for that moth, so in the end the £200 bill that she was looking at turned into absolutely nothing.

This call really hit me hard because I had lost both my parents earlier that year, and just like SW my dad had everything in his name and my mum didn’t have a clue what to do.

Thanks for reading.

IC: No, there is a password here on the email and it’s not working. I even tried to copy and paste it in and it’s still not working.

Me: I’ve not changed anything, I don’t even know your employee ID. We’re also not allowed to do that over the phone.

IC: Why did they put a password for me to enter then? It was very confusing.

Me: I’m not sure, the database keeps what’s sent to you confidential. What word was there in the password field out of interest?

IC: Oh, I’m not sure how to read it it. It looks very technical, I’ll have to spell it out. It says open square bracket U-S-E-A-D-M-I-N-P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D, then close square bracket.

AVeryMadFish,I made a regrettable mistake on family vacation...,"I feel like such a dumb-ass for letting this happen...

So, my uncle bought a beach house on the east coast and organized a large family vacation, to which my wife and I were invited.  Hell yeah! We're going to the beach! The house is HUGE, and every room is decked out with wall mounted TVs, DVD players, and Roku sticks for video streaming.  

The biggest downside is definitely my neurotic, antisocial, suuuper needy aunt (lets call her Nancy), who clearly has no social graces or sense of personal boundaries, and zero chill...she reminds me of folks I've met who have Asperger's or mild Autism except, in her case, dial the ""neurotic and annoying"" meter to 11 and you've got my aunt Nancy. She decides that she's going to spend this whole vacation flitting about, working on and stressing out over every single little item at the property in need of repair.  This includes appliances, furniture and, yep you guessed it, electronics.  She was going to stress and freak over this stuff for the entire 9-day vacation, though at first I did not realize this...

So we arrive and begin to unpack, greeting our family members as they come in and getting a feel for the place we'll be staying.  Nancy tries to switch on the living room TV, but the remote isn't working.  It turns out the Roku remote needed to be re-paired with the TV.  It's a simple fix; I offer to check it out and get it working in short order.  And then, my friends, I uttered the thing I would regret for the next 9 days...I couldn't stop myself...it all happened so fast...

I turned to my Aunt Nancy and (oh you poor, ignorant fool) I said to her those accursed words that would haunt me for weeks to come.  I look her right in the eyes and I say:

This just happened today. the company I work for does IT support and installations of biometric access (fingerprint readers, photo id badges, access cards) and CCTV systems and different software packages for different needs (door access, time and attendance, etc) but the license on one of the time and attendance programmes we supplied a branch of one of our biggest clients (smallest company we service is about 10 to 12, largest is several thousand spread throughout South Africa and Southern Africa) is about to expire and each user of this program has to email us once we've sent each user steps, in super clear instructions that even my young daughter can understand, how to get the 'activation request file' just so that we can pass it along to our supplier of the program to supply us with the activation code. Below is a briefed up version of the chain of emails between ME and Jack\* (not persons name)

&amp;#x200B;

Me - Good day there Jack\*, my name is willbeonekenobi from &lt;my company name&gt; and according to our records, &lt;Time and Attendance&gt; software is about to expire (14 days left on your install) on your pc. I will need for you to follow the steps below to send me the activation request file that is unique to your pc.

1. Open program and log in

2. Click on 'Configuration' then scroll to 'Registration'

3. Click on 'Save Activation Request File' button. Save this file to your desktop.

4. Reply to this email with just the file that you just created as an attachment.

Jack - Good day willbeonekenobi. For past few days I've been getting this error message that is in the picture (attachment is a pdf of a printed photo from a potato camera showing that the program is about to expire and will need to re-activate soon)

&amp;#x200B;

Me - That attached picture is why I am asking you to follow the steps in my first email (the one you replied to) as the program is going to expire in 14 days.

&amp;#x200B;

(25 minutes later)

&amp;#x200B;

Jack - Where in the first email are the steps you want me to do? Why can't you do them?

tunaman808,But... WHY did you click that?,"One of my biggest clients has two offices: a home office about 10 miles away and a remote office 175 miles away. 

The home office is run like any ""proper"" business of its size: Ubiquiti networking gear, a Windows domain, multiple backups to external hard drives and the cloud, Dell 3060 Micros for the users, Office 365 Business Premium, etc. And I have these users trained pretty well: they're good about rebooting their computers first, about calling me before opening sketchy emails, about writing down (or screencapping) error messages. Pretty much the best you could hope for from non-technical folks.

The remote office, on the other hand, is treated like the red-headed stepchild. They used to get the home office's hand-me-down PCs (when I took over IT in 2004 one user was still using a Pentium 266! No, that's not a joke). They don't have a server 'cos they don't need one. They're using an Archer C9 router 'cos it was cheap and ""good enough"". And since the only user-specific app on their PCs is Outlook, I have them logging in as COMPANYUSER with the same password. The ""same password"" thing was an explicit request of the owner, but the same user was my idea - if someone leaves the company, all I have to do is uninstall Office 365 and OneDrive, disconnect the old O365 account from Windows and reinstall Office 365 and OneDrive for the new employee. It's not perfect by any means, but since the office is a three hour drive (and there's no real reason for them to have individual profiles) it works.

Or, at least, it did. A user left recently, so I removed her Office\OneDrive install and reinstalled it for the new user. It seemed to work fine on my end. Until Thursday, when I got a text from the office manager up there. She said the new user ""couldn't save any files"" and it ""looked like the computer has been wiped!"" She said that she ""needed this fixed ASAP!""

One problem with that office is that its understaffed. More than once its taken a whole day to do a fix an issue that ideally should only take 20-30 minutes... because users will get a customer or phone call, and it'll take them 45 minutes to get back to their computers. Then they'll go to lunch, even if I ask them to wait, 'cos it'll only take a few more minutes if they'll stick around for a couple minutes. So, despite asking for help ""ASAP"", it took 35 minutes to finally get in touch with the office manager.     

I accessed the computer remotely and found Adobe Reader wouldn't save a file because it was locked up. So I ended the task, and noticed the OneDrive wasn't running... in fact, it looked like it had been uninstalled. So I installed it for the new user and set up file protection, because if anyone needs it, it's this office. After that, I asked the office manager (OM) to show me what was wrong.

&gt;OM: ""Well, look at this!"" 

[she opens the Documents folder, which is empty except for the default folders and some RDP files they use to connect to the home office] 

&gt;OM: ""There's NOTHING here! It's like it was wiped! There should be HUNDREDS of documents here! This office DEPENDS on these documents! We are literally DEAD IN THE WATER without them!""

&gt;Me: ""Well, [old user] didn't use the Documents folder. She kept everything on the desktop. Here, look..""

[There are only, like, four folders on the desktop; I open one to reveal *hundreds* of documents and templates; I then open another folder to show OM hundreds *more* documents and templates]

&gt;OM: ""Well, OK. That's a relief! But the computer still won't let us save files!""

[I open Excel, type some gibberish and save the file to the desktop. It works. I open an existing Word doc, type ""THIS IS A TEST"" at the top and save it as EDIT-[FILENAME.DOCX]. That works, too.]

&gt;OM: ""No, not Office! Reader!""

&gt;Me (annoyed at her ""not Office, you idiot!"" tone): ""Why don't you show me the problem.""

She opened Reader, and I watched as a box popped-up that said something like ""We recovered one of your documents from a program crash. Do you want to restore it?"" Before I could even finish reading the textbox, OM clicked NO. She then clicked through the recent items and File &gt; Open dialog. 

&gt;OM: ""See? I spent HOURS working on this PDF with [new user] and now it's GONE. I can't find it ANYWHERE! WHERE IS IT???""

&gt;Me, dumbfounded: ""Why in the world did you click 'No' on that box that popped up when you opened Reader?""

&gt;OM: ""Oh, I never read those things!""

&gt;Me: ""Well, I couldn't read the whole thing since you clicked ""No"" so quickly, but it said that it recovered a document from a crash, and asked if you wanted to restore it. That was almost certainly the document you spent HOURS working on.. and it saved a copy for you.. and you clicked 'No, I don't want that file.' So now it's gone.""

gingershibboleet,The ultimate protection for usb sticks. Who needs backups anyway?,"I just remembered this special interaction I've had. It has become my number one tale to scare my users into backing up their files and I thought I'll share it with you. Excuse any grammar erros, english is not my first langauge.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a couple of years ago, I was fresh out of my apprenticeship in my first real job at a big university in Central Europe. My team consisted of 6 people, every one of us has a couple of faculties to support. We also have a help desk, that routes calls from those faculties to the right supporter and that answer the general problems from students.

&amp;#x200B;

At that time, my faculty was the law faculty. Now, law professors are a special breed, on par with doctors in their God complex. But everyone knows the secretaries are the people that actually run this joint and even the profs are scared of angering them.

To make my life easier I made a point to befriend them. This was made easier by the fact that I am their first female supporter and they were so fascinated by this, that they regularly invited me for their daily coffee and cake breaks.

That also meant they sometimes ask me for things that I'm strictly speaking not allowed to provide.

&amp;#x200B;

Enough of backstory, let's get to the story

$me = obviously

$HD = student that works in help desk and routes/screens calls

$favSec = my favorite secretary, was a sweetheart but not very computer savvy. Had to explain her a lot of things again and again, but she reigned in her professor for me, so I didn't mind

$PhD = student working for $favSec and simultaneously working on her dissertation. Not computer savvy either. Manages to hard shutdown her computer during updates EVERY SINGLE TIME.

&amp;#x200B;

It's 1pm, I'm watching the clock tick by and contemplate what I did wrong in my life to end up in the public sector with a boring job that every monkey can do in an infrastructure that is stuck in the 80s.

&amp;#x200B;

The phone rings, a frantic $HD is on the other end

\&gt; $HD: ""Oh good, you're in. I have $favSec on the phone for you, but she doesn't want to tell me what's the problem. And there is someone crying in the background.""

\&gt;$Me: ""OK, just give me the call, I'll see what they have done now."" - ""Hello $favSec, this is $Me, what can I do for you today?""

\&gt; $favSec: ""Oh thank God, you're in today. I know you're not allowed support private usb sticks, but this is really REALLY important. $PhD can't see her usb stick on the PC anymore.""

&amp;#x200B;

The crying in the background get's louder. Please, tell me it's not what I think it is...

I normally would tell them to drop of the usb stick and I'll get to it in the next couple days. But it's a slow day and I think we all know where this story is going.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$Me: ""Well, I won't garantuee anything, but I'll come and take a look at it.""

\&gt;$favSec to $PhD: ""Dont worry, $Me is coming and will get it working again.""

(Thanks lady, nothing like a little pressure to save the day)

&amp;#x200B;

I inform my boss of the impending fiasco and make my way to the law faculty building. As I enter their floor, I see secretaries like meerkats popping out of their door and just as fast disappearing again. That seems slightly ominous.

I get to the office of $PhD and see $favSec wringing her hands and another student worker consoling a crying $PhD.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$Me: ""so, what's the problem exactly?""

\&gt;$PhD: ""I came in this morning, put in the usb stick and I can't see it! It has my dissertation on it!!! I have to submit it next week!!!""

Motherf\*\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I take a look at it and sure enough, nothing in explorer but I can see an unidentified mass storage device in device manager.

But surely this is not the only copy of her dissertation. She probably lost like a couple hours if work, but not her whole dissertation. SURELY! Because who would work on a dissertation for a couple of years ond only save it on one usb stick?!

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this idiot did. She worked on it on her private laptop at home, but never saved a copy there. For years she was working on the same document, reading and writing on this usb stick.

She never saved in on another usb, never saved in on a pc directly, never mailed it to herself (*I spend 5 minutes explain to her that mailing it to herself would be a fast and easy way to save it. She did not understand this, to her this would not work and she was stupified I suggested this*), never used a private cloud storage, never used the faculty file share, never used the university's own cloud storage.

&amp;#x200B;

While I was getting all this information from her, I tried everything to access the USB stick, no dice.

&amp;#x200B;

Even $favSec cringed at some of the answers from $PhD. During this $PhD kept getting more and more distressed.

One last try, maybe she just didn't understand my questions for a backup.

\&gt;$Me: ""so you never saved a copy of this file anywhere else, ever?""

\&gt;$PhD: ""no, why should I?! I never needed to, this usb stick was working perfectly for the last 8 years.""

&amp;#x200B;

Well, yes, it did. Now it doesn't anymore. It was one of the first intenso rainbow usb sticks. Honestly, I was amazed it held for so long, it just reached its EOL with all her writing in this file for years.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$Me: ""Have you saved it in ANY other way?""

\&gt; *Now, in my language 'saved' can also be interpreted as 'protected'.*

\&gt;*$PhD stops crying and her eyes light up.* 

\&gt; *Hallelujah, we are saved.* 

&amp;#x200B;

It was all just a misunderstanding. Of course this 20-something student knows better and backed it up somewhere.

She hold up [this freaking leather pouch](https://www.google.com/search?q=usb+leather+pouch&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_deDE844DE844&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi48bjW9cXjAhVHxaYKHR2ZBAcQ_AUIEigC&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=578&amp;dpr=1.5#imgrc=AEFNsFvVmveN0M:)\#

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$PhD: ""Oh yes! I always protected it with this. Everytime I unplugged the usb, I put in in this. Does this help?“

\&gt;$Me: ""No, unfortunately this does not help…at all…“

&amp;#x200B;

This is when the wailing starts. I'm sitting there, wondering how this is my life. The other student worker proceeds to half drag $PhD out of the office into another one, while $favSec looks at me with wide eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;$Me: ""I want to make clear, that this is nothing my department could have prevented as she is responsible for her dissertation and we don't support this. We also don't support data recovery as you know. Everything important should be either on file share or on the university cloud.""

\&gt;$favSec: ""Understood, $Me, I make sure nothing falls back in you. Just please see if you can save anything.... I'll go and make a new pot of coffee. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Bless you, $favSec.

It was the truth when I told her we don't recover data. We have backup team for the fileshare and cloud, but desk side support has no tools for data recovery. And everyone knows this. It actually means 99% is saved correctly and the other 1% is on their own. But the crying.... So I consult my boss and my coworkers and try every freeware we can think off. After about 3 hours I actually have a couple of old file version recovered.

Bad news: they are around 5 months old.

&amp;#x200B;

So, after 3 hours and around 3 pots of coffee, $PhD has become slightly manic with a Coffein fueled glimmer in her eyes. I show her the files I recovered, send them to her mail and save them on her work pc and advise her to either buy the full version of the freeware or give it to a data recovery specialist. 

\&gt; $ME: ""Honestly, go with the data recovery. It will cost you, but the probably can save all of it.""

\&gt;$PhD: ""no no, I can do it. No problem. I will just rewrite 5 months of work until my submit date next week. No worries.""

She keeps mumbling while walking to her pc.

I'm slightly unsettled and just want to get out of her office ASAP.

$favSec gave me some muffins as a payment.

&amp;#x200B;

I get back to my office and find my coworkers on a smoke break. I still can't believe what just happened and tell them about the leather pouch. They were all equally mystified as I was, about how stupid users can be.

&amp;#x200B;

But as I said, it has become a good story to scare users into saving and a great icebreaker when meeting new IT people.

And as far as I know $PhD managed to get an extension on her submit date.

farrell_987,I Watched a User Commit Fraud,"So I've got a good one for you all! About 5 months ago I had just started at my current job, Technical support for Point of Sale systems. This also happens to be my first IT related position. This happened about 3 weeks into the job, so I'm fresh meat with a whole lot to learn yet. For the sake of the story let's call this restaurant Bob's Restaurant and the User Kevin.


Call from one of our partner dealer sites, Caller ID says 'Bob's Restaurant'

Answers phone: ""POS Support, How can I help you today?""

User:"" Hi, this is 'Kevin' from Bob's restaurant, I'm trying to delete an account in the back""

Me:""Ok give me one moment to get logged in and assist you.""

We use a remote connection program on all of our sites, the back computer acts as a server for all the POS Stations.
Gets logged in

Me:""Alright sir, could you show me which account you're trying to delete?""

User:""Yes it's this account here."" User hovers mouse over an account with more than 3000$ USD of balance. It's important to note that accounts act as tabs, customers can come in and put items on their accounts, and then come in at a later date and make payments on their accounts to reduce the balance owed. So for this account to have a 3000$ balance means that that account owes 3000.

Me:""Ok Kevin, give me a moment here.""

Me to my supervisor:"" Hey this guy wants to delete an account with 3k on it? No way we are allowed to do that correct?""

Supervisor:""Nah, not without a whole lot of security questions  and documentation to cover ourselves in case of an audit.""

Me to User""You said you name was Kevin? Could I please get your last name and position at the restaurant? ""

User:"" My name is Kevin *******, I am a General Manager.""

Me:""Ok Kevin, what is the reason for deleting this account?""

User:""What's with all these security questions? I shouldn't be getting interrogated. I have a request and it's your job to do it.""


At this point I knew some fishy stuff was going on.

Me:""I apologize Kevin, but I am going to have to discuss further actions with my supervisor as I cannot authorize the deletion of an account.""

It's company policy to not do any actions that could compromise a restaurants profits or cause legal repercussions. This is a huge red flag.

ME to Supervisor:"" So the guys says he's the GM, but this seems a little off to me, he got real defensive when I asked him some questions.""

Supervisor:""Ok let me take a look at what we've got.""

Looks over my notes, we discuss the possibility of fraud. As we are discussing it I hear over my headset: ""F**k this, I can do it myself."" Kevin immediately selects the account and hits delete, hits the confirmation. And boom just like that a owing balance of 3k gone. He immediately hung up afterwards. My supervisor told me to log everything, and be as detailed as possible including time stamps and include the call log. This was forwarded to my boss and later to the restaurant owner who confirmed with us that that account was held by Kevin's close friend. I am not aware of what happened to Kevin but I have my assumptions.

That was my first taste of how awful people are at times. He cost that restaurant 3k. Moral of the story: note down everything no matter how insignificant you think it is, it may very well protect you in the future.",talesfromtechsupport,2405,1563622927
Her0_0f_time,A user reported me today for being rude.,"Quick back story, Fairly important User calls and is having an issue printing from one specific program. She can print just fine otherwise. I tell her that I do not have access to fix the issue that she is having and give her the phone number for the software team that can. (Our line is more for hardware and general windows issues, any issues with in house programs we use have to go through another group)

She calls back 20 minutes later saying that no one is answering the phone when she calls claiming that I must have given her the wrong number. I confirm with her the phone number I gave her was the right one. (had her repeat back the number I gave her to make sure she has the right one and it was). They just werent asnwering the phones. She calls them again and same thing. She calls back and asks why I cant just fix her issue. And I explain again that I am unable to fix her issue as I do not have the access nor the training required on how to fix the program. She needs to go through the people that administrate the program to fix the issue.

Fast forwards to the 5th time she calls I am starting to get a bit annoyed at the situation. Its apparently my fault that they arent picking up their phones and that I need to fix her issue right now. 

Now I would like to think I have good patience when it comes to problem users. I try to put myself in their shoes and understand that they dont know all the technical details that we know. But when I encounter a user that just will not accept the fact that I am unable to solve their issue needless to say I get a little upset. At this point I am running out of nice ways to say I have no way to fix this issue, please contact the support number I gave you. If they arent picking up there really isnt anything that I can do. If they arent picking up for you, then they certainly wont be picking up for me. I dont know why they arent answering their phones its a completely separate department that we have very little to do with each other outside of making sure users can open up the software teams programs.",talesfromtechsupport,1293,1563554322
LongIslandTrooper,I don't think you know what cancel means.,"Since I have been dealing with users less and less over the years i don't have as many funny user stories like i used to.   
However some of my team members still deal with them on a day to day basis.  Here is a back and forth that one of my team members had with a user that was trying to look at a vendors presentation with the vendor onsite.  

&amp;#x200B;

Panicked lady:  ""WE HAVE A VENDOR UP HERE WHO NEEDS TO CONNECT TO THE PROJECTOR CAN YOU COME UP RIGHT NOW AND HELP US??????""  


SupportGuy:  ""Yeah sure ill be right up""  
""Wait.....""What kind of display options does the vendors laptop have? Like Display port, HDMI, VGA?""  


Panicked lady:  ""......Its a Dell....""

  
SupportGuy:  ""Right right, but what kind of display options does it have, like HDMI, VGA,..."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Vendor:""No worries man I have a dongle we just need a hook in place apparently""  


So i head up there to help out  
This particular room they are using is NOT made for vendor presentations. This room is meant for team building and internal training use only.  
so the only way to connect him in is to unplug the current PC and use that VGA all the way in the back corner for his laptop  
so as i am explaining this I think to myself, ""Man it would be a lot easier if he just sent the powerpoint to one of our ladies here in an email and they pulled it up on this PC but......whatever  
and right on queue the vendor goes 

&amp;#x200B;

Vendor:  ""This seems wrong....didnt I send all of you the powerpoint in email?  I feel like last time we did this it was super easy....why cant we just do that again?""   


Panicked lady:  "".....yeah we can do that....BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT IF YOU HAVE OUTLOOK 2010 OR LATER IT WONT WORK ON HERE SINCE THIS PC ONLY HAS 2007""  


SupportGuy:  ""No.....that's not correct...""  


Panicked lady:  ""YEAH THIS COMPUTER WONT EVEN LET ME LOG IN SINCE MY EMAILS BEEN UPGRADED!!!""  
SupportGuy:  ""Go ahead and launch outlook for me...""  
\*clicks outlook\*

\*pulls up sign in dialog box\*

\*she clicks cancel and then program terminates\*

Panicked lady:  ""SEE I TOLD YOU IT WOULDNT WORK""

SuppotGuy: ""Hold on hold on.....go back to outlook and click it again for me...""

\*Clicks outlook again\*

SupportGuy: ""Woah woah woah! Dont click cancel! Go ahead and enter your username and password for me""  
\*enters username and pw\* 

  
\*outlook opens with email of vendor at the top\*

Gambatte,Encyclopædia Moronica: W is for Wins from Zeroes,"It was a bright, sunny morning - birds were singing, the call queue was under control, the preventative maintenance up to date, and the office conversation was pleasant and lighthearted.  
In short, it was a perfect day at work.

TOO perfect. Clearly, something nefarious was afoot.

Caller ID flashed; the boss was calling. Time to lance this festering boil of pleasantness, and reveal the pustulent horrors within.

&gt; BOSS: Hey Gambatte!

&gt; ME: Hey Boss. What's up?

&gt; BOSS: Well, I've got good news, and I've got bad news...

Dammit. I knew it.

&gt; BOSS: The good news is that we're taking on a new customer, MAJOR_STORE!

&gt; ME: Nice! Do we have any information on what models of equipment they're using, service manuals, tech logins and whatnot?

&gt; BOSS: Well, uh, this came to us through SUPPLIER because they're using their equipment; apparently the original service provider for MAJOR_STORE just closed their doors and left all of their customers hanging with no notice.

&gt; ME: Uh oh. I have a sinking feeling...

&gt; BOSS: Yeah. The bad news is that we started as of Friday last week.

&gt; ME: Okay, we can...

&gt; BOSS: ...and you have three outstanding faults at your local store.

&gt; ME: Alright. Yeah, I can deal with that. Can you send through the fault information? I'll review it, and then contact the site managers about how we can best alleviate their issues until we can get a permanent fix in place.

&gt; BOSS: Well...

&gt; ME: No, let me guess. Because this is so new, we don't have a way to get the fault information into our system yet, so we know we have three outstanding faults - probably even case numbers - but no idea what they actually are?

&gt; BOSS: Yeah, pretty much. Have you played this game before?

&gt; ME: More often than I like. Alright, I head to site and figure out what's going on; the site manager might be able to pull the information from their system with those case numbers.

&gt; BOSS: Cool; let me know what you find out!

---

Less than half an hour later, I walked through the front doors of the store. I located a manager and introduced myself; we walked through the site induction and signing in process, then we started talking about the outstanding issues.

&gt; MANAGER: Well this printer prints funny. And so does this one.

&gt; ME: Okay, I had three case references for faults - do you know anything about this last one?

&gt; MANAGER: Uh... Oh, here it is! Yeah, we called in the same fault twice on two different days, and got two different case numbers.

Oh, this is going to be a fun site to look after.  
I tracked down model and serial numbers for all the equipment that had faults lodged against them, and departed. For now.

---

I found the manuals for the printers online. The poor printing quality was likely due to faulty print heads, so let's Oprah this - you get a new print head, and you get a new print head, everyone gets new print heads! Even the printers that they hadn't reported issues with, because they were in the minority. The one that was printing ""funny"" also got a replacement main logic board.  
In the space of three parts deliveries over about as many weeks, all of the outstanding faults were cleared.

&gt; ME: Hey Manager, I think we're done here - as best I determine, all of the reported faults are now resolved.

&gt; MANAGER: That's great! Does that include EQUIPMENT?

&gt; ME: ...What's wrong with EQUIPMENT?

&gt; MANAGER: I don't know. The screen's black?

&gt; ME: I don't have a call for it, but I guess I can take a quick look. If it's not a simple fix, you might need to log a call.

&gt; MANAGER: Great, thanks!

&gt; ME: ...I don't know where EQUIPMENT is.

&gt; MANAGER: Oh! Uh... There's seven identical installs scattered around the building, so just have a look around, I guess?

Great, I guess I'll just wander around until I find one that's malfunctioning? Well, we charge by the hour, so if they want us to wander about aimlessly, then the Customer Is Always Right.¹

---

¹ In this one, singular, very exact scenario; specifically, where it is at their expense, and I don't have anything else that I'd rather be doing.

---

After a few minutes, I identified not one, but two sets of EQUIPMENT that were non-functional.

The first was a very difficult problem, that took all of my many years of experience to correct.  
I plugged it back in.

The second was considerably more complex. On powering it up, the BIOS splash screen would flash up... then the screen would go black.

&gt; ME: Uh... Manager? I've got no information on this equipment; is that what it's meant to do?

&gt; MANAGER: ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

&gt; ME: ... Thanks.

After a few minutes of the screen continuing to be black, I gathered that the equipment was not in some sort of start up processing state.

&gt; ME: Okay, I think this has got something a bit more serious wrong with it - you'll have to raise a fault call so I can book some time and parts against it.

&gt; MANAGER: No problem, I'll book it right now!

&gt; ME: Great - I'll be back once I've got the job and the paperwork is in order.

&gt; MANAGER: Ha! I'm doing it right now; you won't even get out of the car park!

---

I made it out of the car park.

---

Two weeks later, a new job dinged into my queue. At long, long last, the job for EQUIPMENT had arrived.  
In the interim, we'd finally received the official process for investigating and troubleshooting EQUIPMENT - there was a special USB cable, a SD card, and a whole official and trademarked process detailing how to reload the files. Now that I had a job, I quickly drove back down to the store, extracted the EQUIPMENT, and brought it back to the workshop, so as to better follow the official processes.

Official process #1: Power up EQUIPMENT, connect the USB cable, and access internal storage to reload application files from external sources. RESULT: No dice. EQUIPMENT is completely unresponsive.  
Official process #2: Boot from SD card, copy application files from SD card to internal storage. RESULT: Nada. Boot menu doesn't even present on the screen.  
Official process #3: ...  
Unofficial process #1: Improvise? Uh, I mean, ""fall back on the skills and wisdom developed over years of experience"", aka poke at it and see what happens.

I consulted the manuals again - and again - and again. On what felt like the nine hundredth consultation of the system manuals, I happened to notice a diagram that demonstrated the position of a RESET switch under an almost unnoticeable pin hole. Given a severe lack of other options presenting themselves, I grabbed a paperclip and tentatively probed the recess.

And... nothing. No haptic or audible feedback; I might as well have been pressing a paperclip into the workbench. Intrigued, I reached for a screwdriver...

In moments, the case was open. Inspecting the switch revealed that pressing it produced the normally expected click. However, under the pin hole was a soft plastic cover - which had a small hole through it. The broken edges of the hole looked as if they might line up with the switch... Some short work with a sharp knife and some plastic cement² soon had it repaired well enough to no longer trigger the switch.  
A further few moments reassembling the case, and I was able to power up the EQUIPMENT - and this time, the BIOS splash screen lasted much longer than 10 seconds. After a few more moments, the store application loaded, and the EQUIPMENT appeared to be fully functional once again.

I grabbed the paperclip once again and applied it to the RESET switch. After holding it down for 10 seconds, the screen abruptly switched off.  
I watched, and waited, and watched some more.

After a moment of watching the system not boot up again, I was struck by a thought. I applied the paperclip once again - and the system immediately began booting.

The RESET switch was actually a POWER switch, and after being turned off, it needed to be turned back on again.  
The damaged cover had been holding down the POWER switch, so when it was powered up, it would get 10 seconds into the boot sequence - just enough to display the BIOS splash screen - then turn off.

---

² That these tools of my hobbies were readily available in the workshop should imply nothing about my utilization of work hours, because as demonstrated, there were *legitimate business reasons* for these tools to be present. /shiftyeyes

---

**TL/DR: Zero information about a new customer, zero preparation time, zero useful official processes received from on high. Still resolved all reported faults (and few that weren't) in the first few weeks.**

**Addendum:**

&gt; BOSS: Hey Gambatte, how has MAJOR_STORE been?

&gt; ME: Eh... Apart from their penchant for reporting a single fault multiple times, they haven't been too bad. Some of the managers can be a bit grumpy sometimes, but that's no different from any other customer. Why do you ask?

&gt; BOSS: Oh, okay. I was talking with some of the guys from SUPPLIER; apparently when they talk about MAJOR_STORE, the branch that always comes up as the example of the worst customer behaviour is the one closest to you.

&gt; ME: Well... Good to know, I guess? They've been perfectly reasonable, so far. I guess... I'll keep an eye on them, and let you know if they take a turn for the worse.

NotYourNanny,"The boss isn't always right, but he is always the boss.","But not all bosses are weak, cowardly weasels. Some will eat crow when it's on the menu.

Hapless Hank works for a retail chain with a couple of dozen stores in three states. He's been there since the era of dumb terminals and analog data lines, and he built today's VPN based WAN for the Windows point of sale system from the ground up. He's been with the company for a long, long time, and it has worked out well for the company and for Hank.

One of the reasons it has worked out well is that he has trained his boss well. The boss, who we shall call Bob, because that's not his name, is the #2 guy in the company, and is rather more tech savvy than most execs. But he knows his limits. He also knows that if he asks Hapless Hank technical questions, trying to sound smart for the owner, he'll get technical answers until his eyes glaze over and he asks for an executive summary.

The bottom line is, if Hank is out of the office for the rare vacation, Bob the Boss can handle most of the routine stuff that comes up. And when something needs to be done, Bob the Boss and the owner tell Hank what they want, Hank tells them what it will cost, and they say yeah or nay, and everybody gets on with their job.

Hank has been with the company for a long time because he likes working there, and they keep him around because he does the job well.

A virtual paradise of IT work.

But even the Garden of Eden has its snake. And occasionally, that snake will bite someone. In this case, it actually bit someone who had it coming.

The main point-of-sale server had been spontaneously shutting down for no apparent reason, and going through some acrobatics on reboot. It didn't take long for everyone, including the support desk at the vendor, to agree that it sounded like the UPS was going bad. (The electrical service in the neighborhood was . . . less than perfectly reliable, and occasional blips were not uncommon.) But nobody was certain enough to foot the bill to replace it without a test. So a test was in order.

The server was, of course, running on a state of the art *nix operating system. The sort that really doesn't like not being shut down properly (hence the acrobatics on reboot). Bad things can happen, like corrupted file systems. Hapless Hank knew this, and explained it carefully to Bob the Boss using small words. But this was early in their relationship, and Bob hadn't yet learned that when Hank was certain about something, he was almost always right. And Bob was feeling a little cocky.

&gt;Bob: Let's just unplug the UPS from the wall and see what happens.

&gt;Hank: That's a bad idea. It could corrupt the file system. The server wouldn't boot, and somebody would have to spend the next four and a half hours doing a restore from the backup tape. Then the stores would have to go through the logs and manually reenter all the business that happened before it died. And we'd have to enter all the credit card stuff as cash, so the books would be a mess. You know our controller won't like that at all.

(Yeah, it really took that long. There was a lot of data, and the drive was chosen more for reliability than speed. And it was a long time ago.)

&gt;Bob: Oh, it'll be fine.

&gt;Hank: I really advise against it. We need to shut the server down first (which involves notifying all the stores to go offline, because neither of our adventurers wanted to come in after hours).

&gt;Bob: That'll take a half an hour by the time we call everyone, shut it down, and boot it back up. And the stores hate going offline. And it's dinner time. It'll be fine.

&gt;Hank: If it doesn't boot back up, I'm not staying to do the restore. 

&gt;Bob: Fine. If it doesn't boot back up, I'll stay and do the restore.

You already know the rest of the story. I went out to dinner at a nice steak house. Bob, IIRC, had stale donuts, watching the percentage restored sloooowly count up for four and a half hours, while all the stores were offline. Accounting was unhappy the next morning because nobody could balance the books and do the bank deposit until they'd manually rekeyed everything and uploaded all the offline transactions. Bob the Boss didn't have an especially happy day, because crow is not tasty, even with salt.

These days, Bob the Boss does not *always* listen to Hapless Hank. But when it's a warning of possible technical problems, it's the way to bet.",talesfromtechsupport,1409,1563231498

OK, let's not waste any time troubleshooting - we'll try the other one. It won't read the disk.

There are no USB floppy drives anywhere on campus (or if there are, they have excellent hiding spots).

As it happens, last Friday I had a retrocomputing meet to which I had taken my Win95 gaming rig (for a bit of multiplayer LAN goodness).

jazzb54,"New VP ""improves"" the process and almost gets me fired.","Another story reminded me about this one.

I was at a place where things were falling apart.  Stale cases built up in our buckets because we kept on reducing the support staff to save budget.  If a customer stopped responding, we didn't chase them down.  We rarely had time to scrape through our queue to follow-up on old cases.

We got a new VP of Customer Success.  She contracted out a support team in India and got rid of our team in Southern California.  She replaced 3 very experienced people with a team of 12.  Sounds good, but this team of 12 was new, and they were put on the phones immediately.

She then handed down a new rule that we (US team) could absolutely do no overtime except for a max of 2 hours a week for on-call escalation consult (we didn't work directly with the customer for these, only the India team).  When our shift was over, we were to warm transfer any active cases to the overseas (oursourced) team.  No Exceptions.  My direct manager tried to push back against this new rule but he was told to pound sand.

I was on a call with a customer who also happened to be an investor and they had a seat on our board.  I usually hand-held them through things, and I did a lot of after-hours stuff with them.  They pretty much just worked with me most of the time.  It got close to 5PM and I told them that ""due to new policies, I will have to hand this call off to the next shift.""  I got a little pushback, however the other guy understood office politics well enough to know that I had to hand him off.  He asked to speak to my manager.  My manager agreed to take the call and I handed it off to him.  I then clocked out and went home.

Well, the overseas team couldn't help the customer.  He asked that the case be escalated and they did so.  It ended up back in my queue, but I was not allowed to even check in with the case.  The guy emailed me directly and I explained that we have new rules and I can't go around them.  I also told him that since was not scheduled to be on-call this weekend, I'm not allowed to work on the case.  The guy that was already on-call had maxed out his 2 on-call hours for the weekend on Friday night.  The case sat until Monday.

On Monday, I jumped back on and got them fixed in about 30 minutes.  The guy warned me that his boss raised a big stink with us, but they explained the situation and that it wasn't my fault since I was following orders - I should be all-good.  Come Monday afternoon (because everybody else comes in later then tech support), I got hauled upstairs with my direct manager, HR and the CEO.  A folder with my name was sitting on the desk of HR.  I'm pretty sure it was my termination letter (because fuck me, right?).

They asked me to explain what happened, and why did I suddenly ""refuse"" to help our customer/investor and board member.  I explained what happened, and that I followed the rules to the letter.  My boss jumped in and said ""He followed the rules as set by VP.  I got on the phone and repeated the rules to the customer.  I also told them that our VP set these rules and that there were to be no exceptions, and they accepted the transfer to the new guys.""

My boss then said ""here is an email I got from the customer, as well as a copy of the phone conversation.  I don't know what kind of bullshit you guys heard, but you can see in the email here, they love our guy, and they want us to fix our policy.""  He pulled out another email and said ""here's the policy from VP - as you can see, she is very explicit that there are no exceptions.""

At this point I was excused from the room and sent back to continue my day.  Later on, my boss comes downstairs and calls me into his office.  He shuts the door and said ""listen to this.""  He played back some of the meeting that he recorded on his phone.

I couldn't hear everything, but basically, they got the VP on the speaker phone and tore her apart.  She tried to back-peddle and said ""I already talked to TS-BOSS (my boss) and he of course knows there are always exceptions, JAZZB54 doesn't know what he is doing - I'll take care of it."" My boss spoke up and yelled out ""bullshit!  Read the fucking email she sent me."" (my boss could be an belligerent ass, but he was always fair).

HR read the email exchange the VP had with my boss out-loud, including the part where she emphasized that there were to be no exceptions.  Recording ended at that point.

Later that week, it was announced that my boss was the interm-VP of Worldwide Customer Success.  The previous VP was moved to VP of Operations.  It was the 3rd time she was re-assigned.

Things went back to the way they were.  Backlog still sucked, but we were at least able to help customers that worked with us.  We got back our overtime and started booking 20+ hours of overtime a week.

A short time later, I left for a job that paid much more, and I only had to work 40-45 hours a week.  I still keep in contact with my former boss.  The stories he tells me... I'm surprised they are even still in business.

About three years ago, guy called in absolutely livid about packet loss across his internet circuit. 

Me: ""No problem, sir. Lemme check out the circuit. What's your circuit ID?"" After he gives me the circuit ID, he says, ""Yeah, my VoIP provider says that your route is causing me to drop packets. So you're costing me money on my calls! I've been dealing with this from you for weeks!""

I pull the circuit and, of course, I'm not seeing any issue. I ran a ping test and traceroute from the core to Google's DNS and a public IP from a well-known source as well as from three public looking glasses.

Me: ""Sir, I'm looking at this circuit and there is no issue. The optics are clean, the route is having no issues and all three looking glasses agree with our results.""

Cust: ""I'm sick of this. I'm bringing on my VoIP provider and y'all are going to fix this issue now!""

He puts me on hold and brings on a rep for his VoIP.

Rep: ""Well, sir, we are seeing drops to you VoIP device on site so this is an ISP issue.""

Me: ""Sir, the circuit hasn't dropped once and I assume your VoIP provider is checking remotely. Do you have a connection that isn't using either one of us?""

Cust: ""Yeah.""

Me: ""Ok. Can you run a continuous ping to your gateway's IP and your VoIP provider's IP at the same time? If you want, you can run a ping to Google's DNS and your VoIP provider's IP in the circuit, too.""

The guy starts his test and the rep says something snide but not loud enough to be clearly heard.

Cust: ""Ok both are running. Hold on...what the hell is this?! Hey, (VoIP rep)? Why the hell am I showing packet loss to your IP but not to my gateway?!""

Rep: ""That's because you're using a coax modem to ping and coax connections aren't guaranteed to-""

Cust: ""But I'm not losing a single packet to my ISP gateway and I'm not even on their network!""

Rep: ""Again, that's because you're on a coax connection and-""

Cust: ""Really?! Fine, let's run this on the fiber.""

He sets it up and says...

Cust: ""Oh yeah there's a big difference now. The pings to Google's DNS are much better and you're still dropping packets!""

Rep: ""Well, sir, it could be an issue with the routing-""

Cust: ""That shit doesn't make any sense!! I'm even using a looking glass and packets are dropping to your IP!! You all told me that my performance is great to the internet! I haven't dropped a single damn packet to the internet but your shitty service is constantly dropping! You all told me that it was my provider for weeks and it's been your shit!! I've wasted money on this! How do you explain this?!""

The rep comes up with some answer but I can't hear it because I'm on mute laughing so hard that my leads pull the call to hear it. The rep gets off the phone and the guy says, ""I'm sorry for calling y'all. But can you believe this shit?! They're blaming y'all and costing me money and she tries to blow smoke up my ass while I'm running the test proving her stuff sucks!!""

nicsaweiner,when tech support meets tech support,"i work for a company which gives ipads to to remote users for logging information. we use a third party program to log this information. one of my responsibilities is to mediate the issues between our company's tech support issues and the ones caused by the third party program. in this story i will refer to myself as $Me, the third party support rep as $Rep, and his manager as $Manager.

this morning, i get a complaint from an employee that they are unable to save notes in a certain section. they seem to be doing everything right, so i open a ticket with the third party help desk and tell them about the issue, accompanied with a screenshot of exactly what i'm referring to. 

i get a pretty quick response. they call me directly instead of replying to the support ticket. we go through all the basic troubleshooting that i always make sure to do before hand. ipad is up to date, the software is up to date, and the ipad has been restarted. because of a language barrier i spent several minutes trying to explain to him that my client was not trying to delete a certain section of the notes, but rather they were unable to fill out notes in a certain section. i finally get $Rep to understand my issues and then the following conversation occurs. 

$Rep: everything is working fine from my end. i can save notes without any issues.

$Me: thats great, but my employee cannot do this. 

$Rep: (proceeds to explain step by step instructions on how to add notes)

$Me: the employee is aware of how to save notes, the issue is that after they try to save them, the notes disappear and do not populate in the final report. 

$Rep: im adding notes right now and it's working fine. 

$Me: again, thats great that you can, but why is my employee unable to do so?

$Rep: im not sure, my computer works just fine. could you have her go over this step by step on her computer while we are on the line?

$Me: your computer? our employees only use ipads (the company should be well aware of this. we are their biggest client and we submit support tickets quite often) besides, our employees work remotely and i communicate with them via email.

$Rep: let me forward this up to my manager

*on hold for several minutes*

$Manager: i hear your having issues with notes

$Me: yes, the notes will not populate in a certain section of the report. the employee can add notes to the report, but they disappear when the report is compiled.

$Manager: strange, i can populate notes in that section just fine.

$Me: thats great, $rep said he was able to do so as well, but this does not help my employee. why do you think they are having this issue?

$Manager: im not sure, could we have the employee sit at a computer and do this step by step over the phone?

$Me: No, our employees work remotely and they only use ipads. we cannot sit down with them, and we cannot use a computer. i already told $rep this. 

$Manager: i see, let me check with out ipad development team. (*puts me on hold for about a minute*) This is a known issue and we are working to resolve it.

TheLightningCount1,"How a favor for a friend ended up costing a small company millions in sales, and my service fees.","Over the July 4th holiday we had some pretty severe storms in my area. I have been on a very long, and much needed, staycation from work... which has absolutely nothing to do with the release of Shadow Bringers. Nothing to do with that at all. 

I was enjoying a nice cup of diet cola watching some epic cutscenes from the expansion when my phone rang. ""Ignore it Thelightningcount1. IF you ignore it, they will go away."" I go back to gaming when the phone rings 9 more times. 

I finally pick up. 

&gt; $Me - What?  
&gt; $Friend - Can you come help me out, I can make sure you get paid. My new computer in the new office is not working.  

&gt; $Me = Duncan Vizla
&gt; $Friend = Ezra Bridger (season 1)  
&gt; $FB = Friend's Boss or Boris Shcherbina

&gt; $Me - 200  
&gt; $Friend - Huh?  
&gt; $Me - Im on vacation and that is my fee.  
&gt; $FB - This is his manager. IF you are worth it, I will pay it. 

I drive out to his office and take a look at his PC. It will post, but will not move past that. 

&gt; $ME - May be the hard drive, going to open er up and take a look. 

I open up the case and immediately see the issue. Every cap is blown on the mobo. Every. Single. One. How this thing posted? No fuggin clue. 

&gt; $Me - Uhh... did you guys have any kind of power surge in the building recently?  
&gt; $FB - The building did receive a lightning strike. (No the irony is not lost on me.)  
&gt; $Friend - Nothing had power for most of the week.  
&gt; $ME - Did you not have a surge protector?  
&gt; $FB - See those strips along the floor, those are industrial power strips. I am told that they protect against power surges. 

The things he was pointing out were those long metal office power strips. The ones that have no, or very little, surge protection capability. 

&gt; $Me - Heh those are not surge protectors, merely... power... strips... 

I look at every single computer in the room slowly. 

&gt; $ME - *The exit is just to my left. I can just walk out right now. I can just walk out and never look back... $FB is sort of in my way, but he is scrawnier than me... I can just bowl him over. No one will ever know.* Try turning on all the PCs in this office please. *WHY!!!! WHY DID YOU SAY THAT?*

Of the nearly 200 computers in the office, 1 booted into windows. It was not plugged in at the time of the lightning strike. 

&gt; $FB - What do you suggest?  
&gt; $ME - You got warranty on these machines?  
&gt; $Friend - Wait what?  
&gt; $FB - The simple warranty. I will have to call dell to see if it covers power surges.  

After a short phone call $FB walks out of his office with no color in his face. 

&gt; $FB - The warranty we have does not cover power surges they said they can send out a tech and charge us for every computer that is damage.  
&gt; $ME - Do you have insurance?  
&gt; $FB - Yes.

I collected my 200 and walked out the door thinking it was over. 

Four days later. 

Phone rings and I am currently watching the MOST EPIC cutscene SE have ever done with one of their expansions as I go to fight Emet Selch. 

I ignore it and focus on the game as the most epic of fights followed the most epic of cutscenes. 

The phone rings as I finish up the story line. 

&gt; $FB - How much would you charge to rebuild all of the computers in this office?  
&gt; $Me - How many? *I should just hang up right now.*  
&gt; $FB - All but 1 of them.  
&gt; $Me - 50 bucks per machine. *There is no way he will say yes to that. Looks like you get to focus on titania extreme this weekend.*  
&gt; $FB - 25 per computer?  

I stop... Am I miscalculating how much money 50 per computer was? Answer was yes... yes I was. I dropped an entire zero on that number. That is a lot of money... but I also REALLY want to play this brand new expansion. 

&gt; $Me - 30  
&gt; $FB - Deal. 
&gt; $Me - *Dammit... I think.* OK I will be right over and get to work. 

I drive out there and see a TON of Dell boxes all over the place. 

&gt; $FB - The warranty guy wanted to charge 85 per computer, after the parts. So I just bought the parts and called you. 

I curse myself thinking I shouldn't have low balled it so hard. 

&gt; $ME - Ok. If I am going to do this, you are going to have to help me get everything organized. Each desk will have the parts needed for each PC next to it and I will get to work from there. 

Every PC needed a mobo and PSU replacement as well as half needing ran or processor replacements. Only 1 HDD was damaged and it was a storage drive, not the NVME SSD. 

I go down the line and remove the side panel from each machine, then remove the power cables from each machine, then unscrew the dead mobos from each machine, and you can see how this went. 

By the end of an 8 hour day I had most of the work done. Just needed to boot each machine up and pray. 

Wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Only 2 DOA PSUs that came out. Was able to head to Micro Center and grab 2 cheapo PSUs using my own money. The guy said he would reimburse me for it separately. 

By nearly midnight I had all computers up and running and waiting for the logins. There was one thing I forced each new desk to have though. A high quality surge protector. 

I am handed the largest check I have ever seen in my life and walk out the door with a smile.

hansolox1,Know when to ignore the policy.,"First of all I'm not in support, but rather in software development so I usually don't deal with issues like that. Another thing is that our it has a list of email clients they support, but you are allowed to use anything you want, but then you are on your own if it breaks. Everything on the supported list sucks though.

Now this happened a few years ago. While I was slowly packing up my things to go home an executive I've never spoken to for more than a few minutes comes up to me and says that he has a problem with email syncing and the support won't help. I ask about it and feel bad for the guy, literally all he does all day is answer emails and IT is trying to force him to use a shit email client. He also lists what he's tried to do to fix the problem himself and it all seems extremely reasonable. He clearly is not computer illiterate. So I do some googling, stay in 30 minutes after my time ends and fix it.

Next day I had a 6 pack on my desk when I came in with a thank you note on it. A few weeks later I got an email from HR saying that due to executive decision I've received a raise for going above and beyond and to sign the updated contract.

This is why I think you should ignore policy when an important enough person asks to.",talesfromtechsupport,1277,1562856868
BuzzTheToy,Felt like an outcast for the first time ever in IT,"I started working for this company about 18 months ago and I always found it odd that instantly people started emailing me directly saying they would submit a ticket but they want my help and don't want anyone else in my department to help. Come to find out my department had absolutely horrible social skills and were just flat out rude and condescending to people when they were helping them (There have been times I have heard one of our sysadmins on occasion call people a fucking idiot in a conference call just to name one instance. Somehow they have never gotten in trouble for this.) . I brushed it off and went on my way. So back when I was really green with the company and still learning where everything was located and whatnot anytime I would ask for help I would get a smug response ""Figure it out on your own, or I had to do it myself so you can do it yourself"" I honestly couldn't believe myself, come to find out not one person in my IT department ever wanted to end up in IT ironically, they all hate what they do. I get made fun of constantly for having a mechanical keyboard and some gaming and horror movie related funko pop figurines on my desk because ""It's childish"" I have been on the hunt for a new job for a few months for something that I could call a long term home and potentially move up in positions, so I have really been struggling with tolerating my employees and all I can say is it's the little things people say that are just enough to make me continue a little longer here while looking for another job.

Magentium,"""But why can't I have my manager's Password? This is important!""","Long time lurker, first time poster. Thought this one is worthy of being here.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: This happened around 4 years ago. I work for a large Bank at the IT Service Desk. We handle menial tasks like Password Resets, all the way through to provisioning of hardware, ""first line of defense"" for fraud and AML , among some other things. In a nutshell, every single call we get is carefully analysed and documented, on the chance something goes wrong and we need a trail of actions taken before hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of a long one. TL,DR is at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a Monday, we were flat out busy taking calls (over 600 a day between 10 of us) and I got the call from a rather annoying Personal Assistant, we'll call her $PA. $Manager is the manager she is said PA for (A very high up individual). I'm $Me.

&amp;#x200B;

**$Me** : Good morning IT this is $Me, can I confirm I am speaking to $PA?

**$PA**: I need help to reset the password for $Manager.

**$Me** : Okay, I need an email from $Manager confirming they are happy for this to occur.

**$PA** : Okay, hang on . . . (puts me on hold) . . . Okay it's sent.

( I notice that the email states : *From $PA on behalf of $Manager,* indicating $PA sent it from $Manager's mailbox in her email client, since she has access to that)

**$Me** : So I can see here you've sent this from your account, on behalf of $Manager. Unfortunately it has to come directly from him so we know that he has authorised it. Can he send us an email from his phone?

**$PA** : No, he can't. He's not here.

**$Me** : Then I can't reset his password, since he won't be aware of the change . . . (She cuts me off)

**$PA** : ""But why can't I have my manager's password? This is important!""

**$Me** : Unfortunately, I can't reset this password for you, without his knowledge. Also, another colleague using his account is a breach of our ""Use of Business Technology"" agreement . . . (Cut off again)

**$PA** : (Yells) I don't care, I need to get in and do this NOW! 

**$Me** : I'm sorry, I can't do this as $Manager is not present, nor are you allowed to use their account . . . (She hangs up on me whilst I'm talking)

  
I document the issue and let my Manager know. About 15 minutes pass by, and I've taken another 4 calls in that time. Our Head of Department (**$HOD**) comes storming up, more angry than I have ever seen her.

&amp;#x200B;

**$HOD** : $Me, explain to me, immediately, why you refused to reset $Manager's password!

**$Me** : (A little startled as $HOD is usually super nice) Hi $HOD, how did you know about that call?

&amp;#x200B;

**$HOD** : She called me and complained about it , saying you weren't doing your job and that you have now cost the company Millions of dollars in losses!

&amp;#x200B;

**$Me:** Okay . . . Well  I refused to reset the password as it was a breach of our Business Technology Usage agreement, which I believe you are aware of, and it didn't seem right to me to provide the details to $PA (don't quote me there, I don't remember the exact words). I also believe that $PA attempted to access $Manager's account without permission, which has caused issues in the past, which I don't really want to have to deal with again""

&amp;#x200B;

**$HOD** looks at me for a few seconds,smiles, and says: ""Completely understandable. Thank you for not providing that password. You've done a good job."" and promptly leaves. I shrug, and go about my day (these things happen, and I really didn't have the time to care about someone being upset at me).

&amp;#x200B;

Very shortly after, a Company wide email was sent reporting that ""due to individuals repeatedly abusing the ability to request a password reset for their Manager, the IT Service Desk will no longer be authorised to provide passwords to anybody except the individual in question, and only after correct Identification of the individual has been completed. No exceptions"". The email was from $HOD.

&amp;#x200B;

To this day $PA refuses to speak to me, which sucks for her since I seem to always answer when she calls. I just politely remind her when she calls that she is well aware that I can't do this. We now have had this happen more often (with the company getting bigger) and so all staff go through Mandatory Cyber Security training that enforces this. Anyone who attempts to bypass the procedure, complains about the procedure, or is thought to be attempting a breach of the ""Business Technology Usage"" agreement, is marked down in our Risk Register, and is subsequently investigated.  


**TL;DR :** PA gets irate that we won't provide her the password for her Manager's account. Attempts to get Head of Department involved. Backfires on her and gets Company wide policy updated. Staff can now lose their jobs if they attempt to bypass the policy.",talesfromtechsupport,1835,1562422600
CreatorKami,"""Re-enable my account right now! I did nothing wrong!""","I am the manager of my college's IT helpdesk, but I started out as a student worker. I have plenty of stories from working here, enough that I joke with *my* manager a lot that one day I'm gonna write a book of them. But my favorite experience is by far before I was hired on as the full-time manager, still job shadowing the person who had my position previously.  
 

**Background:** My IT department has very strict cybersecurity regulations, seeing as cyber criminals enjoy targeting smaller, likely less protected schools, which contain a lot of sensitive information about students and staff. One of our rules for employees of the school is that anyone employed at the college (even student workers now, though not at the time of this story) **must** complete mandatory annual IT security training. This consists of the standard phishing recognition quizzes, social engineering cue reading, etc. We give employees the *entire semester* to complete this training and send bi-weekly notifications to their employee email addresses to let them know of the training deadline. The consequence of not completing the training? The user's account is marked as disabled until they reach out to us, provide us with an alternate email address to which we can send their customized training link, complete the training, and then notify us.

 

Now, after the deadline, our security admin (SA) sent out a spreadsheet to our team containing the names and email addresses of all the employees who failed to complete that training. The list was... remarkably long lol. Most people who called in were understanding, apologetic, and polite. But *one* employee was... yikes. We'll call her angry professor (AP).

 

**Me:** Thank you for calling your IT service desk, how can I help you?

**AP:** I need to get into my email. It's urgent.

**Me:** Alright, not a problem. Will you please let me know the error you are receiving when trying to access your account?

**AP:** It says you've disabled my account. I need to know why that is, and I need you to re-enable it right now.

**Me:** Pardon me just one moment, and I will investigate what might be causing this issue.

*(When I checked the list of employees who hadn't completed the IT training... yep, AP was on the list.)*

**Me:** Ah, I see what the issue is. Our records indicate that you had not completed the IT security training by the deadline, and the system automatically disabled your account--

**AP:** Excuse me, but uh. I'll have you know that I *did* complete that useless training you guys make me do every year. I have proof on my iPad. So, you had better re-enable my account immediately.

**Me:** I understand your frustration. If you will, please provide us with an alternative email address that I may provide our SA so that he may correspond with you to get this situation resolved right away.

**AP:** No, I won't do it! I don't see any need for that because I did nothing wrong and I have proof! I want you to fix my account right now!

**Me:** My apologies, but unfortunately, I am not authorized to re-enable accounts which have been disabled due to our security policies. However, I will be happy to email our SA on your behalf to get this resolved.

**AP:** You better get this fixed right now. I'll be expecting a call back ASAP.

**Me:** Understood, is there anything else I can help you w---

**AP:** *(hangs up)*

 

So, I emailed SA to let him know that AP was on the list of individuals who hadn't completed the training and refused to provide us with an alternate email. He eventually emailed back and let us know that, while she *had* completed the training, AP had completed it *two weeks late*. He told us that he had re-enabled her account and should be available to her ""whenever the system processes the change"". This gave me a very inaccurate time frame, and a very bad position. If I called AP back and told her that her account should be available in the next few minutes, she could check too soon and call back in a rage. But... if I told her a few hours, she would probably throw a fit that it couldn't be done immediately. So, I thought up a plan seeing as it was about 2 or 3 hours until the end of the day and gave her a call back.  
 

**Me:** Good afternoon, AP, you called us earlier regarding your disabled account? I am calling to inform you that your account has now been re-enabled, and you should have access to your email again *before the end of the day.*  
 

She was silent on the other end of the line for a solid 5-7 seconds. I thought the line had disconnected, but before I could confirm, she spoke up. Keep in mind, at this point, I'm still a *student worker.* And this is a professor speaking to me like this. 

 

**AP:** End of the day??? Make it go faster!! Don't you know I can't do my job without my email, you idiot!

**Me:** I believe there may be some miscommunication, ma'am. The system is currently processing the request to re-enable your account. This may take some time. I understand your frustration, but---

**AP:** Well you better just call the vendor of that system and tell them to make it go faster! I need my account NOW!

**Me:** I understand; however, I do not have the ability nor the authority to follow through on that request. Thank you for being patient and understanding.

**AP:** Well. I'll have you know. Once your system lets me back into my account, I'll be writing a very strongly worded letter to Mr. IT Department Director about what a terrible employee you are that you can't do your job.

**Me:** Thank you for your feedback. Is there anything else I can help you---?

**AP:** *(hangs up again)*  
 

Yikes. I was sweating, but the jaded guy who had the helpdesk managerial position was laughing since it was his last week: ""same sh\*t, different day"". Now, I was thinking that was the end of that; she'd get her account back, send an email to the director, and the director would laugh at her and tell her exactly what I told her but less kindly. But no. She calls back later, a smug tone in her voice.  
 

**Me:** Thank you for calling your IT service desk, how can I help you?

**AP:** Guess who has access to her account now. \~

**Me:** I'm very happy to hear that. Please let us know if we can--

**AP:** I just wanted to let you know before you misinform anyone else that they won't have access to their account until *after the end of the day.*

**Me:** Understood, thank you for your feedback on our customer service. We're always looking to improve the experience our users have. Is there anything else I can help you with? :)

**AP:** *(hangs up)*

 

I couldn't help but laugh when she hung up that she twisted my words from earlier. Later that week, I asked my department director if she ever emailed him, and he told me no. However, he also explained that based on her actions, *he let her immediate supervisor know of her behavior.* And if anyone, especially an employee of our college, ever acts such a way to me or anyone working with me again, to let him know immediately so that he may act.

 

Ever since then, every time AP calls the helpdesk, she is as sweet as honey. :)",talesfromtechsupport,1847,1562383698

theservman,User Reads Manual Before Calling Support,"I swear this actually happened!

We're in the middle of a new laptop rollout at work, and one user got her new laptop this morning. A few minutes ago she called asking for help setting up her SoftPhone (Shoretel).

Her actual question was ""what's the server name we're supposed to use?"". Ok, not atypical so far... I tell her the name, but she says it's still not working for her. In that event the problem is usually the password... The phone system is not integrated into our directory, has higher complexity requirement than we're using in the rest of the organization, and the software allows users to save their password. The end result of is that no one knows their password.

So I go ahead and reset her password, and remote in to help her through the configuration. When I get in, I see that the server name was put in as name. domain. tld (note the spaces). I take out the spaces, enter her temporary password, and get her logged in (complete with password reset on first login).

Here's where it gets crazy... Once I finish I notice that Acrobat is open in the background. The document: How to Configure Shoretel Client.

The user actually went out looking for documentation from our document management systems (which most of our users are allergic to - one actually complained to the Joint Health and Safety Committee that having to use it represented a psycho-socio workplace hazard.), found it, opened it, and read it before calling for support.

The reason for all of those attempts is due to the fact that I wasn't able to join the military due to my hearing impairment. Turns out that Uncle Sam doesn't like it when you try to join already deaf; he wants that joy all to himself. 

Well, this past January I'd put in an application for a position at my local Air Force base. As far as government job postings go, this was a rather mundane description. The gist of it was pretty much just maintain the file permissions of the various users and groups. Eh, simple enough. I just figured they'd be using Active Directory, something I've got a fair amount of experience with.

Flash forward to February, and I get an email alerting me that I've been referred for the position. For those that are not aware, government actions on anything, even on hiring personnel to fill a role, takes forever. So, February I was referred to the role, and March is when I get scheduled for the interview.

The way an interview process for a government position works is way different than you expect in the private sector. You show up, they give you a sheet of paper that lists the questions they want to ask you, and give you 5-15 minutes to write down your answers. Then, they'll collect you and guide you to a conference room where you'll be interviewed by 3 or so people, asking you the questions that you've already answered on your sheet of paper. It's this process where things almost went completely south, sideways, pear-shaped, or any other colorful euphemism (personally, I prefer Charlie-Foxtrot). 

They take me to a room to fill out my questionnaire. All told, there were five questions they wanted me to answer. The first four dealt with applications that I had never heard of; I didn't even have a clue as to their proper function because the questions related to those applications were so vague! The fifth question asked me about what certifications I had, for those who were curious.

I sat there for about five or so minutes, going over each and every question. I had no idea how to answer them. Finally, I decided to write across the top of the paper, ""After reviewing the questions provided, I feel I may not be a good fit for this position. Thank you for your time and consideration."" I poked my head out of the room I was in, and I didn't see anyone around, so I just left the building. I got in my truck, and started the drive back home. I felt dejected. I was honestly hopeful that this would have been my one solid chance to end my contractor career and become a government employee. 

When I was about 3 minutes from my home, my mobile rang. I answered the call, and it was the supervisor of the area I had put in for. In short order, he told me that this is my one chance to sell myself, that if I really want the position, they'll hold the interview spot open for me and give me a chance. I flipped a U-turn so fast and sped all the way back to the base and got to the building real quick! Upon entry to the building, I was greeted in the foyer by the supervisor who expressed his joy in seeing me return. We make our way to the conference room, where I meet the two others who are to interview me. Since I didn't fill out my questionnaire, they ask me to just go over my experience and what I've done over the years. They explain a bit about the program that they are looking to fill the position for. Without going in to too much information, it's a project that utilizes the skills I've picked up working on ODXC's and MSPP's with my soon-to-be former role. 

I relay that I've done everything from working as a tier 1 technician on help desk for the Air Force to a network engineer for the Army. I'd been to bases all across the country and a few outside of the country. I had spearheaded some big projects on previous contracts, and seen them come to fruition, on time and under budget. I state that all the certifications I've earned I earned on my own time, without attending any formal classes or seminars. Pretty much, I sold myself as best as I could, probably better than I ever have in all of the interviews I've ever had.

I finish and answer a couple of probing questions (things along what I like to do in my downtime, and the like). They'd let it be known that out of all the candidates that they'd interviewed so far, I was the only one that had any experience with transport level technology. After that, they thank me for my time and I went on my way. 

The rest of the month of April passes, and then May starts on strong. The first two weeks of May, I hadn't heard anything one way or the other about the position. And then, midway through the month, I get an email offering the position to me. 

I was gobsmacked. I'd literally walked away from the interview after writing on their questionnaire that I didn't think I'd be good fit. I'd hoped, but wasn't certain, that I'd sold myself in a spectacular fashion when I did go back. But, there it was! Sure as I am an idiot at times, as an email saying that the position was mine! If I recall correctly, I think my wife was cheering loudly for a bit, I can't recall because I was so stunned.

I'm finishing out my last week right now. I find it ironic that my last day is on the 4^(th) of July. I'll be riding home at night on my motorcycle with fireworks going off all above me.

&amp;#x200B;

The TL;DR of this post is this: Don't sell yourself short, especially as a tech. Take that chance to move up to something new. More importantly, make sure you have something to bring to the table, so tackle a new skill-set or pick up a new cert. Y'all are badasses in my eyes. Also, sorry if this doesn't fit 100% in the TFTS community. I've followed many of you through your postings and I've had a few of you follow me on some of mine. I felt that if anyone would appreciate this post, it'd be this community.",talesfromtechsupport,1057,1562199268

Lady: I didn't drop it ! My son told me i could use my laptop without a screen. So i removed it !

Me: (dumbfounded) : Herm...what !?!?! You removed the screen... How ?!?!

Lady: I pulled on it until it came out and cut the little wire, it's not booting anymore can you fix it.

Me: (at lost for word, trying not the laugh): Miss you can't remove a screen like that, i don't think there's any chance i can make boot again !

Lady: But my son told me i could use without the screen and i could plug it on my tv.

Me: Well that's true but you still don't have to remove the screen to make that happen. There's nothing i can do to fix it. But  I can remove the hard drive and put in an external hard drive casing so you caould access your data.

Lady: Oh thank you i didn't want to lose my work. Well at least i can use the screen as a tablet now.

Me: Humm no the screen is useless now.

Lady: But my son use his laptop screen like a tablet !

Me: Well i don't what hardware he have at home but there's hybrid tablet/laptop that exist and they can do that. But this not an option for your laptop.

Lady: BUT what can i do with my laptop.

Capt_Miller,How I learned that you can brick iPads by cheating on popular apps.,"Ok, I'll try to keep this one short. It's a story I've been meaning to tell to you guys for a while now. It's not *technically* tech support, so if it doesn't fit this sub please let me know.  

I used to work for a fairly large tech retail chain in the Netherlands like 3 - 4 years ago. We sold tablets, laptops, smartphones, stuff like that, also Apple products. It was a quiet afternoon, weekday, so not much to do but stand around and watch wacky videos on our 4k iMacs.  

Cue a dad walking in with his I think about 10-years-old son. They approached me and politely asked for help.  

&gt; Dad: ""Tell the nice man what happened.""  
&gt; Kid: ""Everytime I try to launch an app on my iPad it just goes back to the home screen.""  
&gt; Me: ""Hmm, that's odd. I can look into it for you but please note that we do charge a fee of €25,- for service if it turns out to take longer than a few minutes.""  
&gt; Dad: ""Ok, sure. Just fix it please.""  

My boss was in the store as well, so I told him I'd be busy with this customer and started looking into what the issue could be. The kid was right. Every time you tried to start an app or even get into the settings menu or whatever, the iPad would instantly close the app and return to the home screen. There was no visible damage to the device. It even had one of those huge foam covers around it.  

&gt; Me: ""Well, I can't see what's causing your issue right now. I'll go into the back and see what we can do for you. Please wait here.""
&gt; Dad: ""Ok, do you think it's serious?""
&gt; Me: ""Don't know yet, but if it turns out to be serious there is not much we can do, we can send it to a repair company for you but they'll just send it back unrepaired since it's probably a software issue.""  
&gt; Dad: ""Damn, well ok. Have a look then.""  

I took the iPad to the back. First order of business was, af course: Google the problem. Lo and behold: one of the first results I found was a page explaining how some kid had bricked his iPad trying to cheat a popular app about crushing various colours of candy. Turns out that by not starting the app for a while, you could get points you needed to buy lives and stuff. By reverting the years on the device way back, waiting for the battery to die, and then restarting your device and putting it on the current date and time you could trick the app into giving you a whole heap of points because it thought you hadn't launched it in years. Turns out this kid tried to take that cheat to max level and reverted his iPad to the earliest possible date; Jan 1st, 1970 - causing the infamous 1970 iPad bug.  

I returned to the store to find the dad and kid impatiently waiting for me.  

&gt;Dad: ""Did you fix it?""  
&gt;Me: ""Well, no, I can't. I'm very sorry. But I think I do know what caused the problem.""  
&gt;Dad: ""Well then, what is it?""  
&gt;Me, turning to kid: ""Do you play [popular app]?""  
&gt;Kid, realising he's busted: ""...yes.""  
&gt;Me: ""And did you try to *cheat* the app?""  
&gt;Kid: ""...yes.""  
&gt;Me, turning to dad: ""He reverted the date on your device to 1970, causing the iPad software to break. Depleting the battery completely might fix the problem. If it doesn't, you'll need to bring it to an official Apple store to see if they can fix it."" (side note: there's only a handful of those in the Netherlands, many of them far away from our little town.)  
&gt;Dad, turning to kid: ""[insert angry Turkish yelling at kid]""
&gt;Me: ""Sir, I'm sorry but I'll have to charge the service fee.""  
&gt;Dad: ""THIS IS COMING OUT OF YOUR ALLOWANCE, [SON NAME]! YOU WON'T BE SEEING THAT IPAD FOR WEEKS!""  

They leave the store after paying the fee, the dad still angrily mumbling to the son, never to be seen again. My boss gives me the side-eye, I explain what happens. We both have a good laugh about it for a few minutes and go about our work.",talesfromtechsupport,3114,1562061651
AskTheRealQuestion81,Why doesn’t this air mouse work?,"This isn’t my story, it’s my mom’s. She works in administration at a medical facility. One of her close friends was a nurse there for decades who switched to the office side of things toward the end of her career.

Though my mom isn’t tech support, she had to be that for her friend who’d never really used a mouse on a desktop computer before. Mom said she walked into the friend’s office and she has the mouse in the air aimed at the computer screen and moving it around, so she watches for a second. Then, she starts furiously left and right clicking, so mom finally asks her what I’m the world she’s doing. She said she couldn’t get the mouse to work, that she has it in the air aimed at “the arrow” on the screen, but when she tries to drag it one way or the other it just stayed still. She told my mom the thing just doesn’t work!

After laughing hysterically (not making her friend feel bad, they enjoy laughing at the expense of each other) and her friend joining in, realizing the laughter means she doesn’t have a clue as to what she’s doing, my mom explained it to her. They laughed even harder after that. I always found that to be a really funny story. Oh, and computers were by no means new at this point in time. It was sometime between 2005-2010.

scoldog,"Sysadmining, still sysadmining. I asked for a ticket, and for my sins they gave me one","Monday morning. It was bound to happen eventually, can't avoid it if I tried, so may as well face up to it and stare it down.  

Dragging my butt into the office, still recovering from a weekend of doing absolutely nothing but recovering from the last week. Exhaling the last cold air of dawn from my lungs and breathing in the stale hot air of the office air mixed with the smell of coffee and toast from the early starting staff members.  Making my way to my cubicle, I ignore the frantic hand waving of the human resources (two lies for the price of one) who are begging me to show them how to operate their computers for them since their brains haven't warmed up sufficently to remember how to do their jobs.

And to think I share the road in the morning with these people.

I arrive at my cubicle, my tiny corner of refuge, my Fortress of Solitude that hundreds of people know about.  Firing up the computer, I again mentally toy with the idea of make a false carboard wall to disguise my cubicle as a storage room of cardboard boxes.  The computer on, I log in and start dealing with the email and trouble tickets from the weekend while my phone starts ringing (I swear these people watch me on hidden cameras waiting for me to sit down).

I fight my way through the weekend spam buildup, and make my way to the trouble tickets.  First one in the queue is from one of our Branch Managers on Sunday.

BRANCHMGR:  ""USER has finished with us today (Sunday).  Please disable his access ASAP""

OK, nothing like starting the day with a employee deletion, even if this user wasn't one of the bad ones.  Better than a cappuccino enema some would say.

Started employee termination proceedings.  No need to refer to the instructions, I wrote them.  Do all the necessary changes in our sales system, change and disable AD and backup then delete the users Exchange mailbox.  Just as I hit the delete button to finalise the user deletion, the ticket queue dinged.  I watched as the final step processed telling me the user had been totally deleted, then tabbed to the ticketing queue.  The Branch Manager had sent an update.

BRANCHMGR: ""I made a mistake.  USER doesn't finished up till tomorrow (Tuesday).  Can you please reinstate his access as he can't get into his computer.""

That's it, FML, Monday morning had won already, and it was so early in the game.  I went outside to stand in the slowly warming sun, toasted a ""well done"" to Monday with my hot chocolate and wished for a cigarette even though I have never smoked in my life.",talesfromtechsupport,879,1561953226

However they actually did a good job by sending a screenshot of the error so I decided to try and help.  This is all done via email.

Users Supervisor:   PF can you help with this error?

Me:  Is the $*Generic Check Scanning software* running?   My first suggestion would be to restart the computer and the check scanner.   Then try again.   If that doesn't work contact $*Generic Bank Support*.   If they need assistance for anything with elevated privileges I can be reached at $extension.

User: it has been reset and Manager had other user unplug it and plug it back in but it didn't fix it.

Users Supervisor:   I'm on the phone with $*Generic Bank Support* now.

Users Supervisor:   The solution was to unplug the check scanner then plug it back in.  

&amp;#x200B;

Me:  ----Rage Face-----

&amp;#x200B;

My Boss:  (who was cc'd on all of these emails) For future reference ""restart the check scanner"" as mentioned in the initial response from PF means to unplug the power from the scanner and then plug the power back into the scanner.  Although it sometimes seems cliche to ""try turning it off and on again"", it is occasionally the proper corrective step in troubleshooting, especially when directed to do so by support staff; perhaps ultimately reducing the number of emails from 12 to 3 or less and freeing up some time and effort to perform other duties.   Or you could even try calling us and probably get it resolved in a fraction of the time it takes to write the initial email as we are usually here and usually answer the phone.

TheSidewalkRunner,“I thought you guys were busy” - A Cautionary Tale,"I worked for a fairly popular law firm years ago as the Tech Support Specialist (my actual title). The firm had about 100 users consisting primarily of lawyers and their secretaries. Being in the legal sector, we pretty much gave assistance to whatever issue the users had immediately. Didn’t matter if you called, emailed, texted, smoke signalled, carrier pidgeoned, whatever; we were ready to fix problems right when they happened, and we were on call too. 

The secretaries did a ton of important legal document processing and the sort. Because of the highly sensitive nature of what they handled, they were all required to save their work on one of our several network shares, not on their local hard drive. Some did save certain things locally that were usually not critical or anything, but we always told them that our network shares were backed up regularly, but not their laptops (prohibitively expensive).

Enter the crashed hard drive.

Phone call comes in

Secretary: Hey, tech support?! Uhmm…. Yeah. My computer isn’t booting up and I hear some weird clicking noise. 

Me: The clicking noise is coming from the laptop? 

S: Yes!

I go to investigate and informed her that the hard drive has failed and needs replacement. She asked if I can get the data off of her hard drive; I figured she probably had some pictures or music saved and didn’t want to lose it. Turns out the hard drive wasn’t readable in the slightest. 

The plot thickens.

M: Hey. Just letting you know that we tried to get the data off and couldn’t do it. The drive is unreadable.

S: But I have 2 weeks worth of work saved on it! I have a document I need done tomorrow!!!

M: All that stuff should be on the network shares. You can access it on another machine.

S: I saved it in My Documents. You mean there?

M: No. That’s locally on your hard drive. I mean the network shares on our servers where we all store everything. 

S: Oh, that shortcut had a red X on it and wasn’t working, so I just saved it in My Documents.

M: …..when did it start that?

S: Oh sometime last month. I thought you guys were really busy and didn’t want to make it a big deal. 

M: …..

Explaining this to her boss was not a fun time, especially the part about costing $500+ to send the drive to a data lab with no guarantee of data recovery. If I recall correctly, she ultimately ended up leaving the company a short time later. 

To put it all in to perspective, I offer these bits of knowledge:

	1. Backups. Backups. Backups.
	2. If we don’t KNOW the problem, we can’t FIX the problem.
	3. Not everything that fails can be resurrected.

It's 1995, I'm a broke college student and I'm starting an ISP with an unscrupulous and cheap businessman. What could go wrong?
  
I get Ivan to agree to a budget of around $3,000. This will buy two used Macs and all the RAM and hard drives I can shove into the cases. I install web, mail, FTP and FileMaker (all with, erm, borrowed licenses). A little bit of testing in Ivan's office confirms that, well, Mac OS 7.5 isn't exactly _stable_ so I install two Rebound! automagic rebooters. They exploit a quirk of the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), the proprietary keyboard and mouse connector that eventually was replaced with USB in the iMac a few years later.  
  
In ADB, the Mac regularly queries the keyboard and mouse. If the OS freezes, this process stops. The Rebound! listens for the queries and if they stop for a few seconds, it sends the Control, Command, Power three finger salute to reboot the system.  
  
It's a kluge but it will keep my webserver running without much human intervention.  
  
Now, all I need is cheap and fast Internet. I'm planning on doing something with my college friend Will. Will works part time as a network engineer for my school. He's not very diligent nor well paid, but he is crafty.  
  
Last year, he ran ethernet from an adjacent college building to his second floor apartment, giving him the fastest residential Internet available. He soon used stolen network gear to support a dozen servers which kept his apartment toasty in the winter.   
  
Later, a roommate moved out and he moved all the servers into the vacant bedroom and he started charging for the service. I got him through Economics 1001 so he could keep his scholarship, so he should be amenable to a discount on pricing.
  
I pack up some clothes and drive back to the city. I get to my apartment in the city around 8pm. Markus, my rich kid stoner roommate has parked his truck blocking the one remaining parking spot and the back door to our building. I've got to park a few blocks away while carrying two full size towers to the apartment, then walk up to the fourth floor.  
  
Marijuana smoke billows out of the door when I open it. Markus is sprawled in a beanbag chair on the floor. He's blasting Enya,smoking from a massive bong and wearing a Burger King paper crown.  
  
me:""Nice look, Markus""  
  
Markus:""Thanks. I had a hard weekend. One of my Dad's Burger Kings is getting demolished""  
  
me:""As a threat to good hamburgers?""  
  
Markus:""No- the foundation was poured incorrectly. Since they built it, they're buying it back from him. They'll sit on it until the real estate goes up in value, then knock it down""  
  
me:""So it'll just be an eyesore in the suburbs for a while?""  
  
Markus:""Worse. Dad just locked up one day, gave the crew other jobs and turned off the water and power at the end of a shift""  
  
me:""That's even more unpleasant. Remind me to never go in there. Could you help me schlep these towers over to Will's? I'll buy you a six-pack at the packy""  
  
Markus:""Sure""  
  
On the several block walk to Will's apartment/low rent colocation facility, Markus and I make the executive decision to buy beer on the way. It's sweltering in the city.  
  
I have to lean on the buzzer for a minute or two to get Will to sullenly open the door and let us in. He does seem to appreciate being handed a cold beer for the climb back up the stairs to his apartment.  
  
If it was hot outside, it's not too bad inside Will's apartment. Will has supplemented the anemic central air with window air-conditioners. There are PCs everywhere, some open and partially disassembled, some running. Some are on the floor, others are shoved into pressboard bookshelves leaning against the weight. This place would make a fire marshal or OSHA spit blood.  
  
Will's roommate, Kevin, takes one look at my two Mac towers, open beers and decides that it's time to take a stand.   
  
Kevin:""No. No more shit. Get out""  
  
I turn to Will.   
  
me:""Hey, I'll pay you. Cash. Every month.""  
  
Kevin:""NO!""  
  
Will:""No, man. Just can't do any more""  
  
me (turning to Kevin):""What if I could organize all this so that it's neat, clean and safe?""   
  
Markus:""Ha!""    
  
me:""I'll put all this gear in proper shelves, get it back in the spare room, and pay you $75 a month. You won't even have to admin these things""  
  
Will looks around, shrugs his shoulders and nods.  
  
I find a relatively clean and clear corner and start looking for power and ethernet to plug into my two Macs.   
  
Kevin:""No. You clean all this up and _then_ you can set up""  
  
me:""Fine. I'm going to Micro Center and getting some stuff. I'll be back in a bit and I'll get started""  
  
I walk out, with Markus following with an amused look on his face.  
  
On the way back to the liquor store, I put together my plan.  
  
me:""Markus, do you have the keys to your Dad's Burger King and can I borrow your truck for a few hours?""",talesfromtechsupport,1094,1561701206
Petermagiccheese,When Client's IT team is on your side,"Long time reader first time poster. Nice to see everybody.

&amp;#x200B;

So this would've started back in November of 2018, I had just started a job at #learningsoftwarecompany that September, and was relatively new to everything but was starting to get hold of my position. #Learningsoftwarecompany (which I will refer to as #LSC from here on) sold both courses and platforms for several client companies to assign to their employees for on-boarding training, legal compliance, extra curricular training, and basic ""how to""s on anything from AWS to Facebook. It should also be mentioned that as #LSC had clients both in the fortune 500 and the fortune 100 market, we were are pretty large company, with a few child companies we had bought of the years for various reasons, the important of which for this story is One company we bought out based in France, we'll call this FrenchLearningSoftwareCompany (#FLSC)

&amp;#x200B;

I had been hired on this job as one of our Language Support Tier 1 representatives, since growing up on the East Coast of Canada and working several government jobs before this I was fluent in both French and English. Up until November our team at the Customer Support Centre only handled password resets and the such for #FLSC, anything more then that would be sent to a team of 3 Engineers in #FLSC's headquarters. Early November our Customer Support Manager (#Man) called both myself and the pother French Tier 1 into the VPs office for meeting (Being the newbie I was confused to say the least). We were informed that we would be taking over most of the integration work for #FLSC as they were now without their team of 3 Engineers, wherein 1 of them quit, one of them went on educational leave, and one of them had been let go recently, as part of the reason it was so urgent we took his work over was because he had done virtually nothing since August, and there was a back log of cases to deal with. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of these cases was more long winded then others. The Client (#Client M) accessed #FLSC's courses through  their own Third Party Platform (TPLMS, Third Party Learning Management System), A very common occurrence in our company but when clicking on the link on their TPLMS, they were brought to our page but asked for a direct login to #FLSC site, which of course they would not have as they are intended to be redirected seamlessly. Early December the HR director (#Catbert) for emailed us complaining that the issue had not been fixed for a month and that she was furious and was going to sue for compensation. Rather harsh, but given the situation I didn't entirely blame her for her malcontent. We had been working through several cases like this including her own, and I was used to this by now. At this point a apologized for the wait and setup a call and screenshare meeting with their head of IT (#Dilbert). Dilbert and I had our call, Gathered some information, discussed it with our IT team and came to a solution. The issue ended being due to a cookies policy used by the client's Network on IE 11. We let #Dilbert know what to do to fix the issue, and asked that he call us back if it did not work. 2 weeks pass, and #Catbert emails again, with her Sales Rep Copied, as well as #Dilbert. #Catbert is furious as apparently the issue is still happening and nothing has been fixed. We immediately reply mentioning we were waiting on a reply from #Dilbert to see if the fix we had given them had worked. Not long after #Dilbert also replies on the email chain, mentioning that as far as he was concerned the issue was fixed, and for #Catbert to make sure they speak to him before reporting an issue to #FLSC (+1 for #Dilbert). I setup another call with #Dilbert, as it turned out this was a separate issue that #Dilbert and I solved right there own the phone. Skip to 3 weeks later. #Catbert is emailing again and to put a translation of what she said ""Thank you for letting us know how you will be compensating us for the lack of service"". #Catbert had provided a screenshot from a end user, however before I could even touch it another email comes in on the same chain from #Dilbert, addressing #Catbert. #Dilbert mentions that He is not replicating this problem from within their Network, and judging from the screenshot this was a browser cache issue. #Dilbert advises #Catbert again that she should be going through him first before sending harsh emails to us, as he is perfectly capable of handling a caching issue himself. Slightly difficult to translate the tone to English but He was essentially telling her off. That was the last of that cases issue. A couple weeks later we received confirmation from #Dilbert that everything was working as expected. I like #Dilbert

Genosis79,"""My Computer is Angry with Me!""","First time post here, but had this one in my repertoire for quite some time and figured I'd share.

&amp;#x200B;

So, years ago when I worked as tech support for a popular dial-up service in the early 2000's, I get this call from a kindly-sounding old lady who is trying to connect to the internet. However, her ""Computer gets very angry"" with her when she tries to connect. Umm. Ok? I try to help her out anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I begin with ""Let's go over your settings"", so I run down her setup checking the init string (a set of characters that determine settings for her modem). Maybe her dial-up modem was making weird sounds and freaked her out? Who knows. Then I get to her dial-in number to the service (which typically is a local number to the user, who happened to be in New York), and I check it against my list and realized it was off by a couple numbers. ""There, that should fix it right up."" I could have just ended the call, and asked her to call back if she had any other issues. But, curiosity gnawed at me, I had to know.

&amp;#x200B;

""Ma'am, I have to ask.. why did you think your computer was angry at you?"". ""Well"" she says, ""when I tried to connect, the computer gets quite angry, and very rude and calls me all sorts of names, like 'crazy b\*tch', and demands I stop calling. I'm just trying to connect to the internet to check my mail!"". It dawns on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many internal modems have a speaker, and tend to default to being on so you can hear the connection sounds. Hell, I got to the point I could diagnose their issue just by listening to it. So, this lady dials the wrong number in New York and this random guy, who probably is tired of his phone ringing over and over again, screams into the phone ""STOP calling me you f\*ing b\*tch!."" Which, of course, would travel right out of her computer case from her internal modem instead of the usual squeals and pops in response.

&amp;#x200B;

I mute for a moment to ponder my response, and compose myself. ""I see"", I managed to say without cracking my voice too much. ""well, your computer has likely forgiven you now, and you can go check your mail. Have a lovely evening, ma'am"". 

&amp;#x200B;

In retrospect, I don't know if this guy assume it was a woman calling him, or just calls everyone ""b\*itch"". ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Perhaps months of people getting that number wrong and squealing their computers in his ear has broke him.",talesfromtechsupport,614,1561557847
MagorTuga,Literally just hold the power button,"First time posting here, I pray I can please or at least amuse my Tech Overlords with this short story of mine.


I'm doing an internship at a tech company. Where I'm at, we mostly install Windows and setup workstations while the remaining departments provide the actual tech support. 

We also pickup malfunctioning equipments to take in, or fix them on the spot, if possible.


Me and and co-worker (Co) are going around the city picking up and delivering stuff along the way, mind you, each location is like a 15 minute trip on the highway away from one another.


We arrive at a warehouse, where we're greeted by a lady.



Lady: Thanks for coming so quickly, we got a PDA that's not working.


Co: This one? (Picks up PDA, fiddles with it)


Lady: Yes, we've tried everything, charged the battery, switched the battery with the other PDA, tried turning it on multiples times, nothing!


Co: Alright, I'll bring it in then, you'll probably have it fixed in a week. In the meantime, I'l try to get you a replacement, alright?


Lady: You see, we only have one working PDA now (makes gesture towards tall shelves filled with packages) and I don't want to have just a single person working on all of this. Don't you have any other clients who we can borrow a PDA from?


Co: Yeah, I don't know, I'll have to see about it. Have a nice day!



We leave. As we're getting on the car, co-worker handles me the PDA, we drive off.




Me: So, which one is the power button?


Co: The red one.


Me: (Holds power button for 10 seconds)


PDA: (Turns on)


Co: (Surprised Pikachu face)



We do a U-Turn, Co takes the credit on the spot for fixing it, talking about soft-resetting and whatevers, we arrive back at our company and Co then tells everyone I fixed it.



Overall, that moment made up for me arriving home like 2 hours late.

Now, the agent wrote ""customer ate the DSL cable, refuses to buy a new one, wants to talk to a manager""

NOPE. The call went something like this

Me: me. Never worked in IT
Aussie: nice but stubborn and convinced I know how to fix things for some reason. Has known my parents since the day I was born (almost exactly) when they started going to my church.

So there I was, middle of my work day. Not to play the sympathy card, but I’m tired. Wife’s on week 3 of horrific morning sickness. I've got her sprawled out on a mattress in the living room with Gatorade, Oblivion, and a puke bowl.

I work at home, we have a 2 year old, so my day looks like work/work/work/ poopy diaper break/ work/work/work *pause to switch laundry* clean puke bowl. “leave work” run to store with list of pregnancy friendly meds, ect

Suffice to say, I’m busy and tired.

So middle of my work day, battling it out with website widget button redirects, and my phone rings.

It’s Aussie. 

“Me! I bought a new printer. It’s super nice, touchscreen, ect… but it’s supposed to scan to email. I can’t get it to work, can you set it up for me? I really need this to work”

*Internal screaming as widget button refuses to save and backend crashes again. Noticed toddler licking a wall outlet while wife dry heaves*

“Well Aussie, I’ve never set up a printer, but what’s it’s make/model”

“Oh it’s a _______.”

“ok! Well I’m finding a ton of YouTube videos about how to set this up, it’s supposed to be really simple and –“

“oh I tried watching those, I can’t follow at all. Can you just come over?”

*Oh FFS* deep breath. Say yes slowly

“Well Aussie, I still have +3 hours of work left, so I can’t even look this up any further until then”

“Oh your still at work! I though you were done.” 

*Checks clock. At 1:45??? In what world*

“well Aussie, let me see what I can find.”

I research the problem before running to the store for ginger, some tummy meds, milk, and lime flavored chips since that’s what the baby wants. I send Aussie a 5 step summary of the extremely simple process that I found online.

Next day:

“So can you come over and help?”

“Well, I’m babysitting (3 nephews) today since my sister is wrapping up her organic 3d printing project, did you try those steps? Which one did you get stuck on?”

“Oh, I guess I can try those”

*Facepalming intensifies*

Several hours later

“Please come over, I’ll compensate you!”
I ignore it, since I’m down for the day and Frankly exhausted.

Today, he corners me at church

“me, please just come over! I asked (other friend who also isn’t an IT professional) to look, and she was stumped!”

“Well Aussie, what was the issue that you got stuck on?”

“oh, I had to enter a password.”

…..

“Just please come over me, it will probably take you only 30 seconds.”

So now I’m googling how to reset a brother printer password.

pidude314,No Need To Ask The Guy Who Manages The Server,"LTL-FTP.

Background:

I'm a System Engineer for a company that makes software for a different organization. My main job is patching and maintaining virtual machines that are located on servers in another part of the country. The people in that other part of the country manage the servers and have control over the resources my VMs use. One of the VMs uses an automated build and release suite. Another VM is set up for code analysis as part of that build process.

&amp;#x200B;

Cast:

Me = Me

Dev = one of the developers who relies on the two aforementioned VMs

Boss = Our supervisor who has no technical background. Rumor has it he used to be a manager at a bank.

SE = Senior system engineer. Also kind of my supervisor. Doesn't get along with Boss.

Server Dudes = The people in a different part of the country who manage the physical servers

&amp;#x200B;

Story:

Dev walks into my office. ""Hey Me, just thought you should know that all my builds are failing and the error code says something about $codeAnalysisProgram.""

Me, ""Okay, let me just go to the web client for it and see what's up.""

 ERR\_CONNECTION\_TIMED\_OUT 

Thinking to myself, ""What the hell? Maybe the server got rebooted and the service didn't start back up.""

To Dev, ""Well since the code analysis not working is holding you back, I'll remove it from the build process until I fix it so you can keep doing your code wizardry.""

So I do that as a quick fix while I troubleshoot. Boss gets upset when anything gets in the way of ""Continuous Development/Continuous Integration"" and wouldn't stand for new builds being held up by code analysis. Now I try to remote into the VM to start the service back up.

Remote Desktop cannot connect to this computer for one of these reasons... blah, blah, probably turned off, blah

Alright, no big deal, I'll just check out the VM management web client.

I go to the website.

I login.

I allow flash.

&amp;#x200B;

The server isn't listed.

Wat?

I walk over to SE's office. ""Hey SE, Server Dudes wouldn't just delete a VM without talking to us, right?""

SE, ""I don't know, probably. Why? Did they?""

Me, ""Well it looks like the code analysis VM just disappeared. So I'd say yeah.""

SE, ""You should probably go talk to Boss. I know he was talking to Server Dudes earlier about something.""

So I wander on down the hallway to Boss's office. ""Hey Boss, would you happen to know anything about Server Dudes deleting a VM recently?""

Boss, ""Yeah, I told them to delete one that didn't do anything. Why?""

Me, ""About that. That VM was running our code analysis on it.""

Boss, ""What do you mean? In this spreadsheet that only I use and/or know about, it says that VM doesn't do anything.""

Me, ""Well maybe next time you should ask the person who manages the VM instead of asking your spreadsheet.""

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Boss deletes a VM because he didn't think to ask anyone if it did anything. Causes build failures for code.",talesfromtechsupport,773,1561144538
marcan42,Keyboard Exists Between Keyboard And Chair,"Here I was yesterday, enjoying my afternoon, when all of a sudden a certain $User called me.

$User owns a Korg Kronos, which is a rather complex and full-featured music synthesizer workstation. That is, a big piano keyboard, a touchscreen, lots of knobs, buttons, and LEDs, USB and network connectivity, digital and analog audio input/output, etc. This beast has [nested tabs within tabs within tabs](https://mrcn.st/t/kronos_sc1.png) of settings. It's a pretty big ordeal to figure out how something is currently configured that you don't quite know the details about.

$User was playing some simple piano music when all of a sudden, they explained, the entire keyboard shifted an octave lower. It's as if they had started playing one full octave (12 notes) to the left of where they were on the keyboard. They hadn't pressed any buttons or done anything explicit. It just happened randomly. Changing instruments (which discards any changes made) fixed the problem, but it would just happen again later.

I checked out the keyboard, which was currently in that strange state, and started digging through the menus. Synth transpose? No, that's set to zero. Octave shift for the main synthesizer engine? Nope, also 0. Master transpose? Zero. Transpose (which shifts the keyboard by some number of notes) was mapped to a slider on the front panel, but that was solidly in its center position, and moving it did what it was intended to do. Of course I could move the slider all the way up (12 notes up) and that would cancel out the problem, but that wasn't fixing the underlying cause.

The Kronos has a feature called ""compare"" that allows you to back out any changes that you have made to the current configuration, and temporarily go back to the stored settings for the currently selected instrument; pressing the ""compare"" button again restores modified settings. So I pressed the button, and as one might expect, the keyboard went back to normal. Pressed it again, and it went back to shifted an octave lower. Okay, so that means I just need to tap through menus while clicking that button, and if I see anything change, bingo, there's my problem.

10 minutes later, I found nothing. Rats. Okay, time to break out the big guns.

Pretty much any modern synthesizer supports MIDI, a standard for communicating music data between instruments, or instruments and computers. MIDI has some basic messages like ""note was pressed"" ""note was released"" ""pitch bend knob was turned"", as well as a generic ""controller change"" message that just means some knob or setting (numbered from 0 to 127) was changed to some value (from 0 to 127). Since synths have gotten *way* more complicated than 127 parameters these days, MIDI provides an extension mechanism called ""system exclusive"" (SysEx). That's basically an arbitrary message that is just a bunch of 7-bit data values, of arbitrary length, the meaning of which is completely up to each manufacturer. It's a catch-all ""proprietary settings go here"" message. The Kronos, being a monstrous beast of a synthesizer, uses system exclusive messages to transfer basically all of its configuration. Anything you do on the interface ought to translate to a system exclusive message (unless it's one of the few fundamental settings that are assigned to the 127 basic controllers).

Pressing the ""compare"" button, since it basically resets all the instrument settings to a prior state, also should send a massive SysEx message with all the settings. So I logged in to the computer that was attached to the Kronos via USB (which includes a MIDI interface), and started up a tool to dump all MIDI messages out to the screen. Indeed, pressing the compare button dumped a huge screenful of data out. I clicked it repeatedly, toggling between the good and bad states, trying to find any bytes that changed, but nothing stood out. It was identical.

Okay, so maybe the SysEx dump that gets sent is a bit incomplete, and even though that button resets all the settings, maybe the huge single-message MIDI dump that it sends isn't *quite* comprehensive and misses the important part that changes. So, how about I go back to the proper config, and start playing some music, and see if the problem happens again?

So I did that, and I was playing along, seeing all my ""note on""s and ""note off""s on the screen, when all of a sudden everything shifted down an octave again. I scrolled back a few lines and saw this

    F0 42 30 68 43 1A 00 00 06 00 00 00 01 F7

Okay. What the heck is that? All SysEx messages start with `F0` and end with `F7`. The bytes at the beginning probably specify which setting was changed, and that `01` at the end is probably the value. So `00` is probably normal. Let's try that hypothesis:

    $ send_midi 24:0 SYSEX,F0,42,30,68,43,1A,00,00,06,00,00,00,00,F7

Yup, that made things to back to normal.

    $ send_midi 24:0 SYSEX,F0,42,30,68,43,1A,00,00,06,00,00,00,01,F7

And that made the keyboard shift again.

But what *is* that setting? What the hell makes it go off randomly? Time to get the documentation.

Korg's SysEx documentation is a pile of text files with, shall we say, less than stellar organization. The first table is a list of ""Function codes"" for the 5th byte, which says:

    |  43  | Parameter Change (integer)               |Receive/Transmit|

    [43] Parameter Change (integer)                                           Receive/Transmit
            F0, 42, 3g, 68          Excl Header
            43                      Function
            TYP                     part of parameter id (see combi.txt, etc)
            SOC                     part of parameter id (see combi.txt, etc)
            SUB                     part of parameter id (see combi.txt, etc)
            PID                     part of parameter id (see combi.txt, etc)
            IDX                     part of parameter id (see combi.txt, etc)
            valueH                  Value   (bit14-20)   (*4)
            valueM                  Value   (bit7-13)    (*4)
            valueL                  Value   (bit0-6)     (*4)
            F7                      End of Excl

Okay, so that fits. Now what's TYP=1A? Well, there's no table for TYP... there are a bunch of separate text files that list the type byte values in separate sections, with no grouping of where I should look. I spent some time digging through, until I finally found that `1A` is ""Controller Info"" in Program.txt. So it's changing a controller - controller #6, which comes a few bytes later. And then there's a ""Controller Info"" table, which says...

     param   index        value                      name
    -----  ------  -----------------  --------------------------------
        6    0..1               0..1  Panel Switch State

""Panel Switch State""? Like all the switches on the main panel of the Kronos, to the left of the screen? I checked all those on the controllers screen, and nothing was hitting those. Wait. No, what Korg calls the ""switches"" (SW1 and SW2) are *specifically* a pair of buttons on top of the joystick that's to the left of the keyboard...

I look to the left and spot the Bluetooth computer keyboard sitting on top of the Kronos. Resting neatly on top of SW1. The SW1 that, in the default piano patches, is configured to shift everything down an octave. The switch with an LED indicator, which is the only way to tell its current status, as it is not otherwise shown in the UI (unlike the bank of controller switches/knobs to the left of the screen, which is). The LED indicator that was conveniently hidden by the bluetooth keyboard sitting on top.

I quietly picked up the Bluetooth keyboard, placed it on the adjacent desk, and walked away.

tinaksitee,Did not expect users to be this stupid,"Hey hi hello, newbie here! Just started my first IT-job as a tech support and after two months I already have couple of facepalm-worthy stories. 

The company I'm currently working at has around 300 users and the IT-department has separate team for server maintenance and team for general technical problems - where I'm located. Overall it has been real nice, users are mainly friendly and understanding because I'm a new face around here, but every now and then I have encountered shitty behavior and some very bias comments regarding me being a woman and working in IT (all these came from other women).

&amp;#x200B;

**1 - The Silent Skype**

This one was just plain funny, to me at least. User calls and complains that her Skype is all broken and useless - she can't hear anything through her headset and the other end couldn't hear her either. ""It worked this morning before I took the laptop to a meeting with me and unplugged the headset"", she said.

I went to her office to see whats up, she explains that the USB plug won't even fit to the computer anymore! I unplug the headset, turn the USB around, plug it in again, it fits and behold: MAGIC! Skype works again!

&amp;#x200B;

**2 - ""Do I Really Have To Press That Everytime?!?""**

Sidenote: In our company, every user has a laptop, dock, one or two screens and of course a keyboard and a mouse.

The woman of the story is known to be a tedious one, she is always bitchy and don't know how to use any kind of device, so we have to deal with her A LOT. For the sake of this story, lets call her Karen.

Karen came up and complained that her keyboard doesn't work at all and that it is very important that we make it work IMMEDIATELY. My co-workers were busy so I went with her and she was not pleased.

&gt;Karen: Oh, so I got YOU? \*scans me from head to toe\*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yes but I'm sure that I will get it fixed in no time though!  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: \*shakes her head\* Are you even educated for this job?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Well yeah, I'm soon to be MSc in Information Technology  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: Well you sure don't look like that.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ....

We get to her office and I start troubleshooting. She went to get coffee since ""it's probably is gonna take a while \*side eye\*"". I look through the device manager and see that one of the docks USB ports says unknown device, so I just switched ports with the mouse and everything worked again. To be sure, I rebooted the computer, just to see if the problem would appear again. No, all fine and dandy. I went to get her from the break room and she was very surprised and skeptical.

&gt;Me: Hey, everything is working again, the dock just didn't recognize the keyboard for some reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: You fixed it? Well I bet it won't work again if I reboot the computer, you just don't do your work properly...  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Oh, I rebooted it, just in case, and everything is working.  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: You didn't do it properly, let me do it  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Sure!  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: \*instead of pressing restart, she presses shutdown and shuts the whole computer, waits the screens to wake up, they don't (because the computer is turned off) and starts violently smash the keyboard to wake the sceens\* SEE IT DOESN'T WORK, I WANT \*name of my older co-worker\* TO COME AND FIX THIS BECAUSE YOU APPARENTLY CAN'T!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: \*goes to the computer, starts it again and shows that the keyboard is in fact, working\* You have to press the power button to start the computer if you turn it off - see?

$me - did you try turning it off and back on again?

$child1 - Yes! I did that! (sound familiar?)

$me- ok, let's go and see.

TrippingThomo,The computer is just full of Sh!t,"I have a few tail from working Tech support in a small Canadian town, if this one does well I may share some of the other gems.


So we were the only computer repair shop in town, and most of my days were spend running malware removal tools, cleaning 5 years of dust out of CPU fan and heat sinks, and diagnosing why someones PC was running slow.


For the most part this was an awesome job. My bosses were really lovely people, they allowed me to use the work car on my days off for personal use, and I was living in a beautiful place, I can't complain.


So Karen calls the store and I chat to her. She is a bit rough, so there was always some colorful language when talking to her. 


&gt;Karen : I need you to clean out my computer


&gt;Me : Sure thing, is it just running slow? Or is it complaining that it is running out of space?


&gt;Karen : It's just full of sh!t and I need you to just clean it up.


&gt;Me : OK, sure thing bring it into the shop and I will throw it on the bench and get working on it.


In hind sight, I really should have asked a few more questions.


So Karen brings in her computer, leaves it with my boss, and leaves. Luckily for me (and unluckily for my boss) I went to lunch, so my boss grabbed the computer to get started on it. He started connecting cables to the computer, only the computer smelled horrible! He grabbed a screwdriver and opened up the case, when he removed the side of the case he was greeted with a huge pile of sh!t ... literal sh!t inside the computer case.


Now one of the reasons I loved my bosses is that they didn't take crap from anyone, so he grabbed the computer and took it outside and left it on the ground, he then phones Karen and screamed at her to come pick up the computer and why the hell did it have sh!t in it? Apparently they had the side of the case off, and they had a puppy that needed to go, so it crapped in the computer. She didn't want to clean it and thought we would be happy to do it.


It still boggles my mind that she thought a computer repair company would be happy to remove shit from her computer.",talesfromtechsupport,1090,1560925752
pinky0926,"""This is unbelievable. We should bring you on as a consultant.""","Not so long ago I temped as an admin assistant at a government department between jobs. I learned a few things in this job. For one thing, people really unfairly value your capability by your job title in this public sector especially. I mean, people really talked to me like I was slow, because I was ""the receptionist"". For another, government sector in this part of town is severely underskilled. The ""sys-admin""  was pretty much a guy who I guess had got the job because he had a lot of opinions about which cellphone brand was best. The IT manager was a 60+ year old woman who...well I don't know what she did. But aside from these things (and the pay), the job was pretty great. Low responsibility, low effort, leave at exactly 5 every day.

One day the Admin Manager came to me with a grim face, like it was my time to do the green mile or something. She announced that she had **The Spreadsheet**, which annually required two weeks worth of data entry and usually got lumped on the admin team. I resigned myself to this. It sounded by her description like thousands of lines of names you had to copy into a database from a handwritten sheet or something. 

She sat me down and showed me what we were looking at. As it turned out, **The Spreadsheet** really was a spreadsheet. And even more curiously, it was already full of data. 

**Her:** So in Column A there is a firstname like John, and in column B there is a surname like Smith. You need to put those into one cell, so all of it is just in Column A, like ""John Smith"".
**Me:** Ok. And what else?
Her:** Well once you get done with that, there's also a postcode you need to take out of Column F and put into Column G. 
**Me:** ....Ok. Is this...is this it?
**Her:** Well yes. But as you can see, there are around five thousand rows, so this will take you a while. If you need help or it's taking too long let me know and I'll see if I can spare you an intern. Oh, but you can copy and paste each entry from one place to the next, you know how to do that right? 

I blinked, and digested what I was looking at. Every year, this particular government department paid someone a living wage for 2 weeks or so to type this information out row by row. They had never employed anyone capable or asked anyone if it could be done another way. 

Obviously when I went back into the admin manager's office with a finished spreadsheet an hour later (my excel formula's are a bit rusty), she was gobsmacked, and uttered the line from the title. I felt impressive, until I pinched myself.",talesfromtechsupport,2705,1560869146
gargravarr2112,What is it with office people and heaters?,"Brief one from today. Since teams changed, I'm still the sysadmin, but I now officially belong to the Operations team, which is mostly admin of the office. This is fine by me, as basically anything that uses electricity within the building winds up being my responsibility anyway. Today is no exception.

We sublet our ample office space to another startup company. Generally there's some crossover in our work setups - we both use Slack heavily, both cloud, both employing lots of technical people. We set up a shared Slack channel to coordinate things like deliveries, visitors and office needs between the two companies.

Around lunchtime today, there's a Slack message from the office manager of the sublet:

&gt; $OM: Help, the AC over the main door is blowing hot air!

The sublet has the ground floor while we have the upper floor. Also, there are partition walls dividing up the shared space.

&gt; $me: hey $OM, do you mean the main glass doors to the street? Because that's not an AC, that's a curtain fan heater
&gt; $OM: yes that door. it's far too hot!
&gt; $me: switch it off then :)

I thought that was that. However, 2 hours later, our company office manager walks back into the office after visiting a shop in town:

&gt; $OOM: I seriously cannot believe how hot it is downstairs, it's like a sauna! I had to show $OM how to turn the fan off!
&gt; $me: wait, what, I told them about this *two hours ago*. You mean they've had the heating pumping into their office space for hours on a summer day?
&gt; $OOM: Yeah, $OM did mention they'd talked to you earlier, but they didn't do anything about it...

LiamtheV,"Tales from University Helpdesk: ""No, that's protected by FERPA""","Background: Ferpa, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, prevents me from giving out information on students to anyone who isn't that student. Doesn't matter if that student is a minor, if the requester is paying that student's tuition, etc.   


It also means I can't ask anything of the student either to verify their ID. So when a **$StudentUser** calls in needing a password reset, and they've opted in to FERPA protection, I cannot ask for things like their mailing address, non $university email, registered phone number, etc. For that, I'll have to transfer them to the office of Admissions and Records/Registrar, where they can waive that protection, the Registrar updates the user's file to remove the flag, and then half an hour later the updates have propagated to the systems that I have access to. Super easy, and barely an inconvenience /s.

  
On a weekly basis, I have a user that falls in to one of the above camps. A user that needs a password reset because their parent set up their account for them and selected not to opt out of the FERPA protections calls in:  


""Sorry, I am unable to verify your identity, you have FERPA protections on your account which prevents me from asking for any personal information. I'll have to transfer you to the **$University** Registrar, they can remove that flag if you like""

&amp;#x200B;

""Can't you just look me up with my SSN/DoB/Student ID?""

&amp;#x200B;

""In order to comply with Federal Privacy regulations, I cannot ask for that information. You have that flag on your account, it needs to be removed.""

  
Generally then, they let me transfer it. It's not fun, especially since there's been some back and forth with the $Registrar over what challenge questions we can ask, and what needs to be transferred to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Occasionally, we get a helicopter parent trying to get into their kids' **$MyUniversity** dashboard, which is where you register for classes, pay fees/tuition, access grades and unofficial transcripts, etc. etc. This would also give them access to their kids' **$University** email account. Even if the student is a minor (17 year olds can take courses at $university), we cannot and will not grant someone claiming to be their parent a password reset unless the actual user is there answering the challenge questions.   


""Hi, I need a password reset for **$useraccount""**

**""**Okay, let's check, no FERPA flag present. Can I get your Student ID?""  


""Oh, I don't have their ID. I'm $Parent""  


""Is the student there?""  


""No, but I need to get in to their account""  


""Call us back when $Student is present. Due to Federal Privacy regulations, I cannot grant access or give out any information for that student's account, if Student is present, then *they* can request a pw reset, if they need one.""

Jakovaseur,We unknowingly helped someone commit a crime,"This happenned a few years ago. I work as tech support for a company that sells access control, alarm and video surveillance products. I'm on the phone all day, helping installers with any technical issue they could have with our products. We're only 3 on support calls, so we end up knowing everyone that calls on a regular basis.

There was a very nice old man that was calling us about 2-3 times a week. He was very polite, funny and patient. He was probably in his late 60s judging by the voice and the way he talked. His questions were always about cameras or recorders. He was asking very basic stuff like how to record, getting his cameras online, changing the resolution, connecting remotely, etc. He had no knowledge of basic ipv4 networking or cctv. I didn't think much of it because on rare occasion we would help end users (we're a tech support line for technicians and integrator only). This went on for about two months until he stopped calling us. 

After a year of him not calling us, my colleague said ""You guys remember (first name+last name) ? It's has been a while since he called, I wonder what he's up to.""

So we googled his name and... It turns out he was the owner of a gym in a small town, and he was arrested for filming and recording the women locker room and showers.

DK_The_White,"""But it's never been anywhere near water!""","I just found out this subreddit exists through one of those ""YouTuber reads reddit posts"" videos. I work at (and manage) a cell phone repair shop in a small town, so I've got some good stories for y'all! (American south, so apply the THICCEST southern accents you can to the customer(s).)

A long time ago, a woman brings in two iPhone 6s wanting the screens swapped. She explains that the screen on one worked, but the other didn't, so she wants the one that did work on the phone with the currently non-working screen. Easy. 

Now if you don't know anything about the iPhone 6s and 6s+, they have a rather huge flaw. The motherboard can, without warning (as well as with various causes), suffer a serious malfunction that messes up the backlight circuit. There are a couple ways to fix this, but we're only just now getting started with motherboard repair because holy F good equipment is expensive. 

Well, as it turns out, that's what was happening... to both of them... only this time I knew the cause: water damage to *both phones*. The conversation that ensued still makes me laugh. (CL will be crazy lady, and I'll be Me)


**Me**: Hi, this is Me from CellPhoneRepairShop calling about your phone.

**CL**: Did y'all get it fixed?

**Me**: Well, not exactly. We have some concerns about the phones.

**CL**: What's wrong?

**Me**: Well it seems that neither phone is in working condition. They both turn on and work, but the screens don't light up due to water damage on the motherboard.

**CL**: *WATER DAMAGE?!*

**Me**: Yes ma'am. The liquid exposure indicators on both phones show exposure to water, and there is corrosion around the screen connections on the board.

**CL**: Well there was no water damage when I brought it in! Y'all must have spilled water on it!

**Me**: That's not how corrosion works, ma'am. It takes hours for it to oxidize this badly.

**CL**: WELL Y'ALL BETTER FIX IT! I NEED MY PHONE!

**Me**: Sorry, ma'am, but there's nothing we can do here. You can come pick them up at any time. 

She never showed up. 

Another amusing anecdote also involves liquid damage. I'll keep it short. Frequent customer comes in because her phone isn't turning on. Open it up to find *standing water* still inside the phone! Didn't tell us that. Clean it up, replace battery, all good. She insisted ""it's never been anywhere near water,"" but whatever. A few weeks later, she comes back it because it's not turning on again. I explain that we can't warranty the battery because of water damage to the phone, and they were okay with it. Open it up to find *standing water* still inside the phone! Wait what? Clean it up, replace battery, all good. 

She comes in to get it, and I tell her about the water in the phone. I kid you not, this poor girl says ""Y'all were supposed to have taken care of that last time!"" Naw, precious, water don't work that way. We tell her this was fresh water, and she again says ""It's never been anywhere near water.""

First post here so be nice ;)

Anyways, had a user a few weeks ago now - pc is beeping and won’t boot up, fine. Go over to his desk and it’s beeping 5 times, RAM error. 

Opened up the side panel and there’s 4 sticks of DDR2, mega-bling, 4GB RAM in there which as a business we’d never issue so I asked him had any other techs changed anything he said no. 

So, I took the RAM out and installed 16GB and all was fine, PC booted and he’s back working. 

Anyways, fast forward a week or so and he’s boasting to me that his PC at home has had a RAM upgrade since “about a week ago” and it’s been mega fast since, I said “oh cool, what did you put in it” and he said “16GB” then his face dropped when he realised what he had said and he quickly said that he had to go and start working again....

He replaced the damn RAM from his work machine in his personal machine and swapped in his RAM from home to his work PC like I wouldn’t notice 2 gold RAM sticks inside...

Smh, anyone else had internal components stolen by users? And/or had users try to cover it ?

TL;DR: User stole RAM from his work PC and swapped it with his personal PC’s RAM which was incompatible then he slipped up a week later and told me he did it.",talesfromtechsupport,763,1560497555

I made an all-staff announcement so people knew to get out of the $WebApp. When I restart the server, the electricity in their suite goes out. Luckily, their critical networking and server infrastructure are on battery backups and electricity comes back on in less than a minute. As I'm heading out of the server room, almost every user said things such as:  

&amp;#x200B;

""I thought you were just restarting the server!""

""Wow, I didn't know the server ran THAT!""

""Does IT handle electrical issues too?""  

&amp;#x200B;

Nonetheless, all of these were said in jest (or at least I badly hope so).",talesfromtechsupport,845,1560300050
Budsygus,Steve's Going to Heaven,"This isn't my story, but a former roommate's. We'll call him Steve.

Steve was a super nice guy, and also a tech genius. One night in college our whole apartment is asleep when someone's phone rings at like 3am. We all hear it, but try to ignore it. Then we hear Steve moving around and getting dressed. Everyone is up (no idea why we were all woken up by this, but we were), so I holler to the guy who shares a room with Steve ""Mark, what's going on?""

Mark tells us basically this: A girl in our apartment complex had her computer crash and she hadn't saved her final paper that was due in like 6 hours, so she wanted Steve to come fix it and hopefully save her paper. At 3am.

To my knowledge this girl had never spoken to Steve before in her life. I have no idea how she knew he was a tech genius and no idea how she got his number, but Steve, the freaking amazing dude he was, gets up and marches over there without a second thought.

About 30 minutes later he comes back. We ask him (because we're all still awake for some reason) ""What happened?""

Literally he turned it off and on again. The paper had auto-saved, she was just too scared to do anything for fear of losing it. Steve doesn't complain, he doesn't grumble, he just climbs into bed and says ""I'm just glad she didn't lose any data.""

After that Mark starts shouting ""Guys! Guys! Grab onto Steve's legs! He's getting sucked straight up into heaven and we can hitch a ride!""

Seriously, Steve was one of the nicest, most selfless guys I ever met. He battled cancer for years before I met him, and it finally took his life a few years after this happened, but I'll always remember him because of stuff like this he did for others without a second thought.",talesfromtechsupport,2142,1560271249
BTallack,What do you mean I can’t listen to internet radio?,"About three years ago I was working for an MSP.  One of our biggest clients was a 50+ employee office in the county that had a 10/2 wireless internet connection for the entire office. At the time that was the absolute best they could get.

Their most common complaint not surprisingly was that their internet was slow. Fortunately for us they were running Meraki gear so we were able to quickly find where the issues were. 

It turns out that about a dozen people in the office were listening to internet radio. The worst part is that it wasn’t even something like Spotify or stations in other parts of the world.  They were legitimately using the internet to listen to a local FM station.

I was tasked with troubleshooting their ‘connection issues’ and preparing a report.  In this report I cited that it’s a huge waste of very limited resources to be streaming internet radio and recommended they ask their staff to avoid streaming content off the internet. They very begrudgingly accepted my recommendation but this upset a lot of their staff.

About a week later I get an urgent call that their connection has slowed to a crawl.  I log onto the Meraki and see that there’s a single video stream using up 90% of their total bandwidth.  The Vice President of the company was streaming a baseball game.

Now my mistake was in letting my main contact at the company know this. Less than a week later they dropped us.  I guess the VP didn’t appreciate being singled out for wasting bandwidth. (Or wasn’t supposed to be watching baseball on company time.)",talesfromtechsupport,1303,1560238494
persondude27,"""I didn't know what to click, so I turned it off.""","[ndscable's story here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/byem1e/what_exactly_did_you_think_shutting_down_meant/eqh4j3d/) reminded me of a TFTS I had recently.

I was working at a medical devices company. Our equipment collected ECG data for clinical drug trials, so each data set ended up being pretty expensive ($5,000 - $10,000 per day) due to the cost of experimental drug, manpower, and legal and medical hoops of getting an untested drug into real humans.

I got assigned to a case where a site was reporting we had misplaced roughly a month of data - something on the order of a quarter million dollar and thousands of man-hours invested, vanished without a trace. The level 1 tech had tried all the obvious things, so it fell to me to figure out where the data went.

First, we knew the data (ECGs on human subjects) existed, because the site had paper copies of the ECG. Unfortunately, we needed the machine data because it had much higher resolution. But the electronic copy simply didn't exist - not on their system, not on our server. We checked server logs, system logs, databases, everything. We simply never received a copy of it. It had disappeared.

After almost an hour of trying to help this 60+ year old research nurse figure out what was going on, I finally said, ""OK - just go through a whole procedure. Start at the beginning, actually do the whole thing, while I watch your computer on TeamViewer.""

Everything was going normally - in fact, the quality was nearly perfect! She printed out a paper copy, and then right before she should've clicked ""Save &amp; Submit""... the screen went black. 

Over the phone, I asked her:

&gt; Me: ""What just happened?""

&gt; Nurse: ""Oh, I turned off the computer.""

&gt; Me: ""What! Wait, why?! And how?!""

&gt; Nurse: ""Oh, if I push the X, it says, 'Do you want to save this report or discard it?'. It won't let me close the program until I click something, and I don't know what to push, so I turn the computer off.""

&gt; Me: ""Wait, how do you turn the computer off?""

&gt; Nurse: ""I press and hold the little light-up button on the top right of the keyboard.""

I'd figured it out. The reason the data was missing was because it was never saved - the nurse would cut power on the laptop rather than answer the question of ""do you want to save this very important, very time-consuming report you just generated?""

Bonus: it came up that she didn't know how to type capital letters. ""Someone once told me to press the shift-key and then the letter, but it never works."" I asked her to press the shift key AND the letter at the same time, and she literally screamed in joy when a capital 'C' appeared on her screen.

The client sent me a bottle of scotch after this conversation.",talesfromtechsupport,2386,1560103063
lux_sentou,What exactly did you think shutting down meant?,"So I got this call a few months back, and to this day it remains one of my favorite stories. It's also one that makes me heavily question the company's priorities when it comes to staffing.

It's about two in the afternoon and a call rolls in. I answer with the always-beloved canned greeting, and on the other end of the phone is a nice sounding lady. We exchange pleasantries while I collect info for her ticket; she doesn't sound young, but also not particularly old... that said, I'd say she was at the very least young enough to *know better.*

So anyway, she's having some problem or another, truth be told I don't remember what. I do remember it was one of those bog-standard problems you solve a dozen times a day, nothing serious. But midway through some of my starting questions, she chimes in:

""Yeah, so I talked to my manager before I called in, and he says people who have this problem have been fixing it by shutting down the computer. So I did that, and now the screen is all dark, and I can't do anything. What happened?""

'I'm sorry, what?' is what I did NOT reply, though I definitely thought it. What I actually did was painfully choke down the chuckle involuntarily rising in my throat, and ask if she powered the computer back on after she shut it down.

""What do you mean turn it on? I never have to do that!""

Oh boy...

So, I direct her to the big round button on her desktop, and tell her to go ahead and push it, which she does.

""Okay, so i did that, and then all these lights came on and it started making whirring noises, so I pushed it again and it stopped.""

Oh boy...

After that, things wrapped up without much issue. She turns the computer back on, whatever problem she had was, in fact, solved by that reboot. So, wins all around. She's ecstatic, thanks me for being a genius, and hangs up.

Ultimately nothing special, and she was very nice and easy to work with. Hell, I'd rather my calls be more of those and less of the type I typically get. But to this day, I'm just baffled as to what the company was thinking giving some of these people computers and access to sensitive data. There's ""computer illiteracy,"" and then theres not knowing to turn it on.

Also, looking at her job title I'm positive she makes way more than me, and that made me existentially depressed for a few minutes.

t_a_6847646847646476,"If your USB cable isn't going all the way in, common sense would say there's probably something inside the port that's preventing it from doing so.","I don't work in tech support or phone repair, but I do work in retail and my job deals with phone stuff. No, I don't work for a carrier or phone store (thank god) but I get enough shit here to allow for a few stories.

This actually just took place a few minutes ago. A kid walked up to me and asked if I could fix Huawei phones or knew a place that does so. I said I couldn't, then asked him what was wrong with the phone to give him some advice. He pulled a Huawei P20 out of his pocket and told me his USB port was loose. I knew the most common cause of a seemingly loose USB port on a phone is crud accumulating inside, so I asked him the following question:

&gt; Does it seem like your cable can't go all the way in?

He immediately answered positively so I knew that was definitely his issue. I told him to get a toothpick and when he came back with one, I spent the next 5 minutes showing him how to scrape the crud out of the port. After we were done, he plugged the cable in to check and it did what he expected it to do. He thanked me for teaching him what to do if something like this happened, tried to pay me and left after I refused because come on, this is something you shouldn't pay anyone to do for you.

I'm sure that if I didn't ask him what his issue was and help him fix it on the spot, he would have wasted money just to get crud scraped out of his USB port because a shop would likely charge him labour.",talesfromtechsupport,1208,1559935896
DrHugh,I bet you reading this already know the solution,"I got an alert at 2:14 AM on my phone. Because I'm the only after-hours support for my group on helpline stuff, if the priority is High or Critical then I get notified.

I woke up and had to go to the toilet. Got dressed. Got my computer started. Got logged in, got in to VPN, got in to the ticket tracking software. It is now about 2:35 AM.

I find the ticket, but it is a little vague -- client had problems approving a document, as if the password we stored was wrong, and this had to be approved urgently. We don't store passwords for this; we use a ""single sign-on"" approach that lets the client use the same username and password that they use to login to their work computer. In addition, the client only provided the task ID, not the document ID, but I can find one with the other once I login.

I also pull up our work chat software to see if the user is online. She is, but away. I message her anyway.

*(Now, if you were in this situation -- client says they can't do X, and are having password problems -- what would you be most likely to suggest? Please write your answer down, but do not show it to anyone just yet.)*

Investigation reveals that the document was approved at 2:16 AM by the client. Apparently, the problem didn't occur after the wake-me-up-at-2:14-AM ticket was submitted. I change the status to Pending Client and write up my findings, and start up the mail software when I see the client is back active.

She said she'd been having password problems, so she rebooted. *(Was this your answer? Well done!)* Then everything worked fine. She submitted the ticket before rebooting, of course.

NotYourNanny,"When the hardware hates you, personally and individually.","Hapless Hank is a one man IT department for a retail store chain. He handles sixteen stores in multiple states, which keeps him busy, but not overly so. He knows the network inside and out, because he built it from scratch. And in the course of 20 years, he's seen every possible thing that can go wrong with computers, except for the new tricks that (l)users keep inventing. Or so he thought.


As is usual in retail, every store has more cash registers than they need, most of the time. The extra capacity is for those busy times of the year, like Black Friday, and the weeks following between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So when something breaks, the store manager tends to just move the broken part to a different register, and not mention it to Hapless Hank until the day before a big sale on a three day weekend. This was such a week.


One of the cash registers was blue screening a couple of times a day. (Yes, Windows based cash registers. I know. Don't get me started.) Based on two decades of experience with this POS system, it was most likely a corrupted (or just bad) driver, probably for the receipt printer. It happens, and it's an easy fix. Swap out the CPU with the spare, and reinstall Windows, making the troublesome computer the new spare. Takes maybe half an hour.


Except the new CPU won't identify the credit card pad. Not a problem, Hapless Hank has seen this sort of thing before. The first generation USB cable for the credit card pads was incompatible with certain USB chipsets that the manufacturer was known to use. Toss the old CPU back in (since it mostly worked), and take the new one back to the shop to do some testing.


And everything works perfectly. OK, that really does look like the cable issue. A brief, and largely useless, call to the help(less) desk confirms the likelihood. So Hapless Hank takes the new CPU, and a new USB cable, and a new credit card pad, just in case, back to the store. Following Troubleshooting 101, he plugs in just the pad, using the new cable, and everything looks good. Adds in the other POS devices, one at a time, and everything looks good. Pulls and replaces out the old credit card cable, and notices it's not the first generation cable, but OK, maybe mice chewed on it, whatever. Plugs everyting back in, boots it up, and Windows can't identify the receipt printer.


Well, receipt printers do go bad, and all the cables have been disturbed, and coincidences do happen. Sure they do. Hapless Hank swaps the receipt printer with another register, which is known good. Windows still won't identify it. Bad USB cable? Well, at least that's a standard cable, unlike for the credit card pad. Known good cable from the tool box goes in. Same issue. And the blue screens are getting worse.


At this point, Hapless Hank has narrowed the problem down from a corrupted driver, to a bad cable or a bad receipt printer, to a recent Windows update specific to 64 bit (which the old CPU was not), *or* a corrupted driver on the new software level install disk, *or* a bad USB port, *or* a bad USB chipset on the motherboard, *or* any of several other thing. So, the old CPU goes back in, and the new one goes back to the shop - again - for more testing.


So, to recap the same digital deaths occur on two separate CPUs running different version of the operating system, with two different receipt printers, with two different USB cables, two different credit card pads, and two different proprietary cables on the pads. All of which work perfectly anywhere else.


The CPU goes into a register in the corporate store. And everything works perfectly fine. Zero issues. Stable as a rock. Every single component that does not work correctly has tested good, with multiple examples of each.


OK, now Hapless Hank is getting a little annoyed. He allots a day to do on site testing, and took an entire spare cash register along. And started carefully testing each component, one at a time, before and after a reboot, as it was plugged in. Eventually, he determined that the problems only occurred when the barcode scanner was plugged in. The barcode scanner itself worked fine, of course, but when it was plugged in, *everything* *else* became unstable or nonfunctional. OK, the cables on barcode scanners go bad, too, as do the scanners themselves. Replaced both, plugged in to the front of the CPU, because pulling the cable through the counter is a pain when it's not certain that's the problem. Everything works fine. Swap out the cable, and discover that it's actually pretty easy, because there's an extension cable that is long enough to come out of the top of the counter, so it's not necessary to actually run it through the too-small holes in the cabinet. Fire it all up, and . . . blue screens, and the Windows can't identify the receipt printer (which worked fine without the USB extension *on the barcode scanner*). Really? A bad USB extension? No problem, Hapless Hank is prepared, and has another, known good USB extension, too. It's a pain, but fairly simple, to pull the new extension through the counter using the old one as a pull string.


And the same thing happens. Blue screen, no receipt printer, dogs and cats living together, hellfire raining down from the heavens, and a whole lot of cursing under his breath.


In the end, it turned out it wasn't a *bad* USB extension cable, it was merely the presence of an extension, any extension, on the barcode scanner. And the barcode scanner worked fine throughout; at no point did it act up at all. But as soon as the USB extension was plugged in, either the receipt printer or the credit card pad crapped out, and the blue screens started. And no, it wasn't a power issue - everything but the barcode scanner has its own power supply, and the barcode scanner worked fine. And no, it's not an overload issue on the USB circuit, because the same equipment plugged into the same ports without the extension all works fine. And no, it's not the drivers on the barcode scanner, which has no special drivers - Windows see it as a keyboard, and loads the default keyboard drivers. The best that Hapless Hank could figure, the receipt printer drivers (which are, at best, a little unstable) somehow detected the presence of the USB extension on the barcode scanner, and crashed.


It was a bad week for Hapless Hank, but at least he got to see something new, and his troubleshooting technique got a good workout.",talesfromtechsupport,876,1559861267

S0N_0F_K0RHAL,They Want New Proximity Keys but Refuse to Tell Me Which One,"This is a mini story and mini rant. Perhaps updates to come in the future.


I’m currently in training to replace the sole phone technician on my university campus. One of my responsibilities is replacing proximity keys. Most of these keys are used by the hotel we run on campus. Apparently, it’s the manager’s habit to request new room keys without specifying which one (for example, she’ll say Room 203 but not specify which of the keys for that room needs replacing).


She requested one today, and I sent her a polite email:


“Hi $hotelmanager, I’ll be happy to replace the proximity key for you. First, however, could you let me know which key I need to replace? You can find this information by giving me the first six digits on the back of the key that you still have. Once I have this information, I can replace your key right away.”


The guy training me didn’t like this approach, and walked over to figure out which key was missing. He later returned saying one key is missing and the other is already checked out, so we have no way of knowing which key to replace, and instructed me to pick a key at random.


I did so, and later walked over and dropped off the key saying, “Well, I had to pick a key at random so hopefully this is the right one.”


To which an employee responded, “Oh well, the customer has the other key, so obviously it’s the one he doesn’t have.”


I said “Yeah, so if I replaced his key instead of the missing key, then he’s going to be locked out. There’s a 50% chance that’s going to happen.”


“Oh...”


Fingers crossed I got the right one and someone isn’t going to realize they’re locked out at midnight. Meanwhile, I returned and the guy training me who said the email I sent was wrong, saying “You’re not going to be able to always get your way, and your insistence to do so is bullying. And you can’t refuse to do your job, you can be fired for that.”",talesfromtechsupport,977,1559749125
MLDsmithy,No one knows how to use the shop-vac.,"Another post reminded me of this little gem, figured I'd share in its own post. Now, I have to preface some things for folks who aren't familiar with industrial hardware. This stuff will be important.

* Many industrial machines have control cabinets; exactly what it sounds like, large metal boxes of varying size that hold all the electrical and control hardware for the machine. Breakers, relays, wiring terminals, and often computers.
* Many cabinets don't have handles; instead they have a little recessed slot that you'd turn with a quarter or something to actually open it. They still open easily, but it's to keep them closed from random passerby with the timmy-grippy.
* Most machines have some form of Big Red OShit Button emergency stop. These are wired to safety relays in the cabinet, which bypass the whole system and bring everything to a screeching halt if pressed. These things are red, to differentiate them from the other hardware.  


Some time ago, I...uh...worked on (and by that I mean looked at and left) a control cabinet for a very large machine that cut wood boards. The service contract for said machine, including the wee little Dell inside the cabinet, clearly specified the responsibilities of the operating company to clean and maintain it.  


One summer day, we get a (desperate) call that the machine no longer works, and that one of the operators smelled smoke. Myself and another tech get on site, roll up to this sweet piece of hardware, and try to take a look inside the cabinet. Our first clue that something was amiss was we couldn't open it. Normally you can turn the little slot key with a quarter, or your car key, but this thing wouldn't budge. I eventually had to go find a site mechanic with one of the prybar-sized flatheads just to be able to turn the damn thing.  


I get the door open, and I'm greeted by sawdust. Not a layer of dust, mind you, but visually a control cabinet filled with nothing but sawdust. It looked like the company had been attempting to create IKEA-style pressed sawdust furniture using the box as a mold. A small patch of the sawdust was black, and still smoldering. At this point, neither myself nor my partner could stop laughing. We took a couple pictures, then started digging through the smoldering stuff to get that cleared out. The black patch was bigger on the inside, and surrounded two red (ish), burnt, vaguely relay-shaped husks of plastic.   


Our laughter continued as I put a padlock on the power switch for the machine, told the supervisor I'll inform our engineers, and left.  


TL:DR: company never cleans a machine that produces copious amounts of sawdust. Dust accumulates, catches fire inside a cabinet. Only reason machine didn't burn to the ground is that there was so much sawdust, there wasn't room for air.",talesfromtechsupport,1032,1559689702

Wrangling all the vendors and educating the users, coming up with the plans and formalizing all the documentation for the C-levels. But I know first hand why it's so important. All the little annoyances and frustrations- they're all worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

I hadn't been in my position for very long- only about 6 months or so. My $boss and $coworker-not-appearing-in-this-story were also new. We'd all been hired at the same time and tasked with managing our central database and its related hardware. The system, while not in bad shape, wasn't exactly in the best of shape either. Crucially, (and as we would come to later regret) it needed firmware updates and a few other housekeeping things done.

&amp;#x200B;

I was waiting to finish my last task of the night: import a file into the database when it came in, then notify my coworker in another department. She would then do....something...with that data and then we could both go home. The system had a little console utility that let us view the console messages real-time from the comfort of our desks. I normally kept it up all day just to keep an eye on things.

&amp;#x200B;

That night the file was later than usual. So I sat at my desk, busying myself with something or other while the console utility scrolled serenely on my second monitor. I'd gotten used to its messages; users disconnecting, backup logs being created, background processes starting and finishing. But then something caught my eye- an unfamiliar message. I turned my full attention to the console and read:

&amp;#x200B;

HARDWARE FAILURE DETECTED

&amp;#x200B;

Oh. Well. That's...probably not good. But obviously the server was still alive since the console utility was still scrolling messages. And it wasn't a hard drive failure since that displayed the somewhat more helpful ""Hard drive failure detected"". I poked what I could and couldn't figure out what was wrong. So I phoned my boss.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;$boss: ....Ok. Well I'll take a look. I'll call you back.

Meanwhile, the file we were waiting for had come in but I wasn't comfortable importing it with the hardware error still scrolling across my console. I told my coworker what was going on and she decided to go home. We could deal with the file in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

$Boss called me back and said he couldn't figure out the source of the error, either. Luckily he lived nearby and 5 minutes later he walked in the door.

&amp;#x200B;

Ah, the benefits of being an hourly employee, I thought to myself as I drove home. Consequently, the remainder of this story was told to me by $boss the following morning.

&amp;#x200B;

He called our hardware vendor and they determined that one of our drive controllers had failed. Not great, but not terrible either. The secondary controller had picked up when the primary failed, just as intended. But then everything went to shit. All our hard drives suddenly dropped- the secondary controller had just failed. The vendor realized that our controllers were on an old firmware version, one that had a serious bug. The controllers were default programmed to undergo a self-test every so often. Normally this wouldn't be a problem since the secondary controller would take over until the primary rebooted itself. Only, because of the bug, the controller never came back up from the self-test. So the primary self-tested and died, and then the secondary self-tested and died. Great.

&amp;#x200B;

They managed to get one of the controllers back up in the wee hours of the morning, but the damage to the database had been done. Apparently it hadn't liked all of its drives disappearing and had suffered unrecoverable corruption. Our CIO had, by that time, also come into the office and he made the decision to declare a Disaster Recovery Event.

&amp;#x200B;

We enacted our DR plan and most of the work to switch over to our DR system was done by the time I got in the next morning. We told our users what had happened and that yes, the DR system was noticeably slower than our production system; please don't call us about it. That mostly worked. Mostly.

&amp;#x200B;

Not long after I got in $boss and CIO went home to get some well deserved rest and I was left to deal with some minor quirks of the DR system, mostly printer related (Don't we all love printers?). But the transition was largely seamless for our users, which is the true goal of any fail-over event. We were on the DR system for about a week while our failed controllers were replaced. And then, well, that was it. We switched back to our production system with no further issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty anti-climactic, I know. But isn't that a good thing with disaster events? We had a plan, we followed it, and no data was lost. And everyone lived happily ever after. Well, except for that one department: no matter which printer they printed to while we were on the DR system, the document always printed on the manager's printer. I never did figure that one out.",talesfromtechsupport,906,1559448995
Crossbar87,Oh My laptop is in my car boot!,"I encountered this a week or so ago with the head of HR / Operations in my office.

projecktzero,Production Outages only... yeah right.,"Many many years ago, I used to have an IT job at a manufacturing plant that ran 24/7. Unfortunately, the IT dept didn't have 24/7 staff coverage, so one person each week was on call during the nights and weekends. We had to carry a pager. It was supposed to be for **production outages** only. 

One weekend, I was busy doing yard work and the pager goes off. I call the user and he starts telling me about a printer that doesn't work. I ask if he can use another one on the network, and he starts asking me if I can send someone in to fix it. I then ask him how is this printer preventing production. He says ""you aren't going to help me, are you?"" I tell him no and hang up. I made a note of the printer and had the helpdesk fix it the following Monday. 

My boss had a talk with the user's supervisor the following Monday about what constitutes a **production outage** and when to call the pager.

Eventually, years later the brain dead upper management approved to have 24/7 helpdesk coverage and we no longer had to carry the pager.",talesfromtechsupport,996,1559156006
djwrek,That's not what I asked you to do,"This happened last week. The company that I work for has our Help Desk team occasionally provide support to third-party companies which have their own techs that install and support our software suite. This one company in particular has a tech who always runs in to problems. I'm going to call him $PIMA.

&gt; $Me: ""Hello, Help Desk speaking how may I help you?""
&gt; $PIMA: ""I'm getting an error about a file missing when I start your software""
&gt; $Me: ""OK, Can you send me a screenshot of the error.""

I look at the screenshot, it's an error about a config file missing. This guy is notorious for messing with files outside of the application that shouldn't be touched. I grab a default config file off the network and send it to him.

&gt; $Me: ""I've sent you a file that you need to place in the application install directory. Let me know if this solves your problem.""

Five minutes later...

&gt; $PIMA: ""Yeah it didn't work. The missing file error is gone but the application won't start""
&gt; $Me: ""OK, I'm going to need to remote in to your computer.""
&gt; $PIMA: ""Why? I did what you said and it didn't work.""
&gt; $Me: ""I just need to check *something else*.""

I gain access to the computer and go to the application install directory and look at the config file. It has size of 0 KB. I think to myself ""Please tell me he didn't just try to create an empty file hoping it would magically work?""

&gt; $Me: ""Can you download the file I sent you earlier to the desktop?""
&gt; $PIMA: ""Sure.""

I look at the file it's the correct size. I replace the config file in the install directory with it and launch the application. It starts without any issues.

&gt; $Me: ""Did you try to create the file yourself?""
$PIMA: deafening silence

TheLightningCount1,Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies.,"Another round of lying users getting put in their place. 

I have been working from home on the weekends as I will soon be switched over to salary so I am milking the hell out of all of the overtime I can get. 

First call on Saturday. 

&gt; $User - Hello I need assistance resetting my PW. 

&gt; $Me - Ok. I have reset your password to be *generic password* and it will force you to change it on login. 

&gt; $User - Can you reset it to be *old password?*

&gt; $Me - Unfortunately no, we are no longer able to set previously used passwords int he system. People had been abusing that in the past and there was a security event because of it. (Total pack of lies)

&gt; $User - Can you make an exception for me this one time?

&gt; $Me - Sorry there is a bit of confusion. I would if I had the permissions to do that, but the system will block me from using a previously used password. Even if it did work, the system would catch it and disable your password almost immediately. 

&gt; $User - You don't understand. Unless I can set it to that SAME password, then I will lose this loan.  

&gt; $Me - How... Umm. Normally I would never ask this, but... How?

&gt; $User - Well my assistant and I have the same password...

&gt; $Me - Are you and your assistant sharing accounts?

&gt; $User - No. 

&gt; $Me - I am sorry but I will be unable to assist any further on this. I have reset your password to be *Generic password* and it will force you to change it on next login. Here is my direct supervisor's email if you wish to escalate this. 

I pulled the call and filed a ticket on it. The VP over security replied within an hour and let me know he spoke with the user and informed him of the severity of sharing accounts. The user did send an email to my boss, but my boss just told me ""good job.""

Second instance. 

&gt; $Me - Thanks fo

&gt; $User - You have to help me!!

&gt; $Me - Whoa... sorry your urgency almost sounded like you were being attacked. (Said as a joke)

&gt; $User - *laughs* Thanks. I'm trying to extract these files sent to me by my borrower and they are giving me errors in Adobe. 

&gt; $Me - OK. Lets take a look. Go here, click this, now use this code. Ok we are connected. 

Took 20 seconds to see the issue. 

&gt; $Me - Ok I see the issue. 

&gt; $User - What is it?

&gt; $Me - These files are zero KB. The borrower must have incorrectly sent you the wrong thing. They will need to send them again. 

&gt; $User - I do not think they did. 

&gt; $Me - Well I can check the exchange side and see. One moment. OK it looks like the total size of that email is only 200kbish. Most of that is your signature. The email was not malformed and it looks like there is no data corruption. The user must have sent the wrong thing. You will need to reach out to them again and have them re-submit it. 

&gt; $User - I already did. It made them mad. They said if we can not get these working, then they will go with another company. 

At that moment the borrower sent in another email that started with. ""Oops I accidentally sent you incorrect files. Here are the correct files."" 

I clicked the email and said nothing. 

&gt; $User - *sigh* Thanks. 

Memorial day. Cell phone rings from an unknown number.

&gt; $Me - Umm. You hear those big bangs in the background? Im at the range. More than 4000 feet from any computer. 

&gt; $User - Well you have your phone right? I need my password reset. Im trying to close this loan and I am at the bank right now. If we can not get it reset we will lose this loan. 

&gt; $Me - No you won't.

&gt; $Karen - Excuse me? Your team is here to support us. Why are you not in the office today manning the phones?

&gt; $Me - Its a company holiday. Do not call my personal cell phone again. Do not give out my personal cell phone to anyone else. I pay for this phone and it will not be used for company purposes. 

&gt; $Karen - I will call $CIO then.

&gt; $CIO - Who is this?

&gt; $Karen - $Karen. 

&gt; $CIO - Care to explain why $Me's personal cell phone has been blowing up for work related purposes on a company holiday?

&gt; $Karen - (Says something about losing a 4m loan and loan officer being at bank. $CIO had phone so did not hear this.)

&gt; $CIO - You can lie to the support team all you want but lying to me will not help you. Its memorial day and banks are closed. This is something that can wait till tomorrow. Do not give out $Me's cell phone to anyone else ever again. Do not call anyone's personal cell phone ever again.

fleurgold,Things that should not be found in printers,"This story is inspired by /u/inkwhale's printer story, which can be [found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/btjnv0/wow_that_wire_isnt_supposed_to_be_there)

I (semi-reluctantly) provide tech support for my family. I justify it by gifting it to them for every Christmas, with a 'one meal must be provided per visit' clause. This story is about of on my sisters, and a printer she received from an old roommate.

About a year and a half ago, my sister called me up, asking if I could fix this printer her roommate gave to her. Her roommate claimed it has never functioned since the day she bought it, and it was far past the return date. 

I ask what happens when it tries to print. ""Well, it just makes this grinding noise and then a red light blinks."" I ask dear sister to see if there are any error codes on the display. ""What display?"" 

Now, don't get me wrong. I do love my sister. And she's smart! She graduated with a major in biology, with honours, from a prestigious university. But, alas, when it comes to anything technological, she's far worse than our grandmother to work with. 

So, I pack up my gear, and catch the next bus. By the time I arrive at her apartment, she's already prepping the mandatory meal. I get directed to her bedroom where the grinding, sad HP printer is sitting in the corner of her room on the floor. 

I start troubleshooting, checking the error codes, checking for jammed paper. Get a tiny piece of paper out from underneath the sensor that checks for jams, and that temporarily clears the error. But the printer is still making that sound, and the error has returned. I check again for more jammed paper, but there is not a single scrap of paper in this printer. 

I start gently taking off a couple parts to see if I can find the source of this supposed jam. I eventually have to unscrew and lift up the scanning plate. And through this little hole, I see something that is definitely not paper, but also definitely not part of the printer. 

Fear of further taking the printer apart leads to the decision to try and pull this mystery object out through the hole using tweezers. So sister grabs me a pair of tweezers, and sure enough within 30 seconds, out pops a hair elastic. 

Slightly dumbfounded, I ponder how it could have gotten in there while screwing the printer back together. 

Sure enough, the error code clears, and the printer is on it's merry way printing test pages in a matter of minutes.

With the printer assembled, I take a look at how's it built and gather some information from the roommate. 

It turns out, she had only used the printer for a couple scans before she tried to print something. Of course, the paper feed is on the back of the printer, and the scan lid lifts up at the front of the printer, allowing anything and everything sitting on top of the printer to slide right on down into the printer. 

I gave my sister a stern warning not to ever put anything on top of her shiny, new, fixed printer, ate my free home cooked meal, and went on my way back home. 

A few months later, I get yet another call from my sister. The printer is saying it's jammed again. I ask if she's checked for anything odd in the paper feed tray. She swears that she does not see anything, and that she's never, ever, ever put anything on top of the printer like I told her. 

So once more, I grab my gear and head out. I pull the printer forward on her desk, and turn it around so I can get a better view into the paper tray. 

""Okay then, sis, what's this?"" I ask her as I hold up a single black hair elastic.",talesfromtechsupport,935,1558979697

I see a jumble of wires rather than a paper jam and start poking at them and my gut tells me they aren't supposed to be there cause the texture is weird and the color is different than the other visible wires. So I just start pulling them out. My jaw drops as I pull out a pair of Beats Earbuds. They're like $60 earbuds and I can't figure out why they were inside the printer. Turns out a coworker set them on the paper tray and someone started to print something and they got sucked in.

CaffeinatedPanic,Help! My database is gone!,"I kind of have a weird position. Our company has a dedicated I.T. department but legal wanted their own I.T. guy so they don't have to wait their turn for most issues. So they hired me. Luckily the I.T. department has granted me some autonomy in the form of Admin privileges once they ascertained I was competent enough not to make things harder for them. 

I kinda of lucked out in this gig since most of my co-workers are pretty computer savvy. I'm usually only called for the larger problems which I have no problem with. Of course not every work place is perfect. We do have some support staff members that are...well...less informed than you'd like. 

I got a call from one of our support staff members in a complete panic. Her database was completely wiped out. This was concerning for multiple reasons. One...our database is backed up to the cloud...and two she shouldn't have access to delete the database. In fact her job doesn't even have her accessing the database. That being said, my predecessor wasn't the most competent and I am still discovering his landmine type messes. While in a tail spin of immediate panic, I go to our database. All is well. 

I decide it is time to go to this particular employee and see what exactly she was on about thinking it was relatively simple. At this point I was just happy that the database was intact so really anything that the employee had done was nothing compared to having to restore the entire database.

At their desk, I ask them to show me what the issue was. They told me that they normally generate these word documents which get sent to the client by mail. After they send them they save them...right to the recycle bin...by deleting them...I think I had to do a full reboot in my head. This employee would complete their work and print it out. Then to ""Save space"" delete the document...because it went to the god damn recycling bin. They proceeded to show me the recycling bin which had over 100 documents in it. They proceeded to tell me this happened now and again where they'd lose everything once in a while. They said it was normally after I.T. worked on their computer...and low key blamed I.T. for not knowing what they were doing. 

I had to explain that the recycle bin is literally there to delete items you no longer want and it is not a database or a way to save items you want to keep. I had to call I.T. and explain the situation. After they were done laughing...which I mean yeah... they said they'd have to restore a previous version. 

After a previous version was restored with their recycle bin ""restored"" I had to move everything into a folder and had to tell them under no circumstances were they to delete anything or put anything in a recycle bin. I told them in no uncertain terms that it was not a database. They were reticent but I did take the recycling bin off their desktop. Unclear if I got through to them or if they are just saving new items to the folder only because I removed the recycle bin.",talesfromtechsupport,734,1558918559

""Hey I am trying to use my laptop and the VPN keeps saying it cannot connect"" now my first response is to ask where they currently are, ""oh I'm at the park"" ""...do you have internet connection"" ""well no..."" ""Yeah you need internet to be able to connect to the VPN"" and that was the end of the call. And I'm just sat there wondering what magic people expect of the VPN to be able to connect without any connection at all. Crazy.",talesfromtechsupport,1114,1558877469
Oricu,"""I know the building is on fire, but I need to make a server backup FIRST!""","This one is from way back in the day (in this case, 'the day' is 2004).

&amp;#x200B;

Got a call from a site and the lady just calmly asked how to do a backup. On the old system she had, we recommended pretty frequent, like at least twice per day, backups because the software was this jankey old unix/xenix monstrosity that, if it crashed or locked up with a record open, it'd corrupt the entire database and they'd have to restore from the last backup.

&amp;#x200B;

That could mean an entire day's worth of rekeying from paper trails, so most of our clinics would back up once around noon, then again at close.

&amp;#x200B;

So, not abnormal to get that sort of call.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was walking her through the steps to do a tape backup on these old systems, I become sort of aware of what sounds like a man yelling in the background but he's too far from where she is and I can't really hear him.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I start to hear something that sounds like a ""FSSSSSSSHHHHHHH"" sort of sound which isn't super abnormal, a lot of the vet clinics had their server in weird places, including around grooming or dental areas so you'd sometimes hear equipment that made sounds like that, and she says, ""Oh no! The backup *has* to finish now! What if the water damages the server?!""

&amp;#x200B;

The...water? *What?!* I ask her what's going on and before she can answer the guy who was yelling came closer and I very clearly heard, ""Ma'am, the building is on fire. ***You need to leave NOW!***""

&amp;#x200B;

""NO! I have to get this backup done first or we'll lose the data from this morning!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Ma'am, again, *the building is. on. fire.* You need to leave!""

&amp;#x200B;

""It'll just be another fifteen minutes!""

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I figure the noise I heard was the overhead sprinklers coming on and also, *definitely* heard someone say, twice, that the building was on fire.

&amp;#x200B;

""Uh, $Name, I think you should really listen to the guy from the fire department, if the building is on fire you need to get out. There's a backup off site from last night, it's not worth getting injured to avoid having to rekey three hours worth of data.""

&amp;#x200B;

""What if the server gets wet!? I have to take the server!!""

&amp;#x200B;

""The clinic's insurance should cover the cost of replacing it, and you can restore the off site backup to the new server if it comes to that, *please leave the building as it is on fire*.""

&amp;#x200B;

""If I stop the backup now and take the server, will it hurt anything?""

&amp;#x200B;

""...probably not, but again, you really should just get out. We can deal with any issues with the database after the building is no longer on fire.""

&amp;#x200B;

Whole time the increasingly frustrated fire department guy is like, **""JUST GET OUT OF THE BUILDING!""**

&amp;#x200B;

And she snaps at him, ""The fire isn't even on this floor yet, it's on the second floor! Why are you in such a hurry?!""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So she keeps arguing between me and the firefighter and is being told from two sides now to just either take the server if she really wants to and get out or just get out before they forcibly drag her out because at this point the fire is on her floor, just in the ceiling, which is a pretty dangerous situation.

&amp;#x200B;

She elected to unhook the server, cover it with her coat so it wouldn't get wet, and leave with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't get the call to hook it all back up, but they got everyone out, got the fire under control, and there was only some minor smoke and water damage to the clinic from the parts lower than the ceiling. The ceiling and second floor had to be gutted and rebuilt though.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I...kind of admire her willingness to do her job and be that concerned about the server and the backup but, y'know, *building on fire*, you should probably just leave when that happens.",talesfromtechsupport,2373,1558816733
josephlucas,Client doesn’t bother telling me about the monsoon,"So, this happened yesterday.  I was at a client, a small non-profit. I was upgrading five older laptops with SSDs as scheduled since the primary staff doesn’t work Fridays. The only other person in the office walked in and asked if I turned the internet off. I said “No, let me take a look.” I walked to her desk and found the network adapter said it was unplugged. Checked the Ethernet cable, it was fine, so I went to the wiring closet. When I opened the door and stuck my head in I felt a splash of water. There was water dripping from the ceiling. It was dripping directly onto the patch panel, network switches, router, and modems. One switch was completely dead, but the rest of the equipment was still up and running. Then, the office worker told me that there had been water pouring out of that closet and down the walls the day before during a storm. Not just a trickle, but a steady flow. So, I removed all the equipment and told them they needed to fix the leak before I could get them back up and running. I have no idea why they didn’t think to call us about the water pouring over their network equipment, or even tell me about it when I first came in. I have no idea how the equipment was still working as it was obviously wet when I looked at it. I guess they thought since it was still working it didn’t matter.",talesfromtechsupport,604,1558791604

PangPingpong,Please stop using the computer while it is on fire.,"Back in times when the tape backup was king, I configured a 2-3 computer network for a smaller business.  They couldn't afford a dedicated server system at their size, so all systems would be used as workstations for the point of sale software that I both coded and supported, with one being the primary data server.  The server also had a front mounted tape backup that they knew was set to run using a manually rotated set of tapes at 3 AM every day, and a test run was made after the software was installed to be sure everything was working OK.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A year or so later I receive a reasonably worried phone call;

&amp;#x200B;

Cust: ""Hello, our server is acting really strangely.  It keeps freezing up and the screen is going kind of weird.""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Oh, that's not good.""

&amp;#x200B;

Cust: ""There's also smoke coming out the side of the case.  What should we do?""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""TURN IF OFF, RIGHT NOW!""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It turned out that they were continuing to try and use the system while one of the hard drives was on fire.  It burned enough to toast the motherboard, video card, and all of the other drives in the system, but that's OK because they have nightly tape backups, right?  Right?

&amp;#x200B;

New server gets in, last tape goes in to do a restore and...nothing there.  The tape is totally empty.  I check each of the other tapes, and each one comes up blank, one after the other, until I finally find one with something on it - the initial test backup.  After talking with the customer for a while the reason becomes clear.  Each night as they close the shop, they turn all of the computers off.  Including the server that is set to run their backup at 3 AM.  They expected the tape backup, which was mounted on a panel in the server, to run and back up the files on that server's drives when everything was powered off.

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately we had a copy of their data locally that they had given to us for debugging purposes within the past month or two, so they didn't lose everything.

sheCurmudgeon,The crane is not working.,"Customer calls at 3:00 am (getting me out of bed) and tells me that their automated crane hasn’t moved in hours and asks me to check it out.  I ask the standard questions like if the crane has any errors or if they had any issues prior to the crane stopping.  The customer says “no”.  It is important to note that there is a customer facing GUI which they use to monitor the cranes and it shows them things like when the crane is loaded/unloaded, its status, etc.  

At this point I remote in and have a look at the log files thinking maybe communication was lost, but everything looks normal.  I see there are assignments queued up for the crane, but they are not being sent.  At this point I think there is some sort of application issue and dig deeper into the logs and don’t find any.  The customers staff are pestering me for the status every few minutes.  By this point I am beginning to panic.  I still can’t see anything wrong so I dig deeper and start parsing the messages to the cranes.  I look at the status bit which is 0, indicating that the crane was TURNED OFF!  I asked the customer to click on the crane in the interface and tell me what it’s status is, to which they replied: “it’s off”.  I then ask them to turn it on.  They do so, and the crane immediate jumps into action.

Tl;dr:  got called at 3:00 am so that I could tell the customer that they must turn on the equipment for it to work.",talesfromtechsupport,1237,1558712723

Selben,Security Test,"**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**

&amp;nbsp;

**$Selben:** Me! “Technical team lead” previously Tier II helldesk helpdesk technician for a mid-sized company, very skeleton-crew helpdesk 10 of us total for 24 hour coverage (not including supervisors) to support 2500+ company-wide.

**$Tex:** The new IT Director, spurs, cowboy hat the mustache… Yep the real deal.

&amp;nbsp;

Bleary eyed $Selben took another sip of his coffee, the nectar of the gods, as he looked through his queue. A substantial number tickets had been escalated to him with questionable note. It was fairly obvious that either someone was trying to gain access to their network by posing as employees, most of the tickets made it clear the users did not know their security questions and the helpdesk techs had offered their best efforts but refused to comply with just resetting, so the tickets were escalated to $Selben for review. The other option which was most likely was the security team had decided to launch a test, $Selben knew it was better to not notify the helpdesk techs of this as it could make them respond out of the norm. He attempted to reach out to each of the users, getting no response he flagged several as possibly malicious intent and sent the information up to the security team, per their previously defined process.

&amp;nbsp;

Almost as quickly as the ‘attack’ had started it ended, $Selben headed to a meeting with $Tex and some VIP. The meeting was about something to do with all VIP’s getting the best wireless mice on the market or something equally important that actually had a secretary as well as three other VIP’s on the phone, highly important stuff (*eye-roll engaged*). $Tex left the highly important meeting early, abandoning $Selben to fend for himself. After a rigorous series of question regarding having to explain DPI (*repetitively pronounced 'Dipee' by one of the VIP’s*) $Selben made it back to his cubicle just in time for lunch.

&amp;nbsp;

After a rather lackluster food truck lunch of much too spicy nachos, $Selben returned to utter chaos. His queue had hundreds of ‘questionable’ password requests, sifting through it appeared something was off. Almost none of the techs had bothered even asking the users for security questions and instead just escalated them. $Selben approached one of the less senior techs.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; $Selben: Hey there… What’s going on with the password resets.

&gt; $Peer: Oh, $Tex told us to just escalate those.

&gt; $Selben: Define ‘those’…



$Peer paused and looked uncomfortable.

&gt;$Peer: Any password reset request?… Because he said they were some thing from the security team.

$Selben let out a sigh.

&amp;nbsp;

After a short confrontation with $Tex, $Selben headed back to his desk and re-assigned out the tickets for the techs to try to followup with the customers per normal.

&amp;nbsp;

After the fiasco the security team was scrutinized by $Tex, who was in turn scrutinized for telling the techs about the test as it was meant for them. All of the techs became extremely cautious (*they were fine before*) on the level of unhealthy due to fear of being chewed out by both $Tex and the security team.",talesfromtechsupport,714,1558562596
xinkecf35,"I am sorry sir, but we are not going able to recover your very important code from these 5000 directories","So I am currently a student working in the walk-in helpdesk my university has. Most of my job primarily consists of helping people, mostly students, installing programs like Office and Matlab as well as getting people connected to WiFi and occasionally reinstalling OSes. We do also help with other technical issues beyond what is officially supported and sometimes those cases, shall we say can be fun.

Before we start, let us set the scene.
&gt;
**$ME**: Wannabe software engineer who dabbles in system administration. 
&gt;
**$GRAD**: a STEM graduate student who I will be helping.

Now before we continue, I want to be clear that while we do help people with most technology issues, the level of support for some problems is limited by the knowledge of whoever happens to work at the desk that day. Additionally, there are a few things we will typically not do for users, like data recovery (this will be pertinent in a moment), and after this case, I am perfectly content to leave it that way.

So I come into work and am handed off a case by another tech, being a student, has a class to get to. I was told that they were doing some stuff overnight with **$GRAD’s** machine and he is just restoring files. I say okay and sit with **$GRAD** and help him do so. When I pick the case up, he is currently booted into a live Mint drive we have and using the search bar in the file explorer to try to find files. So far not too unusual, we do this occasionally to allow users to get retrieve data if the machine cannot boot to the OS on the device and we cannot pull hard drives out of machines to access files that way as we are not permitted to do so.

Now, as he is doing this, I start reading through the case history, and as I do, I get a sinking feeling as I begin to realize what that something was. Apparently, **$GRAD** had come in a few days ago and had somehow lost all his files in some accident, maybe something involving a botched Ubuntu upgrade. Being sympathetic, the initial tech that worked with him got permission to do data recovery with a free tool he found online.

Now, note I said we typically don’t we do data recovery. However, I suspect I am the reason why the request was approved. The supervisor, though fantastic, was new and so at the time was a little unfamiliar with some of our policies. A few weeks prior, I had also asked permission and got approved to recover a word document for another customer using PhotoRec, a free software I had used in the past. Whoops. 

As it so happened, it appeared that the tech had landed on the same one. This guess was based on the fact that the directories were named in the same way that PhotoRec generates directories as it recovers files.

Now for those of you who have never use PhotoRec before, you must understand that the software *does not* recover file metadata, you can only recover by specific types of files. That means that whatever you tell it to find, you won’t get the original file name back. So I now had this poor sap in front of me, trying to find his files by what he names them which was not possible because the tool we used did not recover metadata. Strike one.

IIRC, I believe that best practice for data recovery is that one should only make read-only operations from the media you are recovering from. Also, one should ideally create a forensic copy of the media and operate on that instead so that further data loss can be assured against in case you need to do more recovery operations on the device in question.

Well, given the amount of data that was recovered and the lack of another storage device besides the live USB which we were booted into, I am reasonably sure that none of those things happened. The original tech had started the operation on the original drive and let the recovery destination be on the same device we were recovering from, a less than ideal scenario. We very likely overwrote data during the recovery process. Again, I don’t blame the tech, we don’t get trained for data recovery, and we don’t have hardware lying around to make a forensic copy of the devices for the purposes of data recovery.

At this point, realizing the scope of the task before us, I started pressing the user for precisely what the heck we are looking for. Apparently, **$GRAD** had just wrapped up his masters, and he was trying to recover some CUDA program that he had written in C that he used to do simulations as part of his research. At this point, I had the following conversation with him
&gt;
$ME: So the program our tech used unfortunately does not recover file metadata. That means that you will not be able to find the files the way you are trying right now. If you don’t mind, can I please take a look at the computer so I can get an idea of the number files recovered and see what we can do as of right now. 

I fire up a terminal and with the help of a colleague, determine there are almost 5000 directories generated by PhotoRec. And all are filled to brim with files. And there were many C files. And many other files as well. Well, I had another conversation with the user. 
&gt;
$ME: Well okay, there almost 5000 directories filled with files. Out of curiosity, where did you run this program?
&gt;
$GRAD: I ran at on the supercomputing cluster the university has access to.
&gt;
$ME: Okay, is there a copy of the program on there?
 &gt;
$GRAD: Well, there used to be, I recently closed my account as I was done with the project.
&gt;
$ME: Okay, well about Box, OneDrive, maybe another a computer in your lab? How about Github?
&gt;
$GRAD: I wouldn’t be here if there were another copy, would I?
&gt;
$ME: Fair enough.

It turns out, there only existed ever two copies of the program, one on his computer and one on the supercomputing cluster (Sidenote: despite knowing the stereotype, it shocks and surprises me the number of graduate students I have helped in recovering their critical work).

At this point, my other supervisor is now antsy about this case and its circumstances. I decide at this point it is pretty much game over and it is time to cut **$GRAD** loose. 
&gt;
$ME: Okay so at this point, beyond writing a shell script to look through all the files across these 5000 directories and trying to match specific function signatures inside those files, there is nothing more we can beyond install a new operating system to the computer and making it usable again. Even if you did that, there are no guarantees that the files were recovered in their entirety and may very well not be usable. If I were you were, I would at this point contact the supercomputing center and see if your files are still there. Otherwise, I will have to refer you to a data recovery specialist. 

To the user's credit, he took the news very calmy and left with his machine in tow, and I close the case. I debriefed with my supervisors about what happened, and we firmly made clear that we **did not** do data recovery.

All's well that ends well;  a few days later, I see $GRAD come back. The supercomputing center, following good practice, still had his data, and $GRAD was able to get his program back. He had come back asking for assistance installing Ubuntu to his machine, which I helped him do. As I checked in the machine, I strongly recommend that I, among other things, install git to his computer and suggested that he uses that along with Github to keep track of his code.",talesfromtechsupport,1506,1558551490
gthaatar,"""Grab the cord firmly by the the plastic wire and, with a light amount of force, pull backwards."".......*click*","So, I work for a cable company. And I took a call last week that was, one of -those-. It was an old lady who obviously didn't know much about how computers work, which is fine normally, I can deal with that. But she was also a Karen type that insisted on being a Karen the entire time. Lovely start.   


She had an issue with her router not providing putting out a wifi signal, which was a relatively easy fix in the end as our routers have had an ongoing issue where they get stuck in some kind of boot process, and the interim fix is to just unplug it and plug it back in to force a reset on it. Now this issue is fixed for us, but we were right in the thick of it when I had Karen on the phone.   


Problem was, because she wasn't savvy whatsoever at this, it took a half hour to get to this point. I had to come up with may be 15 different ways to ask the questions I had to ask to diagnose where the problem was (and for that matter what the problem was. We spent a good portion of the call working on her cable when she finally mentions its her internet).   


And once I got there, I rolled out my little prefab explanation that I had honed in over countless people calling in with the same issue, and she seemed to understand it.  


Up until I explained what to do. She flipped and started yelling at me because she didn't know how to unplug it. (note, this was not the first thing she complained about not knowing how to do, despite me explaining the actual technical stuff I needed her to do beforehand. This was the one time I didn't preface with a how-to)   


And she just went off for a couple minutes and I was so flabbergasted that she was seriously saying she didn't know how to pull out a plug that I literally asked her if she understood what unplugging means. That didn't go over well as you can imagine, but whatever.   


So, because my fellow cubicle people are all good jokesters and what not, I stood up and spoke up a bit so they could hear me as I explained in great detail how to unplug the cable, using the exact wording in the title. And as my coworkers started cracking up she clicked off.   


In general I have a great deal of patience with people that don't know any better (I aspire to be a teacher, so it comes naturally to me) so I'm not going to get frustrated when somebody doesn't know how to check what WiFI they're connecting to or how to forget the network (two common things I have to explain in detail).   


But when its something simple, like reading the entire error on a screen, or unplugging a cord, I can't say I have any sympathy. If you're that hopelessly inept I honestly cannot recommend that you continue bothering to engage with technology. Either get someone with a few more brain cells left to help or go without man.",talesfromtechsupport,1555,1558501333
GreenEggPage,Giving out the keys,"Back around the turn of the century, I worked tech support for an ATM transaction processor. Back then, PIN encryption wasn't so great and we actually gave the encryption keys out over the phone to the onsite technician to enter. We used the phonetic alphabet for hexadecimal keys and after the first few times, techs would know it and key issuance was pretty quick. We weren't supposed to talk to the merchants. We would give them their ISO's phone number and then, when the ISO sent a tech out, we'd talk to him (or very rarely, her).

Well, one day a merchant calls in. He can't get ahold of his ISO (or the ISO was ignoring him or was a piece of crap) and he really wanted to get his ATM up and running. This gentleman was very nice but had one of the thickest Indian (or Pakistani, I can't tell the difference) accent I had heard at that time. I get approval from the big boss to walk him through entering the keys and the conversation went something like this... (remember to use the worst stereotypical accent for him possible)

Me: Okay, no press the number 2 key 3 times. You should see and ""B""

Merchant: I press 2... 2... 2 and I haf a B!

Me: now press the right arrow key. Then press 4 once, you should see ""4""

Merch: I press right arrow key and... The B went away!

Me: that's OK! Its supposed to change to a star. Now press 4 and the ln right arrow key.

Merch: I press 4 and I see a 4! Now it is a star!

This continued on for a good 10 minutes. He was so happy, upbeat, and proud every time he got the right result. Towards the end, I was having troubles not laughing. When we finally finished - at that time it was 32 characters - he sounded depressed and sad that it was over. We got his ATM up, though.",talesfromtechsupport,963,1558413565
jaxder_jared,You crack my back I...fix your WiFi,"Short and Sweet, classic ""you're a wizard Mr. IT guy story.""

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, I was having some back problems (mid-twenties, overweight, thousands of hours with my face glued to a computer screen, you know the drill) and found a local back-breaker (chiropractor). Called him up, scheduled an appointment, and went there a couple of days that week.

At my first appointment, I knew right off the bat that I wasn't going to like him. I went into his office, and the previous patient's data was right in front of me on these two 40"" displays. I could see this person's X-Rays and likely other data that I blotted out of my head. He asks what I do for a living, and I tell him I work in IT at \[hyper-local university\]. He then mentions something about the WiFi being cruddy, cue the Jaws soundtrack for a moment, then we proceed with the rest of our appointment and he ~~breaks~~ adjusts my back.

Second appointment, and we go about our appointment as normal. Then the tech in the back of the room complains to him about the laptop as I'm doing mobilization exercises. Cue the soundtrack again. He comes up to me in the middle of these exercises and asks if I can take a look at it after I'm done. He tells me he'll comp my visit if I can fix it...so I finish up, go to the back of the room, see that the SSID isn't broadcasting, and asked where the router is. He shows me to a room with horrible cable management and points to a router from \[colors that come out of a prism\] company. He leaves me there, I unplug it and plug it back in.

He comped me the visit and I haven't been back since. I don't want to be my doctor's IT guy.",talesfromtechsupport,1307,1558368924

smurfheart,"It's too much work, just remote on and fix it or send someone.","I work helpdesk at a large sized medical institute and we utilize a rather common Microsoft drive encryption program, which sometimes after updates it locks the computer up, thus requiring a recovery to be performed. Today a user had an issue where her computer and monitoring board both had the recovery screen up.  The monitoring board is placed up on the wall for the staff to monitor vitals and other information of the patients. Designed to be only worked on by IT staff remotely or an onsite PC technician.

The recovery process is simple, easy, and common. They give me set of characters provided by the recovery screen, I in turn give them a long int value back. They enter the int value and 'BAM' the computer is working again.  Due to knowing that I would need to page a PC technician to come on site to resolve the monitoring board issue, I at least wanted to get the user's computer up and running so she wasn't sitting around for over an hour waiting. 

I walk her through getting the code I need from her to produce the recovery key. All the while she is stating that this an 'URGENT ISSUE' or a 'CRITICAL ISSUE'.

$ME: You should have an option for Next or Continue that will bring up the key field. 
$User: Can't you just send someone!?
$ME: Okay... *Gather contact information*

Once the company hired a consultant for 6 times my salary.

That guy **could not** understand the reasoning behind a simple if statement (very basic software development building block, you are supposed to learn it in the few first days as a student).

I have a few desks between me and my junior, one day I got up and walked the guy around the complex to calm him down, he hadn't said anything but was obviously fuming while debugging the consultant code, so I tried to calm him down before something bad happened...

2-3 days later **I blew up**... I had been trying to get the guy off the project because we where tired of his s**t breaking everywhere and had shown the boss a long series of  bad code he wrote or copied of the internet or something, but the boss brushed it off has a ""team integration"" phase.

The day before I done some 4-5 extra hours just to try to make his junk at least work as intended, I was pissed.

Got to work, entered the room pulled the plug on his computer and

Boss: What happened?

Me: (screaming) I no longer care, that guy is off my team, he can't even write an if statement.

Boss: but he may be a good programmer and just bad with ifs

Me: i don't care, next you are going to tell me he can be illiterate but be a good programmer.

Boss: you can't do this, you have just made yourself incompatible with the guy.

Me: not my problem, i also removed his code access permissions yesterday, now he can't break my team's work, he is now your problem not mine.

Boss: ...

That guy was fired that day, boss was pissed, team was happy.

To clarify, we did try to integrate the guy in the team, we spend hours looking at his code and going nearly line by line over what was wrong with it. He also never followed a single instruction given to him, be it to comment/document the code or just simply committing it so it could be reviewed.

During a lunch we learned why he was so bad, his attitude was ""once it works, it works, who cares how"" he simply refused to learn and winged it until it worked or someone else made it to work.",talesfromtechsupport,1161,1558207069

Selben,Donut Ambush,"**$Selben:** Me! “Technical team lead” previously Tier II helldesk helpdesk technician for a mid-sized company, very skeleton-crew helpdesk 10 of us total for 24 hour coverage (not including supervisors) to support 2500+ company-wide.


**$Snickers:** My cubicle mate, also “Technical team lead” previously Tier 2. (Tier 2 was a more advanced tech, having more experience and system access etc…)

**$Tex:** A new IT supervisor, spurs, cowboy hat the mustache… Yep the real deal.


**$Focus:** One of our IT Supervisors - She has a heavy programming background - She went back to her old team for some time after not doing so well as a lead, but is brought back after going through some more brainwash… er additional ‘leadership training’.

&amp;nbsp;

The hint of stale coffee and old sweat was permeating the office as a series of chimes from each of the techs’ machines acted like surround sound as their email notifications for “urgent” went off. After reading the email and seeing no one budging, $Selben looked around. None of them would meet his gaze.

&amp;nbsp;

The current office configuration consisted of a circle of inner-connected desks with a jumbo-tron style set of televisions hung in the center that displayed incoming calls and tech support statistics (See: [Ain’t this Nice Y’all parts 1 and 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)). There were very few active tickets. Most of the techs were waiting around for incoming calls. Based on the suspicious lack of action from his peers, $Selben read the email once more to make sure he wasn’t missing something.

&amp;nbsp; 

&gt; Free donuts in the main staff kitchen. Get them while they’re fresh!

&amp;nbsp;

$Selben’s stomach let out a growl. Giving a final glare around the room, he scooped up his empty coffee mug and headed to the main kitchen.

&amp;nbsp;

The door was slightly ajar. Peering cautiously through the crack, he couldn’t see anything readily amiss. He slowly pushed the door open and entered. Opening the bright pink box, he was pleasantly greeted by a nearly complete dozen. After making a selection and discovering it was still soft and clearly fresh, he refilled his coffee mug. Happily spinning on his heel with a little dance, he turned for the door intending to return to his desk when he stopped dead in his tracks.

In the doorway stood an $HRep. Her eyes locked on him like a lion seeing an antelope. $Selben froze in the same manner as the antelope. The kitchen only had one exit, besides the window, anyway. He briefly considered this but let out a small sigh and put up his shiny smile instead.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; $Selben: Good morning $HRep.

 

He tried slowly walking towards her, intending to slip by, but she stood firm.

 

&gt; $HRep: Did you enjoy the donuts we brought in?

 

$Selben considered throwing the donut at her to escape. Nothing good came from HR “bumping into you in the hall.”

 

Without waiting for him to answer, she continued.

 

&gt; $HRep: Oh, I wanted to show you something. You should come see!

 

She turned and extended her arm in a direction, clearly showing he had no option but to follow.

&amp;nbsp; 

He followed her deep within HR territory. An all glass conference room was on a raised platform in the center ~~and appeared to be waiting for an execution gallows to be installed~~. $Selben instantly spotted the ripped open boxes of clearly “ill gotten goods” (not through the IT department): tablets, an off-brand projector, as well as some sort of conferencing equipment with a camera and small monitor. One of the higher ranked HR reps flashed a razor tooth smile as she approached, clapping her hands in approval of $Selben’s existence and giving a nod.

&amp;nbsp;  

&gt; $HRLead: We have our monthly meeting tomorrow. Go ahead and get these setup for us. Thanks.

&amp;nbsp;  

Both HReps shared knowing smiles of having captured their prey and closed the glass door. They sat on chairs outside, effectively sealing $Selben inside the cleverly devised trap.

&amp;nbsp;  

$Selben knelt over one of the boxes and began to rummage through while slipping his phone out of his pocket sending an urgent text to $Snickers asking for help. No response. He pulled out a couple of the tablets and grimaced. They were the cheapest possible option you could get and would never do what HR had planned.

&amp;nbsp;  

After 30 minutes of head shaking, hopelessness, and growing terrified he’d never be released from this glass prison, he spotted a familiar ponytail moving among the HR cubicles. $Focus rounded the corner, with $Snickers trailing behind her as she approached the door to $Selben’s cage. She turned to face both $HRLead and $HRep, who felt their prize was being contested. The room was soundproofed, but things clearly were getting heated: $Snickers was occasionally flinching while cowering behind $Focus. Both $HRLead and $Focus would pound their fists into palms and alternatingly took power stances when defining their argument. With a final blow and an accusational pointing, $Focus won. The $HRep ran back to her cubicle. $HRLead stood defiantly, but as $Focus opened the door, she moved out of the way to let $Selben pass. He closely followed $Focus out of HR’s domain, with $Snickers right on his heels.

&amp;nbsp;  

$Focus spoke without turning around.

&amp;nbsp; 

&gt; $Focus: They did not have a ticket and did not put in a request for that equipment. I told them they can support it themselves unless they order through IT and follow procedure!

&amp;nbsp;  

$Selben was about to thank her but she stopped and turned.

&amp;nbsp;  

&gt; $Focus: And BOTH of you need to grow a pair! (She said half joking)

&amp;nbsp;  

On that, she rolled her eyes and confidently returned to her office. Protecting her little antelopes was part of her job, after all.",talesfromtechsupport,790,1557973787
pinky0926,No we don't want that. It's too expensive and we want something *bespoke*.,"*Bespoke.* The enemy of useful. 

We built a database software. Our clients use this database software. It contains a bunch of information that's important to them. You know how it goes. 

**Client:** It takes too long for our internal team to do all the admin of creating new people records. Is there any way people can sign up to the database themselves? Here's the specs of everything we'd need it to include. 

**Me:** Actually, yes. We have a web portal solution for this already. It does what it says on the tin. They just fill in the online form, it pops their details straight into the database. You pretty much just switch it on. Here's the price. 

**Client:** No, I'm afraid that's not what we want. We want a bespoke solution. One that's ours, so that we can build it how we want. 

**Me:** Ok, but can I ask...for what particular purpose? Looking at your specs here, the portal does everything you need. We can even brand it to look like yours so no one could tell the difference. Also critically, this is directly fed into the database, complete integrated and configurable.

*Client: No, I'm afraid not. Truthfully, we want to have more control over how it's developed. Also it's too expensive. Thanks anyway. 

*8 weeks later*

**Client:** We have a CSV file with lots of people on it. Any way we can import this information into the database on a regular basis?

**Me:** Where is this file coming from? What's on it?

**Client:  Well remember we asked a while back about getting people to register themselves? We created an online registration form. This creates a CSV which saves to google docs.

*client proceeds to show me a wordpress template form, and everything on it is wrong*

**Me:** ....Well we'd basically need to create a bespoke XML script that finds the file, maps out all the data and pings it into the right spots. This would need to be on a schedule and have a bunch of requirements to ensure the data is clean and not duplicated. It would need to be validated, truncated where necessary, etc. That will cost at least X much. 

**Client:** What? That's insane, why is it so expensive? 

*Because it's bespoke.*",talesfromtechsupport,2365,1557934346
jml9689,I Almost Made A Doctor Retire Early,"BACKGROUND: In the not so distant past, I worked for a doctors office group. Desktop support was my main role, but I had to do a little of everything some days. The medical field can be very frustrating and hectic, especially when the people around you are in sour moods constantly. One doctor in particular was very difficult to deal with when things got rough. If things were running smoothly, he was easygoing, calm, and fun. If one thing went wrong, he would throw very childish temper tantrums. The following story is a retelling of one of those childish temper tantrums.

&amp;#x200B;

This doctor was very resistant to change. While all of his other colleagues used shiny new Microsoft Surface Books with Windows 10, he insisted on using a 3-4 year old (at the time) Fujitsu LifeBook running Windows 8.1. This was due to his preference of Windows 8.1's handwriting recognition as well as our IT department not being able to migrate this handwriting data over to Windows 10. My boss (the IT Director) was very butt-kissy towards the doctors and executives. My boss made a big deal that this particular laptop was to never join the domain, never receive Windows Updates, and had to be treated with kid gloves at all times. I soon found out why. At this point, I have worked there for 3-4 months and knew many, but not all of the ""gotchas"" of this environment.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;DOCTOR: \*Stops me in the hallway on my way to eat lunch\*  
&gt;  
&gt;I need you to take a look at my laptop. My daughter logged into it with her account and it's not acting right.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;ME: Okay, I'll take a look at it now.  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Notices his laptop is asking to log in with a Microsoft account with his daughter's name\*  
&gt;  
&gt;Does your daughter usually log into your laptop at home like this?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;DOCTOR: No, this was the first time. Just get rid of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;ME: \*Removes the account, notices an account name with our usual user naming convention is still present, thinks all is well\*  
&gt;  
&gt;I just removed that account. Go ahead and log back into it.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;DOCTOR: \*Logs in\*  
&gt;  
&gt;Why are all my icons missing? Why isn't my handwriting being recognized?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;ME: \*Starts getting concerned, realizes I deleted his usual account\*  
&gt;  
&gt;I thought this was the account you always used! I'll need the laptop back to revert the changes I made.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;DOCTOR: You better hurry because I have a patient to see right now!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;ME: \*Hands the doctor the site's loaner laptop for emergencies such as these\*  
&gt;  
&gt;This has access to the EHR programs (they're RDP-based so his laptop is just a mobile thin-client) and should have you all set for this patient.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;DOCTOR: I can't use that! You're going to make me retire early! This is ridiculous!  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Grabs one of his PACs to do the EHR work for him\*

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm getting concerned. I'm trying to find the fastest way possible to put things back where they were. Doing a system restore looked like it worked, but it failed and didn't restore the missing account. This ate up 10-15 minutes. I tried this again, same result. Tried a system restore from safe mode, same result and more time lost. Finally, I tried a system restore but booted into safe mode immediately afterwards. The account was restored, so I did one more reboot and everything was finally back the way it was an hour ago.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;ME: I think it's fixed now. The account is showing up again. Go ahead and log back in.  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Doctor logs back in, I disassociate his daughter's Microsoft account from the local account\*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;DOCTOR: You did it! You gave me a free stress test, but you fixed it!  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Shakes my hand, smiles, goes on about his day while I finally go eat lunch\*

&amp;#x200B;

EPILOGUE: It turns out that doctor's primary local account was named ""user"" instead of the one with our usual naming convention. At first glance, I thought his daughter's Microsoft account was a new user account instead of linking his usual local account (he has local admin rights). This was 100% my mistake, and I let the doctor-level pressure affect my judgement. It was also not the first time he threatened to retire early (he uses this as a leverage tactic to get his way during important meetings). I checked on him a couple more times afterwards and everything was fine.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: A doctor let his daughter use his work laptop at home. She messed with it, I made it worse accidentally, then I fixed it. Said doctor threatened to retire early due to this issue and refused to use a loaner laptop. He makes this threat fairly often and I don't work there anymore.",talesfromtechsupport,847,1557884206
Roughshod_Garage,Why it is important to 'not' layoff the competent,"From ages ago so things will not be perfect.  
  
Umm, does anyone remember the when a certain Northern country pledged support for the interventions in the Middle East? Where a small amount of FA-18's went over over?  
  
Can't be too far from people's memory, it was a short time ago.
  
Key to this story is understanding how how all of those planes received their communications via a place I will call 'low temperature pond' - LTP. National Defence is renowned for it's ability to keep running junk from ages past, parts so old they have been rebuilt dozens of times and cost a fortune to do so (I once found the group of machines handling a large part of the phone system, all running Windows Embedded cruising along with Celeron 300's). The military hires contractors to maintain this gear, specifically one large unnamed phone company to handle most, if not all, of their PBX and network requirements.

The company making this gear? Nortel. Nortel made a HUGE amount of gear that the military bought, that still runs today, that an ever-dwindling amount of people know how to repair. These lads know how to code the big phone systems, how to finesse and caress them back into working order, how to treat a PBX right.

Eventually, a certain phone company fired them all (or most) and replaced them with cheaper trainees. You know the routine.  

Let's get back to the Middle East.

Unaware of events transpiring; I'm at my desk, just a lowly admin, doing changes and inputting things here and there, when I overhear my colleague making calls. He's frantic, voices are getting louder, the call moves to the boardroom where much almost-shouting ensues. We all can hear the jist - there is a problem with communication from LTP and the jets in Syria.  
  
SLA stipulates any downtime will be met with penalties if it is over 15mins. The outage is currently at 60mins. Money is being lost, people are getting spicy, jets even spicier. My colleague is trying everything he knows - resetting things, weird commands I'm barely familiar with, instructing the 'new' on site support guy how to reboot the system manually. Support dude is clueless, he's never had to do anything remotely like this and in way over his head. Military is getting angry, it is now approx 24hrs since frosty PBX went down.  
  
An idea is hatched: what about the old tech? He worked on this exact unit for years, knew it like his children, perhaps he could help? Oh wait, you let him go.  
  
Much tracking down finds him a few towns over at a computer shop working the tech things. A call is placed and situation explained.  
  
'Sorry, I cannot fix it from here' is relayed.  
  
A bargain is struck - they want him to go back on site as a contractor and sort the mess out. Travel time included, min. 1hr charge.  
  
He leaves work right away, it's a 30min drive to LTP. Gets on site, he knows where he's going, rolls into the PBX room, performs magic.  
  
If anyone has known these old Nortel PBX's, they use cards. Huge things, like a foot square, which must be placed into the machines in specific orders else it won't work. Some of the weirder machines need them placed in even more specific orders not found in manuals. Years of constant rebuilds have left a lot of these cards cranky, you need a special person whom can commune with the machine gods to feel the PBX's pain.  
  
These people are magicians, the knowledge they possess cannot be taught, it must be learned through trial and error, sweat and frustration, constant swearing and pleading.  
  
We lay them off at ever alarming rates, then hire them back at 2x their original salary as 'consultants'. Or, in the ""PBX Whisperer's"" case, 5k an hour. He was on site for 5min, PBX came back to life without issue, LTP was speaking to it's jets. Everyone is happy.  
  
Dude drives home (this is included in the travel time btw), was working for 65ish minutes, 2hrs billable. Not a single blink was made at his bill.  
  
The system had been down for over 48 hours.",talesfromtechsupport,1000,1557846004
OnSiteWarlock,The BSDfH or the Bastard Service Desk from Hell!,"I work in IT for a big car manufacturer (40.000 employees at this plant alone) and we use a tool to document cables, switches, firewalls, routers, servers and stuff. For this tool you need a user/password to do your work.

I started working here at march and we requested this user for me shortly after I started working here. We know that for some tools it will take some time to get the requested users. We applied for my user in march and we waited for a mail telling me to set a password, using my initial password and start working with this tool. Weeks passed and at some point we got suspicious and requested a status update. Turned out, the user has never been applied for! OK, sometimes things get lost, lets do it all over.

The feedback from service desk was ""User has been created."" and we mailed back ""Nice, but why did the user NOT receive his initial password?

I work retail tech support, think Nerd brigade style tech support, but with more sales side involved. Being that I do sales, I'm also required to help set up new product displays. My manager was having issues getting the new displayer to turn on. Having nothing better to do I decide to go help.

I begin by going over the basics, is it plugged in, is it switched on (were talking extreme basics, basically a circuit board with some lights attached) and csnt figure it out. I double check the power and realise that only 1 of the 2 prongs is in the outlet, the other is sitting snuggly next to the outlet.

atombomb1945,IT should put a note on the computers or something...,"So this happened last week, I am still trying to wrap my head around the general ability for some people to breathe let along operate a computer.    


Ticket comes in, the Projector and computer in the classroom are both showing black screens.  The issue we have been having is the computer defaulting to the projector when the monitor is turned off.  We have told the departments several times not to turn off the computer monitors, just the projectors.  And yet this is still an issue.  But normally, one screen or the other will show something.  I make my way over to the classroom and find the instructor bringing up the class work on the projector so I asked if there was an issue.  


Instructor:  ""Oh there was until about a minute ago when I looked down and realized the computer was turned off.""

&amp;#x200B;

Me:  ""Well that would be why it wasn't working.  So everyth....""  


Instructor:  Pointing a finger at me.  ""You know, you guys should put a sign up or something telling us to make sure the computer is turned on.""

Me:  ""......""

&amp;#x200B;

Instructor:  ""I mean, I didn't even think to check to see if the computer was turned on when I came in here.  It normally is on.  You should have a note taped up here that tells us we should check to see if the computer is turned on!""

&amp;#x200B;

Me:  Looking around the room to see several students looking at the Instructor like she had just had an alien pop out of her chest.  ""Well, I mean, yeah.  We should probably look into putting a note on the computers telling people that they have to be TURNED ON in order to work.  But you are up now so I will let you get to your class.""

_Volly,Manager wants to replace Salesforce with a different system just to save 3 clicks. Yep - 3 clicks.,"This is happening to me RIGHT NOW so I can give you the moment by moment of utter stupidity I'm having to currently deal with. 

I'm the Salesforce Developer/Administrator for a small company. My skill set: 10+ years of experience, worked for Fortune 100 companies on large Salesforce projects so I know what I'm doing. I normally love my job for my boss is really cool and trust me and my judgement on how to do things. 

The story: I have this manager of a small support team who I will call Ginger. And what Ginger is asking for and making a big fuss about...OMG. 

If you have used Salesforce you most likely have seen a Case. When you click on the Cases tab you can select a View and see a list of Cases. In this situation for this team they see a list of Cases that are owned by a queue. A queue is nothing more than a parking lot of sorts to assign an owner to a Case when you don't have a person to assign the Case to.

When you want to assign the Case to you or another person when it is owned by something else you view the Case and click the word ""Change"" next to the Case owner and change it. This takes 4 clicks normally to do and 10 seconds.

Anyway what Ginger wants is when you simply view the Case, the ownership of the Case is automatically switched to you. 

&amp;#x200B;

**ALL JUST TO SAVE 3 CLICKS AND 10 SECONDS. Yep, you are reading this correctly.**

&amp;#x200B;

She is INSISTENT she get this functionality even if it means replacing Salesforce with a different system. I'm staring at the long email chain with attached word doc and everything where she says this right now as I type this post.  

Now to be clear - I had a phone call with her and shared my screen with her showing her what she wanted isn't possible. Does that stop her? NOPE.

Also just to put perspective into what she is asking for: 

What she is suggesting is to replace Salesforce just to save a few clicks. That is very expensive as in like 6 to 7 figure money, would take a long time to do (like a year), would impact every system in the company for Salesforce is tied to everything and the stuff her team looks at is the central point in the system that everything else feeds off of, and would introduce different issues that may in the end make things worse off. Lets not mention this would mess up all the work on the cloud based data warehouse we have going on.   


*All for gaining 3 clicks and 10 seconds.*

drlellinger,Weird entitlement to know things better than the heads of IT Support,"Once upon a time a lady came in to our office demanding that ""we make her laptop working again.""

A little more back information on me: I was on of the two supervisors for the support team at the time:

**First part** (not actually happening to me first hand but was told this story immediately afterwards):

So we ran into asking what exactly does not work in the first place. She told us that she is not able to connect to a remote server anymore when she is at home, so we figured that she used the deprecated VPN client and wanted to install the new (Cisco) one. She became angry and thought she was entitled to use the old one (which is obvoiusly not possible anymore) because she does not want to learn new things anymore. We installed it anyway and told her that if she wants to continue her work she needs to adapt to the new client (which is in fact more user-friendly).

**Second part** (experienced that first-hand):

The same lady came in a few weeks later demanding that we restore her login, she said that she used to login into her local account (LOCALCOMPUTER\userid) not the domain account (DOMAIN\userid). She was logged in with her domain account at the time the laptop was on our desk and it seemed that she was using the local profile indeed for her daily work.

*Side note: I noticed that she reinstalled the old VPN client as well but that was not the problem. It would not have worked and the new one was still there*

We logged in with our Administrator account to reset her password her local password. She demanded that he explain every step to her so we explained and she lost her guts when Itold her that we are about to reset her local password. She yelled at me at even thinking about changing her password. I told her that there is nothing to worry about, because her domain account (which is also needed for other services including email, etc.) still uses her password and we don't touch it.
She told us it's the same password and we should not touch anything because she only uses her password or nothing.

MegabitMegs,"""Your email isn't working!""","I'm not necessarily in tech support for my main job, but can dabble in a similar role when certain co-workers are out of the office. Today, I got a phone call that made the office giggle.


**Me:** (Company name), how can I help you today?

**Customer:** (Already annoyed) I tried emailing over a document that (coworker) requested, but the email she gave me didn't work! 

**Me:** Okay, no problem. I can give you her direct email. 

**Customer:** (Sighing loudly - you can practically hear her foot tapping at this point) Fine. 

**Me:** Okay, her email is (insert here). May I ask what email she gave you?

**Customer:** It was www.(companyname).com! It kept bouncing all of my emails.

**Me:** ... Okay, well her direct email should work. Thank you!


Honestly, I had no idea how to break it to this woman that she had tried emailing *our website* without getting bitched out further so I just let it go. When I hung up the call one of my coworkers leaned over and said, ""Did I just hear someone try to email a www address, in this, 2019, the year of our lord?""

Me: Right, let me get your details and  we’ll sort it out. 

User: Well, yeah, it’s getting really annoying though. 

Me: Have you been getting these messages frequently? 

User: Yes. And I’ve done what I’m supposed to, I’ve reinstalled Windows everytime this message shows up. But it takes a really long time, like, 2 hours, and I just don’t have time for this anymore! 

Me: .....So let me just clean the hard drive for you. 

User: You what? Can I have lunch while you do this? I’m getting really sick of it and I have to finish my work in about an hour! Why haven’t you guys figured out a better system when this happens all the time?! 

Me: It’ll only take about 15 minutes. Let me just RDP to your computer and I’ll sort it out for you. There is no need to reinstall your computer, have you contacted us about this issue before? 

User: .....No. Why would I? I know what to do. What do you mean 15 minutes? That’s now how long it takes to reinstall Windows. 

Me: No. But I can clean your hard drive in that time. Just trust me on this one, okay?

Rootman,"""It is imperative, we need this file restored""","A frantic caller called a while back.  They needed a 'spreadsheet' file restored to the server that had 'just disappeared'.  *Hours* of collaborative work went into the file and it just up and disappeared.  

I looked and looked and could see no indications of the file ever having existed.  I look through every backup, incremental and full for the last 2 months.  Of course, I couldn't search for it by name in the backup catalog because they forgot what they named it. And surprisingly the user's Excel's MRU menu wasn't showing anything. It was nowhere on the entire server drive.  I even use a tool to search for all the file containing a word they *thought* was in the title and for that file extension. Quit often I find stuff that way that someone 'accidentally' moved. 

Then it downed on me to ask when the created the file.  Sure enough, they created it that morning.  This is an old remote site with an ancient server and no other recovery options except for recovery for backup, and the backups occur every night.  So a file created that day wouldn't be backed up yet.  Corporate is moving away from remote file servers and is actively forcing users to use OneDrive and Sharepoint, and of course the user didn't put the file in either of those.  He hates OneDrive and Sharepoint. 

This was 'simply unacceptable' and I HAD to do something about it.  I talked to his boss, and his bosses boss to explain that a file created on the server that same day never had opportunity to be backed up, so it could not be restored. Luckily for me I had a good working relationship with both the bosses so they took my word for it.  I then explained that the user should have put the file on Sharepoint or OneDrive instead of the file server. 

Last I heard the guy was working on into the night recreating the file again.  And this time it was on his own C: drive - he *still* wasn't using Sharepoint or OneDrive.  I can't wait for the call when *that* file just '*disappears*'. Corporate doesn't believe in doing an PC backups (!).  Oh, and it wasn't an Excel file like he indicated it was a word document using a large table, that's why the Excel MRU came up dry. Why he didn't even use the proper app is beyond me.",talesfromtechsupport,1888,1557341586

Oricu,"I worked at a ""Dress Code is: Geek, Despite the Fact That Nobody Actually Dresses Like That Outside of an 80s Movie"" company.","Deleted the first one as I forgot to remove the company name from the title! Oops. :)

&amp;#x200B;

This was back in 2005-2007.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually did enjoy the job until they started putting my main focus on not repairing/installing stuff but on *UPSELL UPSELL UPSELL*. I can upsell, I'm good at upselling, but I'm only good at upselling if I think it's something a customer/user would genuinely get some benefit from. That was one of my biggest arguments with management, refusing to lie to a customer to make a sale.

Also got yelled at a lot when that manager basically put a bait and switch in place and told sales staff to ""forget"" to recommend services they knew a customer would need or want as part of an in home setup and that continued until the three of us doing in home setups encouraged them to call the store and ask for $Manager by name and tell him exactly what think of his policy and maybe casually mention it's probably a violation of the state's bait &amp; switch laws (which I also pointed out to him numerous times).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, on to the story that caused the last big fight I had with that manager before he was transferred to a different department...

&amp;#x200B;

For this one, I have a pretty typical in home setup of two computers for a couple; get to their house, they are fantastically old. Like late 90s old.

&amp;#x200B;

I see the two computers: The lowest end, garbage, clearance eMachines Excellent Purchase sold at the time. But, you know what, it's probably fine; not everyone needs a speedy computer and, at least for the woman, she told me she doesn't like sitting in front of the computer and is perfectly happy turning it on, wandering away to do some baking, yard work, make some phone calls, etc...and when she gets back it's ready for her to open her e-mail to see if her kids have sent her any new pictures of their grandkids.

&amp;#x200B;

She already knew how to save those photos and print them and just straight up didn't care if it was slow.

&amp;#x200B;

Got hers set up first because she made some offhand comment about how her husband's computer had data to transfer and would take longer.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I get into his area and it is a fully kitted out photography and video editing studio.

&amp;#x200B;

I see his old computer that, even at 6 years old, was still better hardware wise than this garbage ass eMachine the sales guy told his wife (not him, as I found out later, he wasn't feeling well and was in the bathroom and the sales guy had been told to push the garbage clearance computers out the door ASAP) that the same computer would be perfect for him.

&amp;#x200B;

I try to figure out a polite way to say, ""This computer is actual trash,"" but instead go with, ""Okay, so what is it you usually do with your computer?""

&amp;#x200B;

The old dude lights up, starts talking about how he takes old film, gets it re-recorded and processed into digital recordings, does audo editing to fix the sound quality on some of the stuff, does a lot of video editing, music editing, a lot of stuff that a eMachine with integrated graphics 2GB of RAM, 4 whole USB ports, integrated sound, and the lowest end Celeron processor on the market at the time would just...not be able to do.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I let him finish talking because he was super excited about everything he did with his computer and he realized I was just kind of looking at the trash computer the sales guy had convinced his wife was good enough.

&amp;#x200B;

""What?""

&amp;#x200B;

""How honest do you want me to be about this computer?""

&amp;#x200B;

He looks at me, he looks at the computer, then nods and says, ""Completely.""

&amp;#x200B;

I explain to him that this is the same computer his wife has and, for what she wants to use a computer for, it's perfectly fine because she mentioned she doesn't like to sit at a computer and is cool with a computer that might take 10 solid minutes to fully boot then another 10 to open her e-mail because she can do other things. He agrees with a kind of adorable affectionate laugh and says that sounds like her.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, and you want to do some pretty intense video and audio editing and this computer, even if you sunk another $600 into upgrades, would still not do the job; this is a very low end computer and it's meant more for people who want to use their computer the way your wife uses hers.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Huh.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Thing is, the sales guys are being told to push this model because the store wants to get rid of it; it's been in the store for over a year and these were the last two on clearance.""

&amp;#x200B;

He asked what I recommend we do, especially since they live 40 miles from the store.

&amp;#x200B;

I tell him I'll get his computer packed up and head back to the store if they've got time to return it today. He says they do but they have to get dressed first.

They WERE dressed, but what he meant was basically get into their Sunday Best, suits, ties, fancy hats, nice dress, okay.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, cool, I tell him I'll box it all up, take it back to the store with the receipt and get the return process started. Asked him what his budget for a computer was, he said he could go up to $1200 ""with some wiggle room"".

&amp;#x200B;

Told him I'd pick out 5-6 different computers ranging from about $600-$1200, and when they got to the store, we'd go over the specs of each one and then discuss which computer would best meet what he needed for a new computer.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I get back, explain the situation, manager is of course pissed at me that I told a customer the store was wrong and was bringing back one of the garbage eMachines they were trying to offload. Small argument that was ""don't undermine the sales floor!"" vs ""Well then make sure the sales floor is *competent* and doesn't try to screw over customers so I have to have that conversation with the customers on site.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Walked away from that, by the time they showed up at the store all he had to do was sign the return receipt, I went and got them out to the floor, shooed every sales guy the hell away from us, and walked him through about 6 different computers that would all meet his needs.

&amp;#x200B;

Some needed a little upgrading, but nothing bank breaking (usually just more RAM or a larger hard drive), and gave him the usual, ""For this kind of thing, the more you put into it up front, the longer you'll usually be able to go with it before you need to look into upgrades or replacements.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He went for the highest end one he could afford, and also ended up buying two external hard drives for additonal portable storage so he could take his movies and slideshows and music to show to friends and family, bought a nice new printer, and a few decent video and photo editing suites.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, I made a BETTER sale than the original guy by actually taking time to figure out what the guy needed vs. ""Ugh just sell this trash computer, he's like, 95, he's not going to care.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Got written up for it for ""causing a return"" and ""undermining customer trust in the knowledgeability of our sales staff.""

&amp;#x200B;

Gave 0% fucks about it because that guy was over the moon and super excited to get back to work on his projects; he specifically requested I be the tech to go back out to get it all set up and show him how some of the newer stuff worked.

&amp;#x200B;

Didn't even need to show him all that much as he was actually a lot better at video and photo editing suites than I am. Most of what he needed help with was physically setting things up as he didn't have the physical strength to do it himself.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, the old guy was incredibly happy with his new setup and had started importing projects to get back to editing before I left.

&amp;#x200B;

Back at the store, I cornered the sales floor managed and asked him if he knew exactly how illegal some of the sales tactics he was forcing people to use were, printed out a bunch of stuff on the state's bait &amp; switch laws, then roped the GM in to continue giving that jackhole of a sales floor manager a well deserved tearing down.

&amp;#x200B;

GM was pissed but didn't fire the guy right away, he just moved him to Home Theater where he eventually was fired for doing the exact same thing, just with TVs instead of computers.

&amp;#x200B;

(As a bonus aside: Excellent Purchase will tell you they don't work on commission and it's technically true, they don't get any commission checks from sales they make.

What they won't tell you is that their hours are tied directly to their sales numbers and if you miss your arbitrary numbers, you get hour hours cut, sometimes down from full to part time or even lower than 25 hours per week; the reason they seem like they work on commission is because they kind of do in a shady technically not commission way.)

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. The customer profiling thing was real and I had to sit through a Saturday-Sunday stretch of all day all store meetings to go through it all and roleplay garbage out and the only shining part of that whole miserable ordeal was seeing the one manager nobody cared for be forced to dress in a full fursuit to be a 'mouse' chasing some other equally humiliated manager who was dressed as cheese.",talesfromtechsupport,813,1557264746
mikob,Usually angry reviews ruin my day... this time it made my week,"I make browser extensions, it's largely thankless work.

The emails and reviews you will get require a thick skin. If it doesn't work for a user's version of Chrome/Firefox -- guaranteed 1 star. If it doesn't have functionality X -- 1 star and ""I will come back and update my review if the developer updates \[except I won't\]"". There are no 2-4 star reviews because reviewers are extreme people.

Anyway, because I'm a masochist I decided to put an uninstall form that opens after a user removes my extension where they can optionally leave feedback. This has been excellent! Two reasons: 1) I can see why people are uninstalling and 2)

It's therapeutic! Not for me, some users really need an outlet after they yell at their screen and headbutt that uninstall button. Here's one I got today:

&amp;#x200B;

""OK SO FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE MICROPHONE. WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU DO WITH THE AUDIO. I FIND THAT VERY SUSPICIOUS AS A PRETTY PARANOID PERSON. HOPEFULLY YOU CAN REROUTE YOU AND YOUR CO-WORKERS MINDS TO HAVE THREE THINGS THAT I HAVE AND YOU DONT. A DEPTH PERCEPTION. A FUNCTIONING LIVER. AND A PULSE.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very glad that this user found an outlet and it was on my uninstall form rather than in the reviews. The thing is, my extension's only purpose is for surfing the web with your voice. It's a voice control extension. It's literally called \*word that rhymes with rip that is on your mouth\* and surf. The tagline is ""voice control for the web"". I'm not sure what they were expecting.

&amp;#x200B;

I know they're talking about the *customer's* network, but it still pissed me off.

Side note: my boss and I are workshopping a response t-shirt. ""It's Never the Network"" just doesn't have the right bite and ""Just because you're too dense to realize it's not the network doesn't make it the network"" is a bit long. Suggestions welcome.

So, with the general rage building, I figured I'd get some of the more asinine tickets off my back.

----

&gt; **$DBAdmin** [*via a Critical ticket*] $DevDB1 and $DevDB2 are experiencing high latency when communicating. [*as the justification for ""critical""*] This is holding up patch testing which is holding up patch QA which is holding up production patching which is, therefore, an issue with a customer-facing system.

&gt; **$Me**: First, I don't see $DevDB1 or $DevDB2 in our records. Can you send me their IPs so I can reference? Also, did you happen to change their hostnames? We like to keep a record of which services are named what exactly for this purpose. [*Read: Once again, you've decided to rename all your servers without telling us. Making you reply to this is your punishment*]

&gt; Second, we don't have any alerts or network issues reported during your timeline, are there any metrics you can provide that support the issue? These would help us narrow the issue down [*Read: I don't believe you, prove it*]

&gt; Finally, this problem does not meet the criteria for a Critical ticket; I've reset it to Trivial as per the guidelines *here* and on the ticket submission page. If you think this is incorrect or need it elevated, please email my supervisor and he can look into modifying the criteria. Please be aware that Critical tickets wake up key staff members during off-hours and so should be submitted only with great care. [*Read: you knew this was a Minor ticket because you make this ""mistake"" every time; as punishment, I'm demoting you to Trivial and our longest SLA*]

&gt; **$DBAdmin** Attached is the graph of communication, see the peaks at *time* and *time*. [*Note: no IPs, no comment on ticket priority*]

&gt; **$Me**: Thanks for the information; I have some new questions:

&gt; First, I still need those IPs.

&gt; I looked at that graph and I only see a chart of I/O vs. time. Your VMs use iSCSI storage so the ability to burst IO is actually a sign that the network is working well. Can you elaborate on what *problems* you are having?

&gt; **$DBAdmin** Here are the IPs. The problem is that the network drops causing the servers to have to replicate to the new master, this is killing the CPU.

&gt; **$Me**: Thanks, I checked those IPs and updated our hostname records. How are you replicating data if you say the network is dropping? Again, do you have any metrics that show the network issues? I've checked your hosts' switch ports and we don't see any serious traffic over the last few days nor any drops, so everything looks good. I've also roped in the VM team to take a look at the specific performance of your boxes. As Development VMs they are unlikely to have much in the way of excess resources so you should expect a CPU-intensive process to cause performance issues. Again, any network metrics would be appreciated because we're seeing nothing over here. [*Read: bullshit*]

&gt; **$VMAdmin**: [*My hero*] I've checked those VMs. It looks like the CPU spike precedes the Network spike by about 15 seconds. It looks like some CPU process caused the master's health to drop and the network spikes are just the failover traffic. If you want, we can look at allocating you some additional resources, but you requested that both VMs live on the same host, so there aren't many development boxes we can relocate you to.

&gt; **$DBAdmin** [*Radio silence*]

&gt; **$Me**: Does that sound correct, $DBAdmin?

&gt; **$DBAdmin** [*Radio silence*]

&gt; **$Me**: [*Ticket closed*]

&gt; **$HelpDesk** Hey, I need this port forwarded to the DMZ

&gt; **$Me**: Um, which port? and what do you mean by ""forwarded to the DMZ""? We have a DMZ switch, do you need a port activated there? If so, please note that we need Security approval for any public-facing services. We would also need a request for a NAT forward and allowed ports for your particular service--or a similar service we can template from. [*That's not how this works... that's not how any of this works*]

&gt; **$HelpDesk** This port [*includes a photo of an entire switch, a switch that looks suspiciously like one in our *office*, not the DC where the DMZ is.*]

&gt; **$Me**: First, we don't have a DMZ at the office, so I still need some more details about what you actually want. Second, if this switch is involved, I need you to specify which port, not just a photo of the entire switch. I tried calling your extension but there was no response, if you want to talk through this please call me when you are free.

&gt; **$HelpDesk** [*three days later*] I guess I need a public IP.

&gt; **$Me**: Oh! That's very different and doable. Please forward this ticket to security with the name, ports, and purpose of your service. As soon as they approve, I'll issue you a public IP.

&gt; **$Me**: I can't replicate this issue, nor can anyone else on my floor--so it's obviously something odd about your location or connection. Can you answer a few questions for me: What floor are you on? Are you wired or wireless? Are you using $VPN1 or $VPN2?

RexMcRider,I get yelled at for cleaning out deleted documents folder.,"TL, DR:  Goofy Controller users the ""trash bin"" to store documents she uses a lot, yells at ME for emptying the MASSIVE archive when trying to figure out why her computer &amp; printer aren't working correctly, then gets yelled at by MY boss for being an idiot when he asks me why she's pissed.  


OK, so we have AB - Awesome Boss. EBC - Entitled, Bitchy Controller.  


This is yet another tale that started as a printer issue.  I worked at a company for quite some years.  EBC had started there shortly after the Company was founded, and I was kind of an ""old timer"" myself at that point.  I was, at this time, running (for a company of about 50 people) virtually all of the technical, and a lot of non technical, stuff.  Phones, printers, facilities, whatever.  


Anywho, EBC calls one day.  Her printer isn't working right, and I think something about her computer.  This was quite awhile ago, so that exact problem escapes me, and esd utterly eclipsed by the fact that the concept of ""deleting"" seemed to have gone over her head (Yea, it was Windows, we'll be calling it what it is... trash... from here on.).  I sit down at the computer, looking at one thing and another.  I look in the recycle bin.  It's PACKED!  Huge amount of files!  I'm thinking ""Ah, getting rid of all that junk should help"".  You know, clear up some disk space and what not.  So:  Ctrl+A, DEL... BOOM! Lot's more disk space!  I get everything working, the printer is printing, and I mentally polish my fingernails on my chest for a job well done.  


I then get called over to her office, and something like this happens:  
EBC:  \*pissssed off\*  ""Where are all my DOCUMENTS?""  

Me: ""Huh?""  

EBC: ""My documents are gone!""  

Me: ""Show me"".

She opens the now empty trash folder. Yea, she was using that to STORE HER IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS!  I explained that this was a really bad idea, as someone doing tech support wouldn't think twice about deleting them, that's not what it was for, etc.  The idea that using the trash for storage was a BAD idea went no where with her.  She proceeded to chew me out, and then bitch to AB, (who is the COO and also HER boss).  He asks me what happened.  I explain debugging , massive number of deleted documents, used for storage, etc.  


The best part:  AB then got up, went to HER office, and pretty much told her she was an idiot for using the trash for storage and don't do that shit anymore!  One thing about AB... he used to yell a lot.  Sometimes, in conversation with me, he'd yell when he was pissed at someone else, not AT me, but just venting.  BUT he was very just.  He rarely yelled AT me when I didn't deserve it, and if I could show I didn't deserve it, he'd apologize.  Needless to say, EBC didn't have a good day that day, because she most assuredly deserved the butt-gnawing she got that day.  I heard it, and I was on the other side of the building.  I confess, the schadenfreude was in full effect that day.",talesfromtechsupport,1437,1557019512
DoubleBlindStudy,"Sir, with all due respect, we're dealing with a lot of s**t here","One of my first internships was with the DoD, more specifically the Navy. The job was located on-base, which meant a lot of older buildings that had messy, outdated wiring jobs since you get what you pay for in the DoD. Part of my job was to re-run and refresh everything from Cat 5e to Fiber to actual switches/routers. If you've never had that ""pleasure"" before, it involves a ton of crawling on your hands and knees, standing on ladders that have to be moved every few minutes, and otherwise doing hellish work in sweltering heat while in khakis and a polo because it's the Navy and air-conditioning apparently wasn't in their lexicon.

I'd just finished running one of the longest 5e runs between one of our labs and the ""official unofficial"" external connection. Long story short there - **$CTO** wanted to be able to surf Facebook and one of the labs needed to not have to deal with NIPRNet. Anyways, this run had taken me the better part of a Friday to get done. I checked to make sure everything was running smoothly, looked at the clock, filed for the three hours of overtime on my timesheet, and went home.

Now, one of the benefits of being the intern was I was technically not on-call (yet). So I had a lovely weekend and was unsuspecting when I walked into work Monday. Waiting for me was a very tired-looking and exasperated supervisor. The conversation went something like this:

&gt; **$S**: Thank god you're here. Something's wrong with that last run you did and **$CTO** can't get to Facebook. We've been trying to figure out why since Saturday.
&gt; 
&gt; $DBS: Oh. I can verify it was working when I left Friday at least.
&gt; 
&gt; **$S**: That's great, but if **$CTO** can't get to Facebook by lunch, he's already told me it'll be a fire-able offense.
&gt; 
&gt; $DBS: S**t.

If you haven't guessed already, **$CTO** was an ass. But since it was pretty much my ass on the line, I dove under those floor tiles and checked every inch of that line. Nothing wrong. I was sweating bullets when, on a hunch, I double-checked the actual rack that connected the run to our external-facing equipment. 

Now this rack was in a glorified broom closet that also had roof access built into it. None of our systems ran to stuff on the roof, but it's important. Why? Because, to my horror, that entire pipeline was *caked* in bird s**t. It was as if some higher power had fed mega-lax to every bird in a ten mile radius and had them void their bowels down this pipe. I don't know why we put equipment into this room uncovered, but we did. You can probably guess where my eyes went next. Sure enough, there was a copious amount of it on the backside of the servers. Enough to get into the back panels and short out things. I have no idea how I missed it the first time. Maybe it was my brain trying to retain my sanity.

As the intern, I debated how to proceed. I decided to bring **$S** in around 11:58am to show him in person what was going on. We were mid conversation when **$CTO** tracked us down.

&gt; **$CTO**: **$S**, you were told if I couldn't get out by lunch...
&gt; 
&gt; **$S**: Sir, with all due respect, we're dealing with a lot of s**t here
&gt; 
&gt; **$CTO**: Excuse me?
&gt; 
&gt; **$S**: \*points at the servers* Like I said, Sir, a lot of S**t.

Many expletives followed, but **$CTO** had a working braincell that day and didn't fire either myself or **$S**. A few days later I was installing the replacement equipment with orders to block up the roof access. Again, as the intern, I did what I was told. Nothing else happened that summer worth mentioning.

Three years down the line, I saw **$S** again during Happy Hour at one of the nearby bars. We swapped stories and in the process I learned that **$CTO** had gotten in trouble with some of the brass when some poor person (probably another intern) was trying to figure out where the roof access was supposed to be. He found it, alright, and about a gallon of crap on his head.",talesfromtechsupport,1067,1557012597
b4ux1t3,How DARE you lie to us?!,"So, I just put this in an AskReddit thread, but I realized you guys might get a kick out of it. I'm going to leave it as is, including with the notes to non-technical folks, mainly out of laziness. Enjoy!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I work in information security. We had a customer who were deploying a while new network security infrastructure. I was there to support one of the appliances specifically, as the company couldn't find anyone internally and didn't want to spend the money training someone. This is normal. Happens a lot. That's basically my company's bread and butter: being external, short-to-medium term residence SMEs.

So here I am, about a month in to this project, being told that the director of IT security was not happy with what I had been delivering, and claimed that I had lied to the company about key features of the product I was supporting.

For reference, the appliance does, but is not limited to, web content filtering and SSL/TLS decryption. It is important to note that this means that it can block content that comes (or is ""*downloaded from*""*,* this distinction, though technically unnecessary, is important in a second\*)\* from HTTPS websites.

I am called into a meeting with the director ($Director) of network security, a couple people with VP ($VPs) in their job titles, and the $POCs that I've been working with at the company, along with a sales engineer ($SE) from the vendor of the appliance. For context, it's kind of like you're called to the principal's office, and the superintendent for the school district, your teacher, and the people who make your textbooks are there. $Director immediately starts going off about the fact that this product doesn't do what it's advertised to do, and that the Vendor has lied to them, and so has the SME that was brought in (yours truly).

Specifically, he said that the appliance that I was supporting ""could not possibly block or even detect downloaded content"". Remember, this is *specifically* what it's designed to do. Why can't it do this?

""It only decrypts HTTPS.""

The room was silent for a solid ten seconds. $Director had just said, unequivocally, that it couldn't do something *because it can do one of the necessary steps for doing that thing.* For you non-technical folks, *t*hat's like saying ""this oven cannot bake a cake because it heats up"". Literally nonsense.

$SE, who is one of the best, most intelligent people I have ever had the privilege to work with, calmly asked $Director to explain what he meant. $Director responded with the words ""Are you fucking stupid?""

I went off! Okay, no, I didn't yell and scream and do everything that everyone fantasizes about. But I asked, in probably the most professional but least friendly way possible, if $Director could explain to us exactly how he thinks the process of web filtering happens within the context of encrypted traffic.

He got things. . .wrong. To say the least. But it all culminated in his saying ""And then the browser uses FTP to download the content from the website, and the appliance doesn't scan FTP!"" Not only is that statement wrong (you download things from websites using HTTP, whether or not it is encrypted. This is why URLs on the web invariably start with ""http""^(1)), he's also incorrect: the appliance *can* actually apply policy, scan, and block FTP traffic.

Again, for the non-technical of you, he essentially said ""This oven cannot bake a cake, because it can only bake cookies.""

Now it was my turn to be as professional as I possibly could. I explained that that was not how the process worked at all and that, although irrelevant to the conversation, since you don't use FTP at all, the appliance did actually have that capability.

When $Director *smugly* (emphasis for just how damned smug he seemed) turned to $POCs and $VPs, all but saying ""See, all lies!"", the main $POC spoke up and said ""Yeah, that's how we have things designed, and why we bought this specific appliance."" Then one of the $VPs decided to end the meeting.

$Director doesn't work for that company anymore. I'm not sure if it was how poorly he handled being lied to (even if we had been lying his behavior was atrocious), or if it was due to having no technical understanding, even at a basic level, of the systems he was supposed to be, well, directing.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: HTTP and FTP are not the same thing.

**$User** \- A manager for a warehouse department. He and I have had some scuffles before. We already don't like each other.  
**$Manager** \- Great guy. More of a ""leader"" than any other superior I've had since.  
&gt;  
&gt;**$CIO** \- A gold standard both for executives in the tech world and for men's facial hair.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on second shift, so I come in at around 10am to see $CIO talking to the gang in the Helpdesk office.  


&gt;$CIO: I've been thinking about this for a while, I don't think we should be letting users into this room. There's a lot of expensive equipment in here, some things are disassembled...It seems like we could avoid a lot of headache this way. What do you think $Manager?

&amp;#x200B;

We hadn't experienced theft yet, but the potential was definitely there (40 iPhones sitting in a row, waiting to get tagged and have MDM ingest confirmed). Also, the number of times that an under-supervised user sat on an exposed motherboard because they assumed our work benches were seats...lets just say that $CIO had a point.  


&gt;$Manager: There will be backlash for sure. What if we tell users they'll only be allowed to enter with a ticket? At that point, I imagine most people would either wait for remote support or ask for a tech to come to them rather than walk, which could decrease foot traffic overall.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;$CIO: Agreed. Lets do that for now and see how it goes. Everyone got that?

&amp;#x200B;

$CIO is 10' out the door when $User approaches. I'm closest to the door, so I meet him:  


&gt;$OP: What's up?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;$User: Let me in, I need a laptop.

&gt;$OP: We've actually implemented a restricted access policy for this room. Lots of sensitive equipment, you know? Do you have a ticket #?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;$User: I need it now. I have things to do.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;$OP: Deploying equipment is something we can't be lenient about tickets for. We need to record who takes what laptop etc. I can show you how to submit a ticket from your phone, it takes 5 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

$User tries to physically push me out of the way to get into the room. He's a good 1' shorter than me, and I've got more than a few pounds on him. It's pretty fruitless.  


&gt;$OP: We don't push here, can we try using our grown up words instead?

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, I kinda egged him on, but the dude deserved it.  


&gt;$User (""Shrieking"" would be a good description of his tone): WHERE DO YOU GET OFF TELLING \*ME\* WHERE I CAN AND CAN'T GO. YOUR BLEEPING DEPARTMENT DOESN'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT WHAT I DO...

&amp;#x200B;

$CIO had walked back to the door at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;$CIO: Need some help $User? I remember telling my guys that they're only to restrict access to their room if you don't have a ticket, like you're supposed to. Did $OP forget that?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;$User (Realizing who he was talking to and how he had been treating me): No...sir, I forgot my ticket and I just need...  
  
&gt;  
&gt;$CIO: Gotcha. Seems like you're being a bit uncooperative. I'll go ahead and call the COO and see how he feels about this incident. Why don't you go back to your desk and put in a ticket?

&amp;#x200B;

$CIO actually did call the COO, and a few minutes later, the COO walks back to our office with $User in tow. I got a nice long apology from $User, detailing why what he did was wrong, explaining why IT is a valuable department, and promising never to shout at anyone at work ever again, which I accepted. The COO thanked me, gave me a ticket number for a request that he had been patiently waiting to get resolved in the meantime, and I walked him into the room and finished it up for him, leaving $User outside to walk of shame it back to his area. IIRC, he never came back for the laptop.

lesethx,Why it is a good and bad thing to give me stickers,"Pro: I found a missing server due to a sticker I randomly placed on it.

Con: I will place stickers all around the office.

------

I rarely get to have a BOFH moment, but this tale gets 2 minor ones.

First off, as the title says, one day I was in our office and randomly placed a sticker onto a server of ours.  It was a generic, black desktop that didnt immediately scream ""I'm a server.""  I think I knew that we used this at clients as a rental of sorts when they needed an emergency server until they ordered a new one.

Sometime later, I took a mini vacation, a 4.5 day weekend, with verbal and email confirmation with both bosses when and where I would be when I get back, specifically $ForProfitClient at 1pm, since it would be a midnight flight coming back.

Cue a call at 10am 

&gt;Boss: Why aren't you are $NonProfitClient?

&gt;Me: This is the first time I am hearing about this, we confirmed, in email, I would be at $ForProfitClient at 1pm.  I havent even checked my email yet.

&gt;Boss: Well we need you at $NonProfitClient.  When can you get there?

&gt;Me: 1pm, as we agreed.

(Note, keep scheduling in writing.)

So the time at the non-profit was a clusterfuck, as all of the cables were messy and looked like the before version of CablePorn (safe link, but story was removed before I think for links).  After some time at the main office, I finally found time to go to the admin office a mile away and check out that site.

Immediately upon setting the network closet, my jaw drops at the messiest of wiring setups I have personally seen (someone actually said ""A cable was unplugged"" for the doorbell, but I was still in shock and stared at him until he went away.  Boss #2 later said she would have replied ""No shit"").

After I started to make sense of closet, I noticed the junk in there.  Mini BOFH #2, I pulled out all the non-IT related items and forced the client to store them elsewhere, including:

*paint cans
*a door
*a dolly

(Picture is... somewhere)

Finally, the Pro part.  Also in the network closet was a non-descript black desktop with a rather unusual sticker on it, which took me all of 10 seconds to realize that was our server I had placed a sticker on a couple months prior.  Without that sticker, I personally could not identify it as ours.

Also in the closet was a large, unopened box, roughly the size of a server, that had been shipped here and stored.

Time to check in with our SysAdmin:

&gt;Me: hey, are we still missing that server?

&gt;SysAdmin: Yeah.  Why?

&gt;Me: I just found it.  At $NonProfitClient.Office.

&gt;SysAdmin: Oh *yeah*!  We loaned that to them while a new server was ordered.  They said they would let us know when it arrived.

&gt;Me: Well, I also see what appears to be that new server here.  Unopened.

&gt;SysAdmin: Damnit, we've been waiting on them for that.  Well, thank you for letting us know.

So as someone who works for a school IT department, i had this lovely exchange with our adorable but flustered exam officer (EO) about an exam submission, that i had recently dropped into one of our subject heads (SHead)

Recently, the exam boards have been enforcing that all submissions are on a password protected USB. The way we've started doing it, is by password-protecting a ZIP file on the USB stick. This required a 3rd party program to encrypt it, as Windows doesn't natively support this functionality.

Enter EO:

EO: Do you have that USB stick with the exam submissions on it. We need to send it off today!  
Me: No, i dropped it into SHeads pigeon hole, and send him an email telling him it was there first thing yesterday. Sorry i didn't CC you in, but i'll forward the email on to you.  
EO: Ok, i'll go find it.  

*EO leaves, and i shake my head at how useless SHead can be...*

*15 minuted later*

EO: I've found it, but me and SHead couldn't get any of the files to open. We can see them, but none open up. It doesn't seem to work!""  
Me: ""I know. It's not meant to. It's in a password protected zip file, as per the exam boards instructions. You'll need a third party program, such as winzip, to open it successfully. If the files opened without the password, it wouldn't be encrypted, and we'd be liable for penalties from the exam board.""  
EO: ""Oh, can you just show me the files open before i submit it then?""

*Proceeds to open the zip file, enter the password which i grabbed from an email both EO and SHead forwarded me, and successfully open a file*

Me: ""See, it's all working exactly as instructed by the exam board.""  
EO: ""Sorry, you know i'm not very good with technology, you and SHead are much better than me at these sort of things!""  
Me: ""I wouldn't say SHead is spectacular either, he didn't even even read the email i sent him yesterday as to the status of the USB stick...""

We made a bit more smalltalk, EO seemed happy that the USB was formatted and encrypted successfully, and i went to type this story up on reddit and start drinking my 3rd coffee in an hour",talesfromtechsupport,683,1556697795

normaldude37,Business brought to its knees by stale pastry,"I had posted one of my two favorite tales from tech support story yesterday.  Here's the other.

  
Same time frame (2003-2004), the company I worked for did the computer work and maintenance for the performing arts theater in town.  It was largely a volunteer staff during the day, made of retired folks who were generally not tech-savvy (relevant later).  So one day, we get a panicked phone call that the ticketing system at the theater is not accepting orders.  I was over there within 15 minutes (it wasn't far), and started in on the problem immediately.  It was not a huge environment, maybe 8 PCs and a server.  


I was still getting to know the system, and it turns out the ticketing client software is only installed on one PC.  So this being the single point of failure, I knew where to look for the problem. It only took me a few seconds to realize there was something wrong with the computer accepting input from the keyboard, particularly the Enter key.  OK, I breathe a sigh of relief.  This will be an easy fix.  All I have to do is swap out the keyboard and I'll have them up and running again, right?  Well, it turns out I didn't even have to do that.  


I then realized that the whole problem was that the enter key wasn't being depressing at all, and that explains why the ticketing software wouldn't accept any entries.  And then I discovered exactly why.  


There was a rather large blueberry muffin crumb that had somehow worked its way under the enter key.  Clearly, someone had been eating a muffin over the keyboard and the crumb had wedged itself in such a way that the key wouldn't press down.  I had mentioned the staff was largely comprised of elderly people and on this day, the person in question manning this computer obviously didn't make the connection that the Enter key was physically not working.  Just that ""the system isn't working.""  


I still have no idea how a crumb manages to fall so perfectly and harden at just the right angle to prevent a key from being pressed down.  So I popped the Enter key off, removing the offending stale pastry piece, and the keyboard works again.  Hooray, they can sell tickets again!  


I take the conundrum crumb into the theater manager's office, show it to her and explain exactly what happened.  Her eyes stare at me in disbelief for a minute before she just sort of sunk her forehead into her hands, shakes her head and mutters ""shit"" quietly.  She looked up at me then and started laughing.  They were able to do business once more, everyone was happy and I was on my way.  


TLDR:  Theater staffed by technology unsavvy retired people can't sell tickets to their shows.  The problem turns out to be the Enter key on the ticketing computer is blocked by a large muffin crumb that prevents the key from being pressed down.",talesfromtechsupport,1041,1556630816

SnArL817,"The Server Rebooted Itself and the Apps Are Down, Maybe A Reboot Will Fix It","I get paged out because our internal ticketing system is down. Offshore admins are stumped. So I log in and discover that the apps aren't running, and the server has only been up for about an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

This system has 2 apps: source code control and the main ticketing system. If you start the ticketing system first, the source code control will not work...it has to be up and running FIRST. Because of this, the applications don't start automagically with the server.

&amp;#x200B;

So I start the source code control app, wait for it to finish initializing, then start the ticketing system. Then I look at the system logs to find out what happened to my server.

&amp;#x200B;

Looks like it crashed YESTERDAY and rebooted itself. Offshore, according to the incident log, rebooted the server again to try and bring the apps up. Now, after source code control being non-functional for 6 months because someone didn't read the documentation thoroughly (me), I put instructions in the MOTD that basically say if the server is rebooted, you need to start source code control BEFORE the ticketing system. I figured that it was pretty clear: you have to start these up manually because the server doesn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Offshore apparently ignored it. In fact, they completely ignored ANY troubleshooting. They didn't even check to see if the apps were UP. Nope, they just rebooted the server, and when the ticketing system didn't start itself up, threw their hands up and paged me out.",talesfromtechsupport,890,1556541842

Clell65619,But it's not Windows,"This is from more than 10 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I work in Teller Machine software.  For reasons I've never really determined, about 5 years prior to my joining the company, the decision was made to use an OS called QNX in our remote servers.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, QNX is a nice little OS based on the Unix Kernel and very much not a Microsoft product.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I was onsite at a fairly major bank in New Mexico installing the code in their brand new servers and just generally doing the setup.  This was unusual.  We didn't normally go on site for this, but this bank, despite being, as I said, 'Fairly Major' did not have an IT department managing their systems and didn't want to hire contractors for this project.  Flying me out for a week and paying for the hotel and meals was cheaper I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

After a tiny bit of hysteria when I was shown their 'Server Room' (a repurposed janitor's closet.  It had a freaking deep sink, with the water still connected in it.  I ducked under the sink and shut off the water) I got the Primary server and associated encryption hardware set up.  So then I go to the CIO (A CIO with no IT department.  Ponder that for a minute) and ask where he wants the backup server.

&amp;#x200B;

In the same closet.  I then spend the next hour trying to get him to understand the concept of 'backup' and finally asked how he was going to run his ATMs at all of his branches (something like 75) if the building we were standing in burned down?  Well, we'd move to the backup, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

The backup in the same server closet as the primary that was destroyed in the fire?

&amp;#x200B;

So, then I was on the road to one of their larger branches and installing the backup and the associated hardware.  I then spend three days training local users to use the machines and help them build a Disaster Recovery plan for switching between the servers.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm all done.  Packing up, getting my final work orders signed off and the CIO comes to me with a copy of some not terribly technical computer magazine and asks if the servers have the latest Service Pack.  It seems he had just read an article about whatever Windows NT Service Pack that was hot then (2007, 2008 ish) and wanted it on his new servers.

&amp;#x200B;

I explained that QNX was not a Microsoft product, it wasn't Windows, it wasn't NT.  It didn't do Service Packs.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I got through to him, and flew home.

&amp;#x200B;

Monday morning I got back into the office, my phone rang and the company president is on the phone asking why I didn't install the service pack.  I explain.

Then the VP who ran my division in the company called to ask why I didn't install the service pack.  I explain.

My manager's boss calls and asked why I didn't install the service pack.  Sensing a bit of Deja Vu, I explain.

My manager came over to my cube and asked me why I DID install a windows service pack.  I explain.  I don't blame my manager, he understood that the OS wasn't from Microsoft and thought the guy over him was confused.

&amp;#x200B;

The discussion worked itself back up the chain, and then back down.

&amp;#x200B;

My manager came to my cube and pulled me off all my projects.  ""They want the service pack,"" he explained.  ""Download the service pack, and upload it to their servers.  Put it in a directory in the root, name the directory Windows Service Pack XX (whatever the number was)

&amp;#x200B;

Downloading the Service Pack was easy enough.  Microsoft used to allow things like that without much fuss.  The company had several nice T-1 lines so I got the 38 meg file in about two minutes.  Unfortunately, we didn't have a data connection to the bank, so the upload was done over a 33.6 Modem.  Twice.  Took like seven hours EACH two full days of my time.

&amp;#x200B;

We decommissioned that bank's stand-alone servers last month when we upgraded them to the latest virtual interface.  The kid I was training was terrified we were in the process of decommissioning the primary server because he found the Windows Service Pack directory in the root and thought we were in the wrong machines.",talesfromtechsupport,1340,1556408899
Clarkthebarista,All the gear but no idea.,"At my organisation, we run a Citrix desktop which for the sake of this post can have two main versions. For simplicity, we refer to them as Red and Green. Green has all of the functionality but can only be accessed using our managed machines. Red looks the same but is a restricted version and won't have various apps with sensitive information. Users can get this when using a personal machine or are outside the network.

If a user is required to work from home as part of their job role, we provide them with a portable device to do this. Herein lies the basis for a phone call I received on the Service Desk.

&amp;#x200B;

Me = Me

User = User

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Good morning, Local Authority's IT Service Desk, Me speaking.

User: Oh, good morning. I'm having trouble accessing an app.

Me: Okay, when you try to access the app do you get any error messages?

User: No, it just isn't on my desktop.

Me: I see, let me take a look at your session.

\*\\ I check the session and realise he is connected to the Red desktop and therefore will not be able to access the app in question /\*

Me: Okay, I can see you're on Red desktop, are you using one of our devices?

User: No, I'm using my own PC.

Me: I see, I'm sorry but if you're using a personal device you will only be able to access Red desktop. For full functionality, you'll need to be using one of our managed devices.

User: So you're saying I just bought this £3000 PC for work and I can't use it?

Me: I'm saying you can access a restricted version of the desktop on your PC but you won't see the Green desktop, yes.

User: Well that's ridiculous! I bought this PC to speed up my workload, it has a great graphics card and is hooked up to 3 monitors which I find very useful! It was very expensive!

\*\\ He actually said that last part. At this stage, my eyes are rolling just wondering what this guy is compensating for. /\*

Me: The device you were given by the organisation is able to be hooked up to your monitors if that helps?

User: It doesn't because the monitors are mounted into the wall, unhooking them will be very complicated! And what about my graphics card?!

Me: The graphics card won't make a difference. You are connecting to a virtual desktop and therefore it doesn't pull resources from the machine, it pulls them from the server. If you feel like the device you have been given doesn't meet your requirements, that's a conversation for your line manager, only accessing the Red desktop on a personal machine is intentional.

User: Well, technically the device does meet the requirements, I just find my PC much more efficient. Using the organisation's device will slow me down considerably!

\*\\ I rarely hear people actively telling me they are bad at their jobs, this is a treat /\*

Me: Again, if your work output is reduced, I'm afraid that's a conversation you'll need to have with your line manager.

&amp;#x200B;

We end the call there after some huffing when the user realises my answer isn't going to change. But wait, there's more, I get a phone call about 20 minutes later.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Good morning, Local Authority's IT Service Desk, Me speaking.

User: Hi there, I spoke to someone a little while ago and they said that I could only get Red desktop when using my PC, was he correct? That doesn't sound right.

Me with a large grin on my face: Yes, indeed he was correct.

icedearth15324,Ever been threatened by a remote employee?,"Well I have. I wish I still had a copy of the email this is about, but I don't, so I'll do my best to remember it. I have to give a little bit of background before I get to the actual email content.  

At my old job I was the help desk manager for one of the colleges for a major state university. We were responsible for supporting all of the faculty and staff for the college which included professors. Also keep in mind we had a central IT that handled the main infrastructure and all of the large-scale systems.  

Around two years ago, we were migrating everyone to Office365 from any of the following: a very very old (30 year old mail server), a newer but still 15 year old mail server, local exchange, and Gmail (if they wanted to). They were also changing it so people could not forward the email to an external address, it was to remain entirely in-house.   

Since professors are not always on campus year round, and some of them were also emeritus (retired but still have the title and affiliation), we had to create an individual ticket where we would reach out and try to get a hold of these faculty members. Sometimes it would take us months to get one of them to reply to us, sometimes we never got responses. Those that didn't reply by the deadline, were forced to migrate, which created an entirely different can of worms.  

Anyway, one day we get a reply to a ticket from an emeritus professor, who lived on the opposite side of the country. The email went a little something like this:  

&gt;Hello, I am an emeritus professor and no longer work in state. According to your email, we &gt;are being forced to switch to Microsoft. My husband used to develop for Microsoft machines &gt;for over 20 years, and if you were closer he would beat you for forcing us to move to them. &gt;There has never and will never be any form of Microsoft software allowed in this house. I &gt;have been forwarding my emails to a local imap account and I have been downloading them.  

&gt;I find it incredibly insulting that you would force someone to use a software without &gt;consulting them. I will be reporting this to our representative and will put in a &gt;recommendation for you to receive disciplinary action for your actions.  

So yeah, I know I'm missing some parts, but either way when I first saw the ticket response, I think my jaw dropped before I just busted out laughing. I sent it to my director, who also laughed, and then we worked on a response.",talesfromtechsupport,775,1556309510

This was a few years ago. A usual working day, telling people not to plug in their phones on the computers, enabling plug ins for people and the like. There are only two of us for this command of 200+ people, so it can get busy. So as I'm going along helping a new guy set up his computer account, I get a call from an E7 telling me that he has some issues with his computer, in that it won't turn on. The other guy is out on another trouble call, so I tell him that as soon as I finish with the new guy, I will head on over. Turns out, that was a big mistake. I proceed to get chewed out, over the phone, about how I am lazy, how the workstations never seem to work, and why did I go to school if I can't even fix the computer right. Then he says one thing that will forever stick in my mind. ""Why don't you do your job for once?"" and hung up on me. So, I apologized to the new guy and had him leave my office and told him to come back in about half an hour to finish up. As I head to the E7s office, one of his juniors catches me in the hallway and tells me that he was sent up there to grab me and make me come and fix it. When I get to the office, he's there, red faced and yelling about how I took too long to come and how he has important emails to send and yada yada. So in natural fashion I ask how long has the issue occurred what were you doing before that happened and such. When I finally take a look at the computer, I notice that it is turned on. When I mention it, he yells "" well why isn't it showing on the screen??"" And, as much as I want to lie, when I looked at the monitor, it was turned off. That's right. The big emergency and yelling, was so I could turn his monitor on. I pushed the button, watched it come on, looked at him and said, ""It's fixed. Please don't push that button again as that turns off the screen."" I walked out, let my supervisor know what happened and had a big, defeated sigh together.",talesfromtechsupport,2157,1556082139
ametueraspirant,error: device ripped straight off it's goddam hinges.,"so this just happened on my shift today and I'm still not over it. I work at a place that supports foreign and domestic grocery stores and I got this call.

{insert opening script}

caller: hi we got a part broken on one of our scos(self check outs)

me: ok can I get the sco type and serial and exactly what and how it's broken?

caller: it's the lid, you know the one with the pin pad and the monitor and stuff on it. it's broken off the front.

now if you've never seen a self checkout door they tend to be pretty big, and very solid. the hinges are metal and there are multiple locks to keep it closed, cause there's money in there. I was needless to say immediately skeptical.

me: alright I'm gonna send this over to the european branch to get someone out there to check it out.

since it was a european store I sent it off and let the guys there know it was coming. we had a bit of a joke about it over IM and I thought that was that.

nope.

about an hour later he sends me back a picture of the thing. turns out it was indeed ripped straight off its hinges. the locking mechanisms are buckled. the hinges are ripped clean apart, and the little air filled stabilizer that keeps it from coming back down on its own when open is bent at a 30 degree angle and leaking some kind of fluid; though still attached and holding things together somewhat. electronics are askew and I swear I could see tinges of dark red prints down either side. this thing doesn't even look like it put up a fight.

ISP HD:  Yeah, we did that.

Me: Ok what is the light status on the device?

ISP HD: I don't have that info, but we did it.

This is when I mute my mic to laugh, because it's just so typical.

Me: I'm sorry sir, you need to tell me what device you are troubleshooting and give me the light status. If it is defective, the tech will not be able to fix that.

I also see the device was purchased from us so we no longer manage it for you. I need the current login info to give to the tech so he assist.

ISP HD: Look the end user is difficult to work with! Can't you just send someone?!

Me: If you can bridge on the end user, I'll be glad to walk them through the process for you.

Yes, OTHER help desk. FML.

Puts me on hold for about 2 minutes and comes back.

ISP HD: Ok, device X was reset yesterday, here is the light status.

It's a miracle. We have the information.
Apparently it was there since yesterday.

Status shows device OK, good physical network connection.

Me: Thank you sir, that's what we need. Everything looks ok with the device, let me check for any network issues.

I pull up the outage board and an outage was going on yesterday in the area but cleared.

Me: Ok sir, there was an outage but the issue was cleared yesterday. There may be another issue going on. Since we can't access the device, we'll need the login info provided. If you can get that for me, I'll send someone out.

Cue excitement and wonder as he places me on hold again. He comes back after a few minutes.

ISP HD: (in defeated tone) Ok thank you for holding. I think the outage was the issue, they've been working since yesterday.

PAUSE

Me: Ok . . . So everything's fine?

ISP HD: Yes. 

But, uh, can you confirm this outage is fully resolved?

Me: Yes it is cleared, but we still have the ticket open.
The outage was related to the local provider, ISP ALPHA.

LONG PAUSE

Me: So we're still waiting on ISP ALPHA to tell us what they fixed before we close the outage ticket.

MORE LONG PAUSE

ISP HD: You can close that ticket.

Me: Ok great. Anything else I can help with?

ISP HD: No.

Me: Ok, thanks for calling ISP, have a great day!

We continue with stories from my trove of mail related incidents. No need to set the scene, let's dive right in:

&gt; **Telephone**: \*rings\*, the number of the front desk is displayed. This normally means one of two things: a) a vendor calls and was able to weasel past the front guard or b) someone with generic enough IT problems has called and they don't know where to put them through.

&gt; **OweH**: University of Y, IT Department, OweH speaking.

&gt; **female Caller**: Yes, hello, I've problems with my mail.

Her voice has this sighing undertone, like all the world is against her. It makes the hairs in my neck stand up in alarm.

I sigh internally, this should have been routed to the first level support.

&gt; **O**: I see. Problems like this are handled by a different group of people, I will redirect your call to them now.

&gt; **C**: You can't help me?

&gt; **O**: As I said, user support is done by our first level support, I will connect you to them.

&gt; **C**: OK.

I forward the call to our first level hotline and get on with my day.

Or at least I try ...

&gt; **Telephone**: \*rings\* with the number of our first level support.

I heavily sigh internally as I am quite sure what this will be about.

&gt; **Support**: I have this lady here and I can't make heads or tails out of the problem. She says she has problems with their mail but can't find here username or her account anywhere. Can you talk to her?

&gt; **O**: OK, OK, hand her back to me. I sense I won't be able to enjoy my coffee until I handled this anyway.

&gt; **S**: Thank you!

\*beep\*boop\*click\*

&gt; **O**: This is OweH speaking again.

&gt; **C**: Hello again, as I already told you and that other person, I have problems with my mail. Can't you fix this?

&gt; **O**: I will try. To analyze the situation I need to know you username or matriculation number.

&gt; **C**: I already told the other person: I don't know. I just get this error when I try to get to my mails.

&gt; **O**: But you need to know your username or matriculation number. Are you a student, a professor or an employee here?

&gt; **C**: Student?

&gt; **O**: If you are a student, then I need your matriculation number to find you in our system.

&gt; **C**: I mean: what student? I have a problem with my mail!

&gt; **O**: I get that, but to identify the problem I need to identify your account and to do that I need your username or preferably your matriculation number.

&gt; **C**: I don't know what that means. I get an error message when going to my mail and your web page says you are currently having problems with AOL and to contact you to get this resolved.

&gt; **O**: AOL? As in America Online?

&gt; **C**: Yes.

&gt; **O**: Hold on, what web page? We are not AOL, we are the University of Y in X.

&gt; **C**: But your web page says to contact you with problems with AOL and I have problems with AOL.

My face must have looked quite puzzling at that moment, because my coworker looks at me in a strange way, furrows her brows and mouths ""What going on?"".

&gt; **O**: Err ... can you please tell me which web page you mean? I need to see this myself.

&gt; **C**: I don't know. *(If I had a € for every time a user voiced those words, I wouldn't need to work anymore.)* I just typed ""AOL mail problem"" into the search and it told me to contact you.

I typed the search terms into my browser window and got nothing. ^(Your typical search bubble in action.) Then I tried the same using incognito mode and lo and behold, the first hit is indeed an article on our web site, describing problem with getting mails to AOL ... from 2005.

&gt; **O**: I see. But this page is from 2005. And this was only related to the mail system of University of Y. This has nothing to do with whatever problem you have.

&gt; **C**: But you have to help me! It's on your web page, you are required by law to help me, because your web page says to contact you to get help! You can't just write stuff on the web and then not help people.

&gt; **O**: Again: You are talking to the IT department of the University of Y in X. **You** need to contact the support for AOL to get help with your AOL account.

&gt; **C**: But your web page says to contact you.

&gt; **O**: Only if you are a student, employee or professor of the University of Y in X. All of which you are not. **You** are a customer of AOL and thus need to contact the **AOL Support** to get help. I can't help you in any way or form.

&gt; **C**: AOL Support?

&gt; **O**: Yes, AOL Support. Because you are a customer of AOL.

&gt; **C**: And they can help me?

&gt; **O**: More than I can.

&gt; **C**: But your web page ...

&gt; **O**: Lady, we are getting nowhere here. Please call the support of AOL.

In the meantime I have opened the administrative interface for our web site and hidden the article in question. This won't remove it from the index of the main search engines but at least AOL lady won't be able to find it anymore when going to our web site.

&gt; **C**: AOL support ... what number should I call? Can you help me?

Normally I would tell her to search for herself, but I want to absolutely and positively get her out of the line without any option for her to try to call me back.

&gt; **O**: Sure, please call 0800-xxx-yyyy and have your account data ready.

&gt; **C**: And they will be able to help me, because your web page ...

&gt; **O**: I am not able to help you. We are the University of Y und X and are **not** affiliated with AOL in any way. Please call the number 0800-xxx-yyyy I gave you to get help. Have a nice day and I hope you get your problem sorted.

\*click\*

I normally don't hang up on people but I needed to get her out of the line, because here voice was creeping me out and I was this \-\&gt;\&lt;\- close to lose my temper with her. 

To put a plug into this, I directly call the frontdesk and tell them to never forward any calls from this person to me or the first level support because I was absolutely sure she'd call back once she was not satisfied with the support from AOL and I don't wanted to be part of that story anymore.

BushcraftHatchet,Can you please turn your machine off?,"Summary - Malfunctioning switch needs to be replaced. Downtime should be about 5 minutes. Asked everyone in our small branch office to shut down their computers. Most of the staff of about 12 turns off their machines and I take care of the other machines for employees that are not there. Well, everyone except Karen.

Karen is the front desk receptionist and walk in sales person that has an active session open to the database. Popping her off the network could lead to her losing the ad that she is working on. She is also talking on the phone. She motions that she needs 1 minute. I motion back not wanting to disturb the phone call and I will give her 5 minutes.

Every one is busy doing manual paperwork and talking on the phone. 5 minutes later she is off of the phone call but says she still needs to finish the ad. ""5 more minutes"", I say as she picks up the ringing phone again.

5 more minutes pass by, I know what port on the network she is plugged into. I start removing patch panel cable to everyone except her, the local server and connection to the WAN. Then I make my way back to Karen.

""I need some more time,"" Karen whines.

""Karen, everyone in the office is waiting on you. So I can do my job and replace a network part, please finish what you are working on and shut down."" I say.

Several employees are now nodding at me in approval as I walk to the back and go ahead and rack up the new switch.

5 minutes have passed for the 3rd time so I make my way back to the front. As nice as I can muster, ""Are you done?""

Karen smiles, ""Nope I just need a few more minutes."" I reach down an unplug her computer's power. ""Thank you,"" I say as I walk away. I went straight to the network cabinet and started to work, while Karen (in a huff) walks to the site manager's office. I let her say what she will while I move the network cables over and fire up the switch. I walk past employees on my way to the manager's office saying, ""You're back up. Please boot up and let me know if there are any problems.""

As I walk past the manager's office, he calls me inside and tell me to shut the door. Karen is slightly crying (clear over reaction). The manager asks me did I unplug her machine and why? I tell him everyone has been waiting on her to shutdown so I could replace the needed equipment. She didn't after I gave her 3 opportunities basically shutting down the entire site for 15 minutes.

""How much longer do you need?"" He asks.

""None, I am already done"" I answer.

He then takes a sigh and then says to Karen, ""The next time he tells you to shutdown you are to do it immediately. Not in five minutes, not after a phone call and not when it is convenient for you. Right then. If this happens again, you will be fired.""

$P: The monitor shows Remote Battery Low.

$B: And when did you last plug the remote into the wall with the included USB charger?

$P: I've never plugged it in. I threw the charger away.

Wut.

Rootman,Ever had a user absolutely refuse to 'turn it off and back on'?,"It's true, usually the first thing out of my mouth for most tech failures is ""turn it off and back on"".

Cue Miss MuckityMuck, a director level user here at BigCompany.  She calls about her laptop not working right.  I suggest she turn it off and back on, simply reboot the thing.  She balks that it's 'an unreasonable request' and to come up with a different solution.  So we fiddle with this, check that, mess with this setting all to no avail.  She refuses to restart her laptop. 'It's unreasonable to think that in this day and age of tech that turning it off and back on again will fix anything! That's simply NOT an acceptable solution!'.  She is determined to find 'someone who can actually  diagnose this situation and give me a 'real' answer'. 

So she escalates the ticket and it goes back into the cue.  Guess who it gets assigned to?  Yep, back to me.  No one else is willing to touch it with a 10' pole.   So I toss it back over the fence to the Help Desk and it sits for a while.  I get contacted about it and explain that she does not want me to help her.  They get pissed and send it to someone else.  

The next tech reads through my copious notes and contacted me.  I tell him flat out it just needs to be rebooted.  He's reluctant to step into a 'lose-lose' situation and begs for me to take it back.  I feel sorry for him so I fall on my sword and take the ticket back.

When I called her back she was surprised to hear my voice.  I again suggest she reboot it and she again refuses.  We talk for a few minutes and finally I guess she softened and agreed to reboot it.  With an SSD, laptops boot pretty damn fast, so it was just a matter of 30 seconds and she was logged back in again.

Guess what? Shazam!  It now worked right.  After a little more small talk to try and placate her, she finally admits that 'it just takes too long to reboot'.  Then she says that it's been MONTHS since she last rebooted.  I guess 30 seconds out of her precious life is just too much.  Despite the fact that we wasted at least 3 hours on all the other attempts.  

She did try and get snarky on the survey from the ticket and my manager called me about it.  After reading my massive amount of notes on the ticket and talking to me he he agreed to set the 'ding' on my record aside, even though she was a director level employee. 

I guess she finally burned too many people, the last I heard she was escorted off the premises one fine morning.  I heard that they threw a party, *after* she left.  Nothing like a grand legacy isn't there?",talesfromtechsupport,821,1555529082
Oricu,"""I get a black box when printing??????""","Are you asking me or telling me? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The body of the ticket read, ""When I use the tool bar my cursor turns into a square instead????????????""

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, there were that many question marks.

&amp;#x200B;

She didn't leave a phone number or a full name.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her to reboot and if that didn't work, to please update the ticket with the following information:

&amp;#x200B;

1) What program she's trying to use.

&amp;#x200B;

2) A direct phone number OR her full name so I could look her up.  Her first name is super common and we have literally 40 people with thatat same first name.

&amp;#x200B;

She reboots, which I can tell as I've been watching the system up time, and updates the ticket with:

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm still getting the box?????????? ph# xxx""

&amp;#x200B;

Great, she answered 0/2 (or 0/3 depending on how you read request #2.). Bonus is that the extension isn't even valid as we use four digit extensions here AND I tried searching AD by phone extensions starting with the three numbers she gave me and got zero results.

&amp;#x200B;

I update the ticket again with, ""Hey, $Name, sorry if I was unclear, but we need you to tell us what the name of the software is that you're trying to use and we need either your full four digit extension, your full phone number, or your first AND last name.""

&amp;#x200B;

She updates, ""I'm trying to use Microsoft. It won't print and I'm getting the black box?????""

&amp;#x200B;

/sigh

What is it with this woman and mashing the ? key like that? What did the ? key ever do to her?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I update again, ""Okay, Microsoft is a software company, but not a piece of software; are you trying to use the Microsoft Office Suite? Microsoft Outlook? Microsoft Word? Or some other piece of Microsoft software. If you look at the icon you click on to open the software it should have the full name, or you can click the Help menu and go to About and it should tell you.

&amp;#x200B;

We also still need either your *four* digit extension, your full phone number or, if you don't know either of these, your full name so we can look you up. We have 40 other people named $FirstName, four of whom are at your location.""

&amp;#x200B;

She updates: ""It's the same Microsoft everyone uses.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OKAY! Let's try a different tactic here: ""What are you trying to print?""

&amp;#x200B;

If she answers something like, ""An e-mail"" or ""a spreadsheet"" or something like that I might be able to figure out what the hell she's talking about--and I can't call her or get into her computer because I don't. know. her. name.

&amp;#x200B;

Her response? ""pdf""

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so, Adobe, not...Microsoft.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we get into the mess of not all of our users use Adobe's software for this; some use third party software and we inexplicably allow this because what are standards?

&amp;#x200B;

I ask her *again* for the name of the software.

&amp;#x200B;

""Microsoft.""

&amp;#x200B;

*Oh, for the love of--*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, I go back to, ""Okay, we'd like to remote in to take a look but, to do that, we need to know your full name so we can find your computer."" (computers are basically named as the username of the person who has them, if I can get her last name, I can find her username, and can find her computer).

&amp;#x200B;

Her response? Just her first name again. The same first name that we have 40+ of.

&amp;#x200B;

""Sorry if I was unclear, we need your FULL name, meaning your first AND last name.""

&amp;#x200B;

*She updates with her just first name again.*

The_Legend_of_Xeno,Possibly a new personal most painful call,"My job is putting Duo two-factor authentication in front of just about everything.  It's going out in front of web mail in the next few days.  My boss gave me some names of people who still hadn't enrolled in Duo yet.  One of them was this woman I've been dealing with for years.  She's as computer illiterate as they come.  I sent her our guide for setting up Duo.  Even though it's only a few steps, and it includes a picture of every step along the way, I knew she wouldn't be able to do it.

I got the first call from her the following day.

Her:  ""So what is it I have to do?""

Me:  ""Did you look at the instructions I sent you?""

Her:  ""No.""

Me:  ""Look at the instructions I sent you.""

She called two more times, but I just sent her to voicemail because I could not deal with it at the time.  I finally picked up after the third call.  She said she was following the guide, but she couldn't get it to work.  I clicked the link to enroll in Duo on my own computer, so I could walk her through it.

I had her go to the link and sign in.  I was having her follow the method that didn't require you to install the Duo app on your phone, since I knew that would be impossible for her.  After she got signed in, I verified that she had already registered her phone number.  Then I had her click the big green button that says ""Call Me.""  She said it still wasn't doing anything.  I heard some music playing in the background.

Me:  ""Is that your phone, or just some music playing?""

Her:  ""That's nothing.""

I asked her to hit ""Call Me"" again.  I hear the same song start to play as before.

Me:  ""Is that your phone?""

Her:  ""Yeah, some 8-6 number keeps calling me.  I don't know who it is.  They've been calling me all day and I just keep cancelling it.""

Me:  ""That's Duo calling to finish the setup...""

Her:  ""OHHHHHH...I didn't know WHO it was...""

Then she started laughing for about 20 seconds straight.  I couldn't even bring myself to do a pity laugh along with her.  I just shut my eyes and squeezed the bridge of my nose in complete silence.  Then she said it was a good thing she had her phone close enough for me to hear it.

*""I always choose a lazy person to do a hard job, because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.""* - Bill Gates (maybe)

Long time lurker, etc.

Background: I don’t actually work in IT, or even IT adjacent, I’m a quality engineer. When it comes to IT, I know enough to get myself in trouble, but am self-aware enough to stay out of it. The company is moving to &lt;Quality Management System&gt; at the behest of a customer. We are looking to implement it for our entire company, because it’s better than what we have today.

Cast of characters:

$EC: elderly colleague, she’s 65yo, is more tech savvy than most her age. Nice lady but talks too much for my liking.

$ITF: IT fellow at our company, I go directly to him for help because he knows how to get shit done, even if it’s not always by the books.

$QMSAI: the quality systems chat “help.” The responses are clearly automated, I hesitate to call it AI, as it doesn't seem intelligent.  

$Me: your friendly neighborhood DeathNote dropper.

It’s 9am on Friday morning, and I’m about halfway into my second cup of coffee for the day when from behind me I hear…

$EC: oh, no. oh ****, ****. 

*$Me (internally): EC normally doesn’t swear, something must really be wrong.*

$Me: EC, what’s up? I don’t think I’ve heard to swear since I started.

$EC: Its &lt;QMS&gt;! When I imported the data, It seems I got the category and individual items backwards. It’s going to take me forever to delete all of these one at a time.

Since we are looking to role out this system for everything, this meant that there are probably 200ish items that are now category headers. The only way to delete the category is to click the trash icon, and then confirm it. Can’t do a select all for categories, only for specific line items. Also, emptying a category does not automatically delete it.

$Me: it’s alright EC. Let me take over, you were doing me a favor getting this set up anyway.

At this point I click the “Chat with support” in the &lt;QMS&gt; UI

$Me: *inputs information, and request*

$QMSAI: thank for contacting &lt;QMS&gt; support. How can I help?

$Me: I need to delete a bunch of categories.

QMSAI proceeds to give me a bunch of useless information about what I’m not trying to do. After some back and forth I finally get it to understand what I’m actually asking. Again, not really intelligent.

$QMSAI: In order to delete the categories… *proceeds to tell me the process I already know*

$Me: I have over 200 categories that need to be deleted. This can’t be done en masse?

$QMSAI: There is currently no functionality to do so. I can request our developers to complete this for you and add the feature at a later date. Turn around time for developer work is 5 business days.

$Me: Thanks

*QMSAI outtro*
 
*$Me (internally): Thanks but no thanks. We don’t have a week to get this configured.*

It’s about 10am now, and I sat back in my chair, thinking about what can be done. As I finished my mug of coffee inspiration struck. it always seems to be at the bottom of a coffee mug. Back in high school my friends and I played a browser RPG (Legend of the Green Dragon or something) that required clicking  various answers to prompts. We used AutoIt to effectively write bots to play for us. I could probably use this to automate this task… I should run this by IT for the ok. I am adding scripting to a work computer after all. I boot up &lt;messenger app&gt; and shoot ITF a note.

$Me: hey, ITF. I need to run something by you. I need to automate a task due to a minor kerfuffle. 

$ITF: hey, Me. Let me stop by your desk and we can talk through it. (translation: no paper trials)

ITF comes by my desk, and I show him the monotony of what needs to be done. 

$Me, hushed: I’m semi-familiar with AutoIt for scripting mouse movements, I want to use it to automate this.

$ITF, hushed: yeah, I’m familiar with AutoIt. Used it before. It doesn’t need to be installed in the system root to run scripts, you can down the zip, unzip it into your documents and it works just the same. You didn’t hear it from me, and you’re responsible for it. Please, for the love of all this holy, write a failsafe in before you accidentally run an endless loop.

$ITF, normal volume: of course, is there anything else I can help with?

$Me: Nope, all good thanks.

I download the latest version of AutoIT. Looked up the syntax again to make sure I knew what I was doing, and quickly wrote a script based on pointer position and pixel color. Thankfully the &lt;QMS&gt; works like excel. When you delete a row, everything else underneath fills in, so the spot to click doesn’t move. I spent up until lunch time writing a basic while script to run if the pixel color it hovered over remains grey. Also wrote it a failsafe hot key in case thing started going off the rails. Tested the script, seems to work great. I them proceed to let it run.

$Me, turning to EC: Hey EC. I got our problem solved.

$EC: yeah? The &lt;QMS&gt; guys can do a mass delete?

$Me: not quite. Just make sure you don’t work in the system until after lunch.

It is at this point she noticed my cursor behind me is moving, but I’m very obviously not moving it.

$EC: wait, how are you doing that?

Me: I talked to IT. They helped me out. Unfortunately, this will lock us out of using &lt;QMS&gt; until it’s done, but will be much faster than doing it ourselves. I recommend we take our lunch while this works.

We went about our merry way for lunch, both of us taking just about our full hour. As I return to my desk, I see my computer is just entering sleep mode. This means a) the script is done or b) there was a minor fuck up and it exited. Thankfully it was a. 

Tl;DR: IT let a non-IT person write a automation script, and it didn't make everything go to hell.",talesfromtechsupport,1999,1555340195
saint_of_thieves,Does your husband fight all your supposed battles?,"Reading about post reminded me of this from my last job about 10 years ago. 

I did on site support for a manufacturing line that made microchips in a clean room. Part of the job was support for end users of their email and Citrix accounts etc. It was one site of many around the world. 

One day corporate decides to send out a phishing email to test the users on whether they click through the link which leads to a page about what phishing is and how they should have clicked on the Report Spam button in their email client. They'd done this before and it would generate a few calls about ""I got this weird email"". No big deal, right?

I worked a 12 hour overnight shift from 1900 - 0700. About 0600 or so, I get a call from some engineer who was just showing up for work. I'd soon find out that his wife worked on my shift out in the clean room. He was mad that his wife had gotten this phishing email and just lit into me. He was telling me how it was stupid and gave me his ideas for what the company should do instead of wasting the employee's (read: his wife's) time. He also says that he'll be taking his grievance to my manager. 

I calmly explained that our office had nothing to do with it, don't know they're coming, etc. As well as the importance of knowing what phishing is in this modern world, blah blah blah. I looked over at my coworker who gives me this ""I can't wait to hear this!"" look.

After getting him off the phone, I took a bit of a breather and sent an email to my manager who wouldn't be in for at least another hour. I hardly ever saw him. I just wanted to warn him that this guy was mad and would be showing up. And also provide my version of events in case engineer guy said something about me. Not that I was worried since our manager was good and went to bat for us before on things. 

When I came back in that night, the day shift informed me that our manager and the engineer had talked. And the engineer had been spoken to by his manager. The engineer had basically been told to leave us alone (we didn't support him, just the manufacturing line).",talesfromtechsupport,1283,1555243443

blindgynaecologist,can I fix this issue on my company intranet by editing stuff in MS Word?,"I’m not tech support, but I work as the only a sales assistant in a pharmacy where all the pharmacists are 20+ years older than me, so I get a lot of “hey, you’re young, what’s wrong with this computer?”

this pharmacy has an intranet/prescription/whatever else program that looks like it was made in Windows XP and hasn’t been updated since. it also has one of the least intuitive user interfaces I’ve seen in a while. 

so a pharmacist (P) calls me over to help with something on the intranet. there’s an old announcement from like a year ago that she was looking at, and now it says the announcement is currently being edited. there’s a big red notification sign, and every time she tries to close out of the program it throws up a warning that there’s an announcement being edited. 

I click around a little trying to figure out how to un-edit the announcement, and we run into our first problem. 

P: I think it has something to do with this document. *clicks on the attachment and downloads readonly.docx*

me: I don’t think so, that’s just a word document. 

P: what if I save the document?

MS Word: this document is read-only, in order to make edits you must save it under another name. 

P: but I don’t want to save it with a different name!

me: look, the problem isn’t with the Word doc, it’s the intra—

P: it says edit here! what if I click it?

me: no, that’s just the MS Word menu—

P: *clicks, doesn’t see anything satisfactory* what if I click document here? 

me: again, just the MS Word menu—

P: I’m so old, I don’t use these Word thingies 

P then has to go help a customer, and meanwhile I look up the intranet instructions, realise she’s accidentally clicked edit on the announcement (the button is right next to download attachment) and closed out without accepting or rejecting the changes, and thus left the announcement as basically a draft, which for some reason goes to live in a separate draft queue and has to be resolved from there instead of just, I dunno, asking the user to accept/reject changes in the announcement window. I fix it and close out of the program. 

once P finishes with the customer, I tell her she’d just accidentally clicked edit and I fixed it. 

P: okay, but show me what you did so I know how to fix it next time. 

me: there shouldn’t be a next time, just don’t click edit on old posts. 

P: no, I’m old, you have to show me, I can’t learn from just listening. 

me: okay, so if you open the announcements—
P: and then you click edit?

me: okay so here’s the layout, when there’s a draft post it’ll show up here—

P: no, I have to do it myself or I don’t understand! I click edit?

me: well not exactly, we’re talking about what happens after you’ve clicked edit, but yeah, click it. 

*editing tab pops up*

P: this never happened last time!

except it definitely did, but okay

P: so then I click to download the attachment?

this has nothing to with the attachment. 

me: no, okay, look—

P: where do I click?

I managed to direct her to the draft queue, then we get to accept or reject changes. 

P: where do I click?

queue several minutes of me explaining the difference between accepting and rejecting changes, which I still don’t think she understands. 

P: oh, I get it, that was easy!

LaHawks,"20 Minutes of ""tier 1"" troubleshooting solved by a Google search","TLDR: read the title

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I work at a medium sized university where our ""tier 1"" support are all student workers. My cube is located in the back office near the phone banks for the students. It's very easy to overhear what kinds of calls they are taking and from time to time I can't help but nudge them in a different direction.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I was looking for something to do when I hear a student worker on the phone with a student having issues with an obscure program the instructor wants them to use. They are getting a weird error. The student proceeds to take 20 minutes trying to troubleshoot the issue.  The saving grace was that he told the student to email in a screen capture of the error.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was looking for something to do, I checked out the error and immediately decided to Google it. First hit was a Stack Exchange forum with everyone saying that the default printer needs to be changed. I checked it out and it looked like something to try.

&amp;#x200B;

Right when the student was ready to give up and just make a ticket (which should have been his first course of action), I walk over and hand him my computer with the SE troubleshooting tips. I'm female and actually younger than some of our students so the look he gave me was pretty funny but he followed the instructions I gave him. After the 2 minutes it took for the student worker to walk through the steps for changing the default printer, everything was working again.

&amp;#x200B;

He seemed thoroughly impressed and I thoroughly enjoyed that. Being a girl and also the youngest full-time tech has made it difficult for the students to come to me with questions because they don't think I know anything.

Last year I was working for a company that hired me to help with network stuff, mostly wireless.

""Hey guys, I know you want to upgrade all the wifi and I get why but I just can not understand why 5G is such a costly upgrade.

Oricu,That's not how wireless works.,"Actual ticket from a corporate director this afternoon: "" Hey the server for $AnOfficeWeClosed is offline and being shipped back to us but I need to get at some of the data on it, can you remote in and turn it on. It has a wireless card."" 

&amp;#x200B;

That's not too bad, all of our stuff is set up to have wake on lan/wlan enabled  in the BIOS so we can poke a server that's off and have it turn on. Not the first time I'd have done that at this place.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem: This particular server is currently in transit back to us so we can pull the data we need to pull then wipe the drive and cannibalize it for parts.

UPS has this server currently.

It is in transit.

&amp;#x200B;

Fair enough that she didn't know that, she doesn't have access to that particular ticket. Our ticketing system is some heavily silo-ed homebrew thing where the left hand quite literally has no access to any indication as to what the right hand is doing.

&amp;#x200B;

I tell her that we can't because the server is currently being shipped back to us and is in possession of UPS (I didn't feel the need to specify that that also meant it was packed up and in a box because, y'know...*obvious*) and it'll have to wait until we receive it before we can get the data for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

In this case, it'll be easiest just to fire the thing up and get it online then she can remote in and get what she needs; I tell her this, and tell her the ETA from UPS is Friday so, at the soonest, we'll have it by late Friday morning.

&amp;#x200B;

She responds to the ticket with, ""I don't understand why you can't remotely turn it on, it has a wireless card!""

&amp;#x200B;

Ok.

&amp;#x200B;

*Kind of* fair, I've had a good number of encounters over the years of people who thought wireless was magic and that you didn't ever have to, say, plug a laptop in to charge the battery because it's \~\*\~\*\~wireless\~\*\~\*\~ and other similar things, not the worst or even dumbest thing I've ever had to explain to someone.

&amp;#x200B;

Without getting too technical on her, because she clearly thinks a wireless network card *is* magic, I explain that we can only do that if the server is, at the very least, plugged in to both power and the network so it can get the ""signal"" from the network to power itself on. Since it is currently packed up and in a box somewhere on a UPS plane or truck, neither of those things are a possibility. Also give her a quick explanation of what a wireless network card can and cannot do and am very clear that it cannot power a server that is in a box at UPS on.

&amp;#x200B;

""But it has WIRELESS, that means you can *WIRELESSLY* use it.""

&amp;#x200B;

I just--it was near the end of my shift, I only have a week and a half left at the place, so I sent an apology for the complaint the IT director would likely get *to* the IT director and closed the ticket with, ""That's not how wireless works; please re-read my previous comment. You'll have to wait until Friday. Do not reopen this ticket, it will not make anyone here be able to magically grant your request before we physically have the server in our possession.""

&amp;#x200B;

She DID reopen it but the director was watching for it at that point and closed it again after a rehash of what I'd said and ended his own comment with, ""I understand this is inconvenient for you, but none of us here ever got a Hogwarts letter, so you'll have to wait until Friday. Have a great evening! Any questions, e-mail me at $HisEmailAddress.""

&amp;#x200B;

NerdyGuyRanting,"""I don't accept that answer"""," 

I work in tech support for an ISP that handles internet, tv and landline phones over DSL and fiber. Last week we had a large disturbance on a huge majority of our tv customers that caused their tv-boxes to display a certain error code. It took a few days before we found what the error was, and fixed it. It only seemed to affect customers from fiber networks owned by third parties, but since it spanned several different companies, we knew the error was somewhere on our part.

When customers called we told them that it was a large problem and that we were working on it, but since we didn't know what the error was yet, we couldn't give them a time frame of when the tv would be back. But after it was solved they were free to call back and we would happily refund them the cost of the tv for the couple of days it was gone.

Most customers were happy with that answer. Several of them are relieved that the problem isn't on their side. New tv-boxes are expensive. But as usual there is always that one \*\*\*\*head that goes against the grain.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

Me: \*Gives the information listed above\*

\*silence\*

Customer: Yeah, I don't accept that answer.

Me: \*slightly confused\* Sorry...?

C: I don't accept that answer. It's bull\*\*\*\*.

Me: I'm afraid that's all the information we have so far.

C: No, it's not. What's the real story?

Me: This is the ""real story"".

C: You can't possibly not know what is causing it. You know. Now spit it out.

Me: We don't know. That's why we are in the process of troubleshooting. Every time someone calls in with the problem, we send their information forward to the department working on it. Every report helps narrow it down and makes it easier to find the error. So if you have any neighbors also experiencing this problem, please tell them to call us, every report helps.

C: No my neighbors have functioning tv because they don't have your \*\*\*\*\*\* company.

Me: I'm sorry you feel that way (I'm really not. He had a really rude tone of voice).

C: You *have* to know what the error is, you are a huge company.

Me: We really don't know. It's working for some customers to it's not a full stop. The only thing we've noticed so far is that those who *are* affected are customers from third party fiber networks. But it doesn't affect all third party customers. We know it's on us thought since it spans several third party companies.

C: I called \[Relevant third party company\] and they said it's fine on their part. So you can't blame this on them.

Me: ... I didn't. As I said earlier, we *know* it's on us. We are working on a solution.

C: So what am I supposed to do now? Just sit here with my thumb up my \*\*\*?

Me: Well... I wouldn't use those words, but yes, for now you need to wait.

C: And yet you expect to keep paying for a service you can't deliver.

(This is a ridiculous thing to say. An error like this will be solved before the week is over, and that customer was billed every third month. It's not like he is going to have to pay a bill while it's not working. And on top that, as I said we are offering refunds.)

Me: Well, earlier I mentioned that you can get a refund if you return once it's fixed.

C: I don't want a \*\*\*\* refund. I want my \*\*\*\*\*\*\* tv working.

Me: \*mute\* sigh \*unmute\* I'm sorry sir. But I can't do that.

C: Then I want to talk to someone who can.

Me: I'm afraid there isn't anyone who can do this.

C: You said it yourself ""*I* can't do that"". You said ""*I*"". So that must mean someone there can do it. Don't try to weasel out of it now.

Me: Okay, then let me rephrase that. \[Company name\] can't get your tv working at the moment.

C: Bull\*\*\*\*. Just connect me over to the guy who can fix this for me. Or at least the guy who knows what the error is and can tell me when it's fixed. Since you are just useless.

Me: \*mute\* Various insults \*unmute\* Like I said earlier, we don't know what the issue is.

C: Well *someone* does! I want to talk to that person. They probably just don't tell you guys because they don't want the customers to know.

(What the \*\*\*\* would the company earn by keeping that info from their customers?)

Me: \*Patience slipping\* Let's say the company did know what was wrong, and didn't tell me. Why would they then tell me the name of someone who *did* know and let me connect customers over to him? We don't know what the issue is. We are working on it. I am afraid that's all the information we have at the moment.

C: So your telling me your company is completely incompetent?

Me: \*not gonna answer that\*

C: You know what, I want to cancel my subscription!

(Gladly, then you are no longer my problem.)

Me: Ok, I'm sorry you feel that way. I'll connect you over to the customer service department, if that's okay with you.

C: \*Probably annoyed that I called his bluff. Hangs up as he is muttering insults and curses.""

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I mean what the \*\*\*\* did the guy expect? Did he think I would go:

""Oh, haha! You got me. We actually just turned off the tv service for all of our customers for fun. This will cost us a lot of money, but it was all worth it.

darth_ravage,That's not going to work. You just need to come out here and fix it.,"A bit of background first: This story happened several years back when I was working in the comm squadron on a large Air Force base. We had several different shops that were very specialized. I was part of the networking shop. We handled switches and basically nothing else. We didn't do anything with routers, cabling, servers, or desktops. That may sound like an easy job, but the base was so big that even just those two things kept us very busy.


So one day I’m going through the tickets in our queue and find a high priority one. The user is claiming that every device in the building had lost its network connection. Strange, Solarwinds was showing the building as up. So I tried logging into the switch and got in just fine. After a quick look at the log, I was pretty sure I knew what the issue was, but I decided to call the user to verify.


&gt;Me: Hi. I’m calling about the ticket that you put in about your building being down? 
&gt;User: Yeah, is it fixed yet?  
&gt;Me: No, that’s why I’m calling. Can you go to the switch and tell me what the lights on the front are doing?  
&gt;User: Isn’t that your job? Why am I doing your job for you?  
&gt;Me: *Oh great. It’s one of those people.* Sir, I’m on the other side of the base from you. It would take me at least half an hour to get there. You are right there and depending on what you find, I may be able to fix this issue for you right now over the phone.  
&gt;User: Ok fine. *User goes to the comm closet.* All of the lights are solid green.


That confirmed what I was expecting. Our base was still using a lot of old model Cisco switches at that time, and they had a tendency to freeze up. Most of the time they would just crash, but sometimes they would keep communicating with the network, but stop passing traffic for everything connected to them. The only sign that anything was wrong (other than everything losing network access) was that all of the lights on the front would go solid green and stop flashing.


The fix was pretty easy: It just needed a restart. Unfortunately, the switch wouldn’t respond to my reload command. Normally in this situation, someone from my shop would just go out there and restart it. We had learned the hard way that if the user found out that it didn’t require any special IT magic to restart a switch, they would restart it every time they had any issue with anything. With these old unstable models, it wouldn’t take long for that to wipe the switch, or kill it completely. It was generally better to spend a few extra minutes driving out there and doing it ourselves then to create a bigger problem down the line. However, this building was about as far away from my shop as it was possible to get. With the size of the base, traffic, and parking, I was looking at about an hour round trip. This was one of those days where tickets were coming in at twice the speed we could handle them and everyone was swamped. Spending an hour restarting a switch didn’t seem like an effective use of my time, so I decided to make an exception.


&gt;Me: Can you restart the switch for me? All you need to do is unplug it then plug it back in.  
&gt;User: That’s not going to work. You just need to come out here and fix it.  
&gt;Me: *Grinding my teeth.* Sir, I’ve encountered this same problem many times. A restart has always fixed it. If a restart doesn’t work, then I will drive out there.  
&gt;User: Fine. *About 60 seconds pass.* Ok. It finished restarting.


I didn’t believe him. These switches were slow at everything they did. A restart would take at least 10 minutes. I ran “Show version” and saw that the switch had an uptime of 6 months.


&gt;Me: Did you unplug the cable all the way?  
&gt;User: Yes! I know what I’m doing.  
&gt;Me: And you saw all of the lights turn blue while it was restarting?  
&gt;User: Yes! Of course they did.


Now I knew he was lying. The lights on that switch couldn’t go blue. This guy was just going to say whatever he thought would get me to go out there and fix it for him. Now I definitely didn’t want to drive out there, but I couldn’t leave an entire building offline just to spite one guy. So I decided to try something else.


&gt;Me: Ok, it looks like I will need to come out there after all. But first, can you tell me what shape the prongs on the power cable going into the switch are? I wouldn’t want to bring the wrong type of connector.  
&gt;User: Uhg, fine. *A few seconds later I was kicked from my ssh session.* They’re flat.  
&gt;Me: Wonderful. I’ll get my tools ready and give you a call before I leave.


About 10 minutes later, I was able to ssh back in and confirm that the system uptime had reset. I gave the customer one last call.


&gt;Me: I just wanted to see if your building is still down before I leave.  
&gt;User: No, it all came back up. I guess we didn’t need you after all.  
&gt;Me: Well I guess I’ll just close your ticket out then. Have a great day.  ",talesfromtechsupport,853,1554714875
draakdorei,What's a Surge Protector?,"I work at a relatively small non-profit company in an accounting position and we recently hired my aunt (who has 30 years in IT for the school district) to replace our former IT guy (15 years with the company). This story is from her and happened this past Wednesday night.

It's a little after five and my CFO (direct manager) and my aunt are the only ones left in the building, as they finish up month end/etc. My CFO walks by the server room, which is a really a storage closet with bad venting and smells something off. He notifies my aunt and they start taking a closer look at the server room together.

The weird smell is our batteries in the UPSs overheating, and one has already begun expanding and melting. Emergency mode kicks in for my aunt and the servers get shut down, UPSs go down and they call in an external IT company that provides our hardware support/replacements.

Batteries get cleared out, still overheating and smelling terribly. External IT arrives and the batteries are replaced. Everything should be good now right? Nope, looking at the servers and the UPSs closer...nothing is on a surge protector of any kind. *Everything* in the server room is using extension cords from the server to the UPS, UPS to the wall. My aunt screamed at that point.

Three hours later, everything is back up and running. The door has been removed and more permanent solutions are being discussed. A surge protector/arrester is now setup between the new larger UPS and the wall. Text alarms and SNMP shutdowns are setup on the servers and UPS, since these were all disabled as well.

Oricu,"""I shut the computer down every single night!""","Whenever a user puts in a ticket about their computer being slow, the first thing I do is check the uptime. Nine times out of ten, there's a system uptime (on Windows 7 at that) of well over 40 days and a reboot clears up all their problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Occasionally, a user argues about this and today was one of those days. 

This particular user was one of our regional directors so not really anyone I could report her to for her completely terrible behavior because the VP that oversees them is just as bad but, whatever, I got a sysadmin job offer from a different company yesterday and am putting in my notice tomorrow so I don't honestly even care at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was explaining to her that we recommend rebooting computers once every 7 days just as a maintenance thing, she interrupts me with, ""No, no, do not even tell me to reboot the computer, I shut it down *every. single. night.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. We also commonly see users who think logging off is rebooting or turning the monitor off is shutting the computer off (and none of the computers are all in ones, so it's not an iMac case where there could be confusion as to the difference between the screen and the computer itself).

&amp;#x200B;

I tell her Windows is reporting an uptime of 41 Days 19 Hours 52 Minutes.

""Well, the computer is lying, because *I LITERALLY shut it down every night!*""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""The computer is still on. If it were off, I'd have been disconnected. I can still move around and open programs. The computer is definitely not shut down.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yes it *is*, the screen is black!""

&amp;#x200B;

""...did you press the button on the monitor?""

&amp;#x200B;

""That's how you shut a computer down, are you new?""

&amp;#x200B;

Ah. No. I'm *not* new. I've been doing jobs like this since 1997.  I've also been in the position at my soon to be former employer for just over a year, so definitely *not* new.

&amp;#x200B;

I try to explain to her the difference between a computer and a monitor and she argues with me for a good five minutes about how I'm wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Different tactic:** ""Okay, well, let's move on; let me walk you through how IT recommends shutting a computer down.""

&amp;#x200B;

She agrees along with a snide comment about how we're always telling them to do things ""incorrectly"" somehow. Whatever. 

&amp;#x200B;

With her watching, I walk her step by step through just rebooting the computer and add in, ""If you want to turn it off, click on Shut Down instead of Restart.""   
Mostly, I didn't want to shut it down because I wasn't *entirely* confident I could convince her to push the power button on the tower to turn it back on and she'd have lost her mind thinking I 'broke' the computer somehow.

&amp;#x200B;

That should be it but, nah, I'm not that lucky today. Instead she *FLIPS* and starts yelling at me about how I broke the computer because Windows went away and now there's this black screen with all kinds of words (just--the POST screen) and how she'd be talking to the IT director and CIO if I ""got her documents deleted"". Mid-freak-out-at-me the computer finishes rebooting and drops her back at the Windows logon screen.

&amp;#x200B;

After she logged in, I showed her the system uptime again, which was now reporting about 3 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh.""

&amp;#x200B;

No apology for being fantastically incorrect or yelling at me about it because why would she want to do that?

And, of course, it was running fine after a reboot.

Zontry_YT,"Second day on tech support, someone tried to sell me on a pyramid scheme","This happened just yesterday, it was my second day on the job and this one lady came over to me asking for the fanciest paper we had. I got her some stock paper and she kept thanking me. I went back to my seat and she called me back and asked me for help printing. 

I had to email her flyer she was printing to my email so I could print it out and she couldn't stop thanking me. She told me ""here have this as a thank you"" it was a powdered energy drink, I said ""no thanks, helping is part of my job"" but she kept insisting so I took it. 

It took a little longer to help than I expected since her computer was older than my dad and she once again said ""Here! Take another packet I've got spares..."" to which I just said oh, thanks? 

This resulted in her handing me her business card saying she's looking for skilled people lmfao. I acted interested in it and she said she'll expect an email from me soon for an interview. 

I finished up helping her and she pulls out a bottle of face wash for me and says it's another product her company makes as a thank you for helping me. I took it and wished her good luck... I looked up her business and it's basically filled with shit like ""doctors are wrong! Try our energy drink to cure your cancer"".

UnfeignedShip,Saving on airfare with SQL Exploits,"Hello all!

&amp;#x200B;

It's your humble IT deity back with another tale as requested.

&amp;#x200B;

This tale takes place when I was with large company with remote offices around the world.  We did game testing and ran call centers.  While some of my most interesting things came out of the game testing, the remote offices were... special.  Some of them were merely on corporate campuses, such as our offices in Microsoft.  

&amp;#x200B;

Others were more remote.  Our Hyderabad office took so long to set up we had a betting pool on when the PM would be making it back.  Others, like our London office, were so random that we strongly considered firing everyone in IT there and just using trained mice.

&amp;#x200B;

Fargo... Fargo, held a special place for all of us though.

&amp;#x200B;

As a general rule, we tried to have as few ""pets"" as possible.  Pets being systems that were extremely unique and requiring lots of attention.  The opposite of that would be herd systems.  If a machine in the herd dies, you just chop up its carcass and spin up another.  You do that with the family dog and people tend to get upset.  (The analogy breaks down here but I trust you get my point.)

&amp;#x200B;

This particular pet was the badge reader system that was nothing like our other standardized systems.

&amp;#x200B;

Every now and then it just needed a good shove.  Facilities saw nothing wrong with this as they had their people there to always reboot the machine.  We in IT felt somewhat differently though.

&amp;#x200B;

The inevitable event happened.

&amp;#x200B;

It wanted a reboot but none of the people there felt comfortable touching the system and no amount of cajoling, pleading, and outright threatening could get anyone to simply push the button.

&amp;#x200B;

It was then I came into the office that day as others had started their shifts around 6AM.

&amp;#x200B;

Your cast:

DJ - DadJoke, an older systems admin but one of my juniors.  A pretty good guy.

G - Genghis, my manager, one of the coolest managers I've ever had and would work for again in a heatbeat.

Me - your humble IT Deity

&amp;#x200B;

DJ - Fargo is down hard with no one able to get in.

G - This is getting a lot of attention, we might have to send someone out there.

Me - Did anyone look to see if there's iLO or something like that we can use to just bounce the box?

DJ - Nope, this is running on just a desktop with a cheap UPS, not a managed PDU.

G - u/unfeignedship you up for a quick trip.

Me - Seattle to Fargo isn't a quick trip... you're not still pissed about when I said you had a Cmdr Riker haircut are you...

G - Nah, your pay cut made up for that.  But if we can't get people in the office they can't do payroll which would be a big deal and we incur fees every time we call the office management to unlock the door.

Me - Did anyone scan the box from the utility box on-site to see if there's anything we can do?

DJ - RPC crashed, so no RDP.

Me - Yes, but did you scan it?

G - We can check if remote desktop is working...

&amp;#x200B;

I quickly drop nmap on the utility box and see that it's running Windows 2000 and even better an older version of SQL 2005.

Prior to SQL 2005 SP4 there was an extended procedure called *xp\_cmdshell* that was one of the easiest ways to compromise a server running SQL.  It allowed you to execute command line tasks in the context that SQL server was running.  So if it was running as System, then you could add users to the machine or all sorts of nastiness.

&amp;#x200B;

I quickly check if we have the sa account for this box and we do.

&amp;#x200B;

Ten minutes later...

*EXEC master..xp\_cmdshell 'shutdown -t0 -r -f'*

&amp;#x200B;

Me - I just rebooted the server.

DJ/G - How?!

&amp;#x200B;

And that's how I used a SQL vulnerability to save a long and boring flight.

ME: Standard phone greeting

Exec: Every now and then when I want to get into my email or calendar I get this broken-ass bullshit that looks different, doesn’t have all my mailboxes and is just generally a hassle to use.

ME: I’ll be right over… (The walk to their wing often gives us time to get our thoughts collected and plan an approach to the reported problem, but I honestly didn’t have a clue what might be going on.)

ME: Hi Exec, would you show me what’s happening?

Exec: Launches the shortcut: Damn, there it is – that’s just about completely useless to me.

Exec: Please tell me this hasn’t been a case of me being special all along, I thought those were the same thing… let me check it.

	Checks and of course, the identical shortcuts launch their associated OWA or Outlook.

Exec: Well for fuck sake! Please get rid of the bad shortcut and wait a minute…

p0ddie,electrician killing off the entire network - twice,"So you'd guess the electrician provoked a power surge or something, right? Far from it.

I worked as a subcontractor for a company providing IT services for medical practices. In this quite large practice (cardiologists, 5 doctors, 3 ultrasound rooms...) they use a Windows workgroup without AD because their ancient patient administration software (a product that leads the market in my country and it's a first world country…) can't handle a modern network. 

They also have a relatively slow internet uplink.

Some years ago the electrician who also likes to dabble in IT just swapped out the professional vpn router for an all-in-one router you usually use at home. One of the boss doctors agreed on him doing it, someone suggested it in the first place, we as IT were neither involved nor informed.

What happened is what was to be expected: New router installed with different MAC ID, all the Windows machines' firewalls and the server detected a ""new public network"", switched to closed clamshell mode and *not a single* machnine worked. Then they cried for help and started pointing out the reaction times in the contract we have with them as in ""you better fix what you fucked up"". This was some 3 years ago, there were numerous other incidents of people doing IT things there without informing us as their IT services provider obligated by contract to fix their stuff in a time frame if something goes wrong.

Guess what: The exact same electrician did the exact thing AGAIN!!! Swapped out the existing vpn router for a different device as someone let him do the transition from ISDN to VOIP and they needed a new router for that - and the entire network did go down again because of the different router. What an idiot.

The funny thing is: The contract with this medical practice was cancelled a couple of days before because we had enough of their shenanigans.

I pointed their new IT guy in the right direction of course and he fixed it.

Good luck fixing your electrician's crap in the future, you curmudgeons.",talesfromtechsupport,1699,1554106891
bigjilm123,A little indexing goes a long way,"I’ve got a million of these stories. Someone stop me if they get annoying...

For those that remember my “Where did Dave go?” story, you may recall that I had several SQL Server clusters from hell. The most fragile, finicky and difficult to support pieces of garbage I’ve ever seen. Being supported by a matrixed team doesn’t help, and that’s where the DBA team comes in.

Boss: Cluster 1 is running hot.  We want to scale up the app by 100% three months from now. Can we do it?

Me: Yes.  The performance of that cluster is fucking terrible and I’m sure we can solve that problem in three months. 

We bring in MS Titanium Premier support (or whatever it was called - big bucks for on site experts).  We bring in our datacenter’s best hardware consultants.  We bring in the dev team, the business owners, and finally the DBA team.

Me: That cluster is performing terribly. It often pegs the CPU.  The RAM is maxed out.  The disk access is running extremely hot.  The actual load on the DB is really light though - very few users and a reasonable database size. 

Everyone:  Agreed, but we think it’s because of some other team &lt;finger pointing ensues&gt;.

I quickly realize that me and the dev team will have to solve it, so we spend the next few weeks checking the most obvious things. We are hampered because we can’t actually touch production, so we have to keep asking for config to be pulled and profilers to be run. 

Meanwhile, all of these experts are recommending the stupidest shit.

MS: Tweak this setting, trust us.  &lt;complete production outage ensues&gt;

Hardware guys: Raise a request for new servers. The new ones are almost 5% faster.

DBAs:  Can we move the app to the mainframe DB2?

We get a profiler trace that shows that the query that is executing the most often is running poorly. The trace doesn’t have enough logging to pinpoint the problem, but it’s a good place to start.

SELECT &lt;col1, col2...&gt; FROM tblX where id&gt;blah order by dateY

Me:  DBAs, can you confirm that there’s an index on id, and on dateY in production?

DBAs:  Yes, of course there is. Let’s tweak the fuck out of the RAM settings instead!  &lt;complete production outage&gt;

A couple months go by, and one of the devs comes to me and says, “There’s no way those indexes exist.  It’s tablescanning for sure.”

Me:  DBAs, please pull a list of indexes from production again.

The list arrives, the indexes are there, so another dead end. 

Two weeks before scaling...

Boss:  BigJilm, what do you need to make this happen?  This is too important to miss the deadline. 

Me:  I need Admin access to the cluster for two hours. 

Boss:  Done - midnight to 2 am tonight. 

We amass an army of people for an overnight session, probably 30 people that have been involved and who want to check on their suspicions real-time. The DBAs are there, my devs, hardware, network, business...

12:05, Me:  Let’s quickly run profiler in that select statement with logging cranked up.

12:06, Me:  Why is it tablescanning?

12:07, Me:  Why are there no indexes on that table?

This is after 10 weeks of full time troubleshooting. I’m fucking furious. Everyone on the call is quiet.

Next morning, two new indexes in place, and the cluster is running at about 1% everything. 

Me: DBAs, why did that report show all of those indexes two months ago?

DBAs:  That report was from Dev.  We aren’t allowed to check Prod.

bigjilm123,Where did Dave go?,"About a decade ago, my ex-company outsourced all of its infrastructure to one of the big datacenter companies, so while we would still support our apps, the OS, hardware and networking are all supported by this other company.  Most people in this story are great people, but you occasionally run into an idiot, and we will call this one Dave and he worked in the datacenter.

I supported an app that used SQL Server clusters which were really hard to support - so many things could go wrong with them, and they were really hard to diagnose.  We were on first names basis with the crew in the DC because we had support bridges going all the time.  When Dave was on the bridge, he’d be angry, indignant, overly confident and eventually refuse to troubleshoot.  Keep in mind that a good 90% of the failures were things that he’d have to fix, but it would take hours to convince him that our app hadn’t caused it.

One day, our cluster had been offline for something like 48 hours straight, and everyone is losing their minds.  Dave shows up...

Dave:  I just heard that Microsoft is trying to blame the NIC, but I’m telling you that it’s absolutely a bug in their product and I’m not going to troubleshoot the NIC or any other hardware.  

Me:  Its been running just fine for three years.  The NIC is throwing errors and the network guys agree it’s likely the cause.  Can you try swapping it out?  We’ve already gotten the swap approved and it’s in your queue.

Dave:  No.

Dave’s boss is on the call, and probably his boss’ boss too.  Everyone is quiet, waiting to see what’s going to happen.

Dave:  I need to check something.  I will be back in 20 minutes.

45 minutes goes by and Dave calls back in from his cellphone.

Dave:  Sorry for the delay.  My badge stopped working and I couldn’t get back to my desk.

Dave’s Boss:  My apologies everyone.  We are going to close down this bridge and re-open a new one.  Check your emails. &lt;beep&gt;

We find out later that Dave had gone outside for a smoke break and they disabled his badge.  He got a phone call after the bridge shutdown telling him he’s fuckin fired.  Probably the only person I know to get sacked during an incident bridge real-time.

Remo_253,"The easiest ""Emergency"" I've ever had","TL:DR at the bottom.

I'm retired but used to do tech support for a main frame billing program. Now I do PC tech support as a hobby. I have a dozen or so clients, some paying, some Pro Bono. This includes one small business. I've always avoided businesses because this is a hobby, not a job, but I was asked to do it as a favor to someone.

I was over there recently checking on an issue and the machine that gets the most usage was just crawling. Click on something, sit back and wait. It was Windows 7 on an ancient piece of hardware so I suggested they upgrade. Windows 7 is reaching EOL so they'd get Windows 10 and a modern machine. A twofer.

They took my advice and I spent some time moving all their files, reinstalling their programs and making it look as much like the old machine as possible. This included configuring a newer version of Outlook and moving over the PST files. I delivered it yesterday, confirmed everything was working, including the email.

This morning the first thing in my inbox was from their secretary, ""Help!! All of the email settings, addresses and important archived emails are gone! Can we recover them?""

What the hell? I know it was working yesterday. So I went over there, sat down at the machine, with the secretary standing behind me, and clicked on the Outlook icon on the taskbar. It opens and everything is there.

Secretary: Oh, it's that one (pointing to the Outlook icon)? 

Windows of course had installed, and put on the taskbar, it's ""Mail"" app. That's what she was opening. In her defense the new version of Outlook had a different icon than she was used to and as she moved the cursor along the taskbar she hit MS's app first, which says ""Mail"".

TL:DR New machine, moved from Win 7 to 10, secretary panics because all her old emails are gone, can't get new ones, etc. She was opening MS's Mail app instead of the new version of Outlook, which had everything she thought was missing. ""Oh, it's that icon?""",talesfromtechsupport,819,1553968777
Gloopicalis,"Oh, but he didn't stop there.","Long time lurker, first time poster.

Both me and my partner work in IT of some kind, he's in a fairly high-level helpdesk type role (3rd line, project design and implementation) and I'm a product manager at a fairly small company so will regularly muck in with the helpdesk to get a mood level or if it's priority one/needs diplomacy. We'll often trade horror stories from our day while making dinner.

This one is from a bit over a year back, when he was working in the IT department of a mid-sized company. It spans a couple of countries but each one tends to handle their own IT needs except where crossover is required. Sorry, it's a second hand story so it's pretty narrative.

Consultant comes in to look over IT security policies in line with incoming GDPR regulations. Their findings were pretty good, not a lot of changes needed, but they recommended putting in a tighter timeout to lock machines after inactivity (company held a fair amount of customer data which falls under the personal category and not all departments were allowed to access). It gets set to five minutes - arguably annoying, but enough time to visit the bathroom or get a coffee without it locking.

Call comes into the helpdesk, coworker picks up. It's a user in the category of ""known to us"", our shorthand for ""oh no, not you"". If memory serves, he's someone in marketing. User is asking if they can disable the lockout time on his account. Response is no, it's a global setting, they can't do it for one person. User gets to shouting about how this is the biggest injustice of all time and the coworker is terrible etc. There's a zero tolerance of abuse to IT in the company, at which point the helpdesk can just hang up. So he does. Partner heard everything and made a mental note 

Two minutes later, phone rings, my partner answers. The user is back, obviously trying his luck to see if he'll get a different response from someone else. But no, no different response. Partner goes on to say it's a GDPR thing and explains why it's good practice, in the hopes he'll understand. Ah, so naive. Same tirade, same end result of hanging up.

At this point partner decides it's wise to give a heads up to the run team manager that this guy is likely going to call and complain. It happens literally while he's telling him. He dives immediately into shouting (and I think tries to persuade him to fire the helpdesk). Manager tells him the same thing, and adds on that the abuse being directed at his team will need reporting to user's manager. User swears and hangs up. Manager gives a heads up to user's manager (""oh no, he's doing what now? I'll talk with him. Sorry."") 

Oh, but he didn't stop there.

Next day it's business as usual, until the head of IT walks in with a look of disbelief. User tried to escalate to him. (This guy is in charge of all IT and development in the country for this company, best estimate about twenty people.) Same story in terms of his attitude, same response given. Once everyone relays their own tales, they all have a laugh about it and carry on.

Oh, but he didn't stop there.

Later on in the day, head of IT comes back to update them. User walked straight into the office for the Director of Operations and tried to convince him in person that this was a huge injustice. 

A reminder at this point. It's a machine lockout. That can be got past by just entering your password again. That is all. Nothing more. Nothing less. 

The Director of Operations had zero context of any of the previous happenings and relayed to head of IT. Who I can imagine just laid his head on his desk, told him the story and said he would handle. User's manager told again at this point, who was livid.

OH NO... BUT HE DIDN'T STOP THERE.

All was quiet for about a week. No further complaints. Peace restored (at least as much is possible on the helpdesk).

All of a sudden, run team manager starts absolutely wetting himself laughing. Gets off the phone and updates the team.

The personal assistant to the owner of the company (by the way, based in another country - we've gone international, folks) emailed the head of IT, who relayed to run team manager. User sent a HAND-WRITTEN LETTER to the honest to god owner of the company to complain about the five minute timeout. Luckily, the PA screens all his physical mail. It was apparently filled with profanity and insults directed at basically everyone.

Don't think user was fired, but honestly, I don't know how, and it's possible he's now gone. 

(Oh, and for the record, he did stop there.)

TLDR: user escalates displeasure with machine lockout policy to owner of company with ~5k employees.",talesfromtechsupport,994,1553942232

One project was capturing a ton of data related to the core business and then feeding an AI engine to produce a report. I got to run the data entry team, then build the AI algorithm and then finally build the report. It was a million data points, and it produced a one page summary of the algorithm’s output.

igono,I know you deleted my files!,"This happened a few years ago so parts of the conversations I am going off memory. This whole thing went on over a few week period.

&amp;nbsp;



$DU = Dumb User

$ME = Myself

&amp;nbsp;

Sitting at my desk first thing in the morning when I start looking though the ticket queue to see what I could knock out quickly before I was going to be in meetings for a few hours. First thing I see is a file restore ticket so I grab that one so I can just kick it off, but then I notice in the ticket the user wanted me to call them, because they needed to speak to someone about their disappearing files.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; $DU: ""Hello this is $DU.""

&gt; $ME: ""Hello, I got your ticket you submitted this morning for a file restore, and you requested a phone call about it""

&gt; $DU: ""I need y'all to stop deleting my files. It is preventing me from doing my job.""

&gt; $ME: ""I'm sorry sir to hear your files keep come up missing, but we do not delete any files.""

&amp;nbsp;

That statement was mostly true, many years before we migrated from Novell file servers to Windows file servers we had some servers that were at their max volume size, but of course so many apps the business used at that time were in house developed apps were hard coded to use specific file paths. Also the developers had no care to fix any of this, because they had ""no time"". So we would go out and delete files that were not allowed to be on there the users still stored (music, movies, personal photos, etc...) We never deleted anything work related. Also $DU started within the last few months so should have no idea that even happened back then.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; $DU: ""Yes you do I know you do.""

&gt; $ME: ""Sir, the files are in the process of being restored, but I will check with my team to see what I can find. I would recommenced to you that you check with your coworkers to make sure none of the deleted by mistake.""

&gt; $DU: ""Whatever"" and he hangs up

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward later that week, and I see a ticket in the queue for restoring the same files. This time I do the restore, email the user it is restored and resolved the ticket. Then my phone starts ringing

&amp;nbsp;


&gt; $ME: ""Hello, this is Igonox, how can I help you.""

&gt; $DU: ""Why did you delete my files again! You need to stop this I cannot get my work done!""

&gt; $ME: ""Sir I checked with my team and no one here deleted any files on that file server.""

&gt; $DU: ""I told you I know y'all delete files all the time. You make it impossible to do our jobs!""

&gt; $ME: ""I will forward your concerns to my manager, and he should be giving you a call.""

&amp;nbsp;

$DU hangs up without a response to that. I shoot an email off to my manager with all the information, and then I start to get back to work. To try to prevent anymore calls from $DU I hop on that file server and enable auditing for file deletion so next time I can see who is doing it so we can put a stop to it. A few weeks go by and then finally get a ticket again. So I pull up the logs to see who deleted them and logs show they were deleted a few minutes before the ticket was submitted by $DU. I send the logs off to my manager who then contacts $DU manager. I found out after that call for weeks $DU had been missing deadlines for his work, and he kept blaming IT. Turns out $DU was in over his head with the job he was hired to do. He must of figured he could get away with blaming IT when his work was late. I never saw a ticket from him after that day.",talesfromtechsupport,1989,1553837444
mrcpu,How dare you put ME on hold!!!!,"This happened last week and it really burned my biscuits.  I ruminated on it all weekend to be frank.  


I won't get into all the details but I had a user who is a manager call in with issues around her email client acting up.  As I listened to her description of the issue I poked around the network and saw some strange stuff.   Then all of a sudden my phone started ringing off the hook with multiple calls including one from her location.  


I said something along the lines of  ""Please hold for a second, I'm going to grab a call from someone else at your location"".  I was on the other call for all of 30 seconds and was able to get further information relevant to the original caller's issue.  It confirmed that there was some sort of network outage happening.  By this point the original user had hung up.  I tried to call her back but she had called from a phone that wasn't assigned to anyone (so it could make internal calls but didn't have an extension).  I got the other person at her office on the phone and asked her to get my original caller to call me back and then I proceeded to go talk to some of the other guys and find out what was going on and when it would be resolved.  


My original caller called me back and launched into a tirade:  ""HOW DARE YOU PUT ME ON HOLD!"" was the basic idea of what she said.  She ranted for a good 2 minutes and I just sat there listening in stunned silence.  When she finally stopped talking I could tell she was waiting for an apology.  I just said something like ""Ok, well we are having a major network outage and that's what caused your issues.  Is there anything else?""  I swear I could hear her sputter and blood vessels popping as I said goodbye and hung up to continue to answer the phone as it rang off the hook for the next couple of minutes until the issue was resolved.  


I still can't get over the sense of entitlement that somehow she is too special to be put on hold!   I almost never put someone on hold and I sure as heck don't do it so I can go help someone else.  The entire purpose of my taking the other call was to see if my hunch was right and that it was not actually the original caller's problem.  


In the future I'll just sit there with the caller and spin my wheels unable to actually help her while I watch and listen as the network burns down around me, you know, so her feelings of entitlement aren't hurt!!!

She goes to the computer, says she can see the desktop now, tells me everything is working, that I can close the ticket, and hangs up.

&amp;#x200B;

***The “everything is working” and “you can close the ticket” parts are key here.***

&amp;#x200B;

Two hours later, she reopens the ticket with, “Computer is off again, please call.”

While I’m waiting for her to pick up, I check again. The computer is not off, it’s on, and it’s at the desktop.

**Me:** “Hey, $Name, so I checked and the computer isn’t off. It’s at the desktop. Are you not able to see anything on the screen?”

**Her:** “Let me look.” A pause, then, “Oh, never mind, it’s working again, you can close the ticket, thanks!”

And she hangs up. I close the ticket again.

&amp;#x200B;

Two hours later, she reopens it with, “Computer is off AGAIN. Please fix.”

I check, the computer is, once again, not off. This time, I check the power saving settings and disable the “Turn monitor off after 2 hours” option thinking this is what’s happening because she’s reopening the ticket at a 2 hour interval instead of just—moving the mouse to wake it up. That’s about the only power saving option we ever have turned on by default as some of our legacy software that a lot of sites still need to use for account references loses its entire mind if USB ports or, worse, the hard drive or the OS itself go to sleep; you end up having to exit the old, terrible software entirely and relaunch, which is…a process…so we just stop that from happening by shipping everything with all power saving options (apart from the 2 hour monitor shut off) disabled.

&amp;#x200B;

I call her, I let her know what I changed and have her go look again. She does, and tells me, once again, that everything is working fine again, and I can close the ticket. I ask her if she’s sure, does she maybe want to open a couple of programs and make sure they’re all working because, just because I can move around on the remote session always doesn’t mean I can tell if it’s working right from her end.

She tells me she’s *absolutely sure* it’s working fine, and I can close the ticket.

I close the ticket.

&amp;#x200B;

Two. Hours. Later. “Computer is off yet again. I thought you said you fixed it.”

&amp;#x200B;

This time, I was on another call but I could still check and, once again, it’s not off and it’s not asleep, so I updated the ticket (which sends an e-mail notification to the person who submitted it) with, “The computer is not off or asleep. All power saving options are disabled, it is not possible for the computer to go to sleep or for the monitor to be put to sleep by Windows. It is possible that the monitor has built in power saving options that are putting it into standby; if you let me know the make and model of the monitor I can look up what it has for settings and give you instructions on how to disable any power saving features it might have.”

She updates the ticket with, “Sorry, I meant to say the mouse and keyboard aren’t working. I tried changing the batteries this morning, and unplugged the USB receiver and plugged it back in, but it didn’t help. I haven’t been able to use the computer all day because of it.”

Out of sheer curiosity, I asked her why she didn’t mention that six hours ago and why she told me everything was working when it clearly was not, and got, “I thought you’d just tell me I had to replace the mouse and keyboard if I told you that was the problem and I didn’t want to have to run to Best Buy and get one.”

Uh.

*Well.*

**Yeah, that’s what I would have told you because that’s what the problem was.**",talesfromtechsupport,1523,1553655181
Adamrdcp,"Boss, I think the server room is on fire!","Just found this sub, this story will probably fit here.


So I work at an I.T. Firm. We have a lot of customers, ranging from tax services to HVAC companies, so we get a wide variety of strange phone calls, but this is by far the most absurd phone call I have overheard. 


My boss and I were driving back to the office after having installed some new hardware for one of our customers. On the way, his phone rings and this is the conversation I overhear:


Customer’s In-house I.T. staff: ”(Boss name), I think one of our servers is on fire!” She sounds very frantic over the phone, my boss calms her down and lets her know that we’ll be over as soon as possible.


We rush over, and sure enough the first thing we smell when entering the building is burnt electronics. As we enter, I jokingly say “Not to worry, the fire brigade is here!”, then we ran upstairs to see what had happened. They hadn’t evacuated the building yet, and funnily enough no one seemed to be too concerned about the whole situation.


We entered the server room and immediately we knew what was wrong. One of our old UPSs had died and was pretty close to thermal runaway (thank god that didn’t happen), after following us in, their I.T. staff simply said this:


“Oh, I thought that flickering orange light was a flame.” They were referring to the blinking light on the back of one of the server’s NICs!


Anyway this story doesn’t end with anything more interesting than that, but when we disassembled the old UPS, holy crap was it bad. The internal battery was just bulging like you wouldn’t believe. It really was about to explode, but luckily the server “caught fire” and we were able to remove it.

The_Only_Unused_Name,Meth. Not even once.,"As I've pointed out in prior tales, I provide support for a hospital. 

I got called down to the ER about two hours ago, because one of their shiny new COWs (Computer on wheels) was having problems staying connected to their shiny new EMR (Electronic Medical Record). Curiously, the workstation was not losing it's connection to anything else, just momentarily dropping it's connection to the EMR. The EMR itself is hosted offsite. Their preferred method of connection (dig this crap) is to connect to their server via RDP. Yeah, it sucks. For it to work we had to NAT a series of addresses for each machine, which was statically assigned. It is very finicky and has to be logged into and out of a certain way, as it's well... poorly made. 

But none of that even remotely matters, because when I got to the ER...

The nurse called me over to one of the rooms. ""It just happened!"" I go in to take a cursory glance and come across a patient, in her nightgown, writhing on her ER bed. She might be 25, but she has the look of a 40 year old weathered saddlebag. Writhing may not be the word I'm looking for. Twitching, perhaps. And chewing on invisible food. And dancing on her bed to inaudible music. 

Ah, meth, you silly rascal, it's 8:30 AM. Never too early for a little bump, am I right?

Her companion, a gaunt, nearly-skeletal man in dirty jeans and what was probably once a nice shirt, is sitting next to her, in a similar state of jankiness, eyes darting wildly, tonguing some kind of invisible candy.

The nurse and I roll the ailing COW out of the room and close the curtain and the sliding glass door.

Funny thing about curtains. They're just opaque enough to block your sight, but just transparent enough to allow you to see the silhouette of someone on the other side. In this particular case, as soon as we left the room, we got the privilege of seeing two silhouettes engaging in some rowdy, drug-fueled, hospital bed sex.

Oh, meth, don't you go changing.

Shaken, but undeterred, I herd the COW back to the nurses station and begin some diagnostic stuff which I won't bore you with because honestly, the sideshow was so much more entertaining.

After a few minutes, the fellow emerged from his friend's room, buttoning his pants. He sauntered over to the linen cart, grabbed a few towels and sheets, and simply walked out of the door. Yeah, that's right. He stole hospital towels. These things barely qualify as towels to begin with, but, there you go. Within a few more minutes, he was back, strolling in with all of the smoothness of a shopping cart with a broken wheel, and herky-jerked his way back into her room for round two. He didn't manage to close the sliding door all the way, so this time we were granted an audible addition to the show. Truly entertaining.

I've now gotten the problem narrowed down to the WiFi driver, and began doing the work to fix it. In the meantime, round two has subsided, and the fella pops back out, raids the linen cart a second time, and disappears out of the waiting room door and into the morning sun. Why does he need so many crappy towels? The people need to know.

At this point, the nursing staff moves the linen cart into the locked med room behind the nurses' station, as well as anything else this fellow can steal out of, and notifies the local police of what's going on. Before the authorities can arrive, however, he's back again. He ambles around, asking, ""Hey, man, the bathroom. Is there a bathroom, Gotta use the bathroom,"" like Rain Man demanding to watch Judge Wapner.

He is pointed in the direction of the public restroom, wherein he stays for just a few moments, before walking out with an armload of toilet paper.

The computer doesn't exist anymore. This unfolding drama is my world now.

Just in time, Johnny Law comes in, takes a short statement from the staff, and then exits the ER to find Romeo himself strolling back in. One short conversation later, he's spread over the front of their cruiser, a substantial baggie of crystal meth and a crappy, now broken glass pipe laying on the hood next to him, as they pull his hands behind his back to receive his new steel bracelets. He gets tossed unceremoniously into the back of the car, a situation we are informed later that he is very well acquainted with. He also receives an all-expenses paid trip to the pokey.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the other principal players in this little show- 

&amp;#x200B;

The lady friend, as of my knowledge, is still back in the ER, likely dosed up on Ativan or something, heck I don't know, I fix computers, not people.

The computer is working fine.

The nurse is completely unphased. When I asked, she said ""Same crap as always"". 

The linens and toilet paper are still unaccounted for, the greatest heist since D. B. Cooper jumped out of that plane.

I'm still questioning the life choices that led me here.

robbdire,No wifi? No really.,"A short one, but should be fairly obvious.

Reply-all.

"" Hello Teacher,

I'll take a look at it when I am in.

So I get in nice and early, before classes start, as I always do, as I like to get as many issues resolved before the teachers need their classroom.

Go up to this room, sit down at the computer, power it on, indeed no logon servers.

Now all these machines are connected via wifi, even the desktops. I go and check all the ports, and sure enough the tiny little usb wifi dongle is missing, and instead there is an Apple charger cable (because it's always iPhone users) plugged in.

I find the wifi dongle on the floor beside the case. I remove charging cable, plug in dongle, and reply-all.

""Hello Teacher,

The issue is now resolved. The cause was someone had unplugged the wifi dongle and plugged in a usb charging cable for an iPhone. As I am sure you are aware the computer needs the wifi dongle to connect to the network.

I've removed the cable as you are no doubt aware that connecting iPhones to school property is prohibited.

Regards
robbdire"".

Brother_Primus,Note to self: Make error codes less vague,"Alongside my day job as an admin, and my weekend job as a consultant, I dabble in a bit of custom software for my clients if required. It's mostly pretty simple C# apps to fill a simple requirement. For one client I was building a piece of software that would act as a front end for a web app, nothing too fancy and not a lot that could go wrong with it. 

While trying to sort out an elusive ~~bug~~ unintentional feature in development, I put in a popup box in a few places to narrow down what was happening. There are much smarter ways of doing this, but it was late at night and the hamster that powers me was about to fall off his wheel.

After narrowing it down to a particular section, my popups became less helpful to the point where they had no debugging value except for actually popping up. Eventually I found the problem, quickly fixed it (it was a pretty stupid bug), put it onto stability testing and went to bed. Later on I would add the finishing touches and some more coherent error codes just in case something did go wrong.

Fast forward two weeks after a successful deployment and a happy client, I get a meeting request to pop by their office to give them a hand with imaging a computer. They had tried themselves but it was having all sorts of problems and the software was not operating correctly on startup.

When I arrive at the office the client greets me at the door...

&gt;**Client:** Hey, thanks for coming at such short notice... But, I think the app is having some serious issues...  
**Me:** I'm sorry to hear that... lets see if we can resolve this problem... What's the error code it's showing?  
\***Client points to screen\***

The perfect storm happened, a bad imaging caused the computer to behave strangely, which in turn made the software bug out in strange new ways, which just so happened to be the very block of code where I put a ""temporary"" popup box stating the following error code: ""This S\*\*t is F\*\*\*ed"".

softlyandtenderly,Grandmas and Passwords,"LTL, FTP, on mobile, all that jazz. I wish that I could say that this was strictly a stupid user story, like many stories on here. Unfortunately, I also was stupid.

Backstory: I’m a computer science student in college, but I’ve been a bit of a techie for a while now. Thus, I generally function as my family’s tech support. Every time I’m home from school, at least two people (parents, grandparents, aunts, etc.) have something for me to fix. I’ve hooked up printers, wiped old devices, tried to convince people not to store passwords in note files on their phones, etc. Fun times.

I’m home for the weekend, and my grandma tells me over dinner that she’s having trouble with her Gmail accounts (plural, since she has to have others for her teaching jobs). Basically, students have been sending her Google Docs, which she now hates because she’s used to Word and can’t figure out how to use them. Apparently, she tried to sign in to view the docs and was unable to do so, and now she is having trouble with her account passwords.

I should mention before I continue that my grandma is in this weird state where she does a LOT on her computer, but she still doesn’t understand technology. This will become increasingly relevant as we continue.

To begin, she shows me her old, outdated iPhone, which has recently begun telling her that her primary Gmail account password is wrong and needs the correct password. No big deal, this has happened to me on my phone before. I proceed to delete the account from her phone in order to reinstall it and see if that fixes the problem.

This was a bad decision.

You see, I noticed just before I hit the delete button that in addition to mail, her Google account also synced contacts and calendar entries. I quickly realized, too late, that I was likely deleting most of her phone contacts. This setting (almost definitely without her knowledge) has probably been on her phone ever since her Gmail was set up on there. I view her contacts and ta-dah! Most of them are gone. Additionally, I find out afterwards that I can’t sign back into the account - she doesn’t know her password and hasn’t been able to reset it (due to the lack of a recovery phone or email on her account). 

This has suddenly turned into a much larger problem than it was.

I decide against telling her that this has occurred until I am able to fix it - she has already flipped out once this evening over how ridiculous it is that she has multiple Google accounts and how much she hates Google Docs. Instead, I spend the rest of dinner hiding my internal terror, frantically trying to reset the password, and getting us home from the restaurant as soon as possible.

Back at her house, I try a few things. I know from past experience that a lot of her passwords are stored in Firefox on her computer, and they can be viewed by clicking the “Show Passwords” button in the settings (why this is a thing, I do not know). The stored password doesn’t work. I try the password reset process again. Basically, if no recovery method is set, Google makes you enter a security question and a few other things, the last of which is the month and year the account was created. Neither of us remember this information - she has had this account for a LONG time. 

My solution is to search my inbox for the oldest email I can find from her and try that date. No dice. I move a month backward and try again. Still no dice. I try this with a few more months, and FINALLY a success. Google says they will send us an email in 6-12 hours with a reset link, i.e. not tonight. 

I end the evening by showing her how amazing my password manager is and telling her I’m setting her up with one tomorrow.

Rootman,Almost got fired for being TOO efficient! (I oughtta know beter!),"This was years ago, I might have shared this already, sorry if it's a rehash.  I think I remember all this correctly. 

Remember years ago when they extended the length of Daylight Saving Time? Well, Microsoft was supplying a fix for all their servers, with the exception of Windows 2000.  For that they wanted you to LICENSE and agreement for a patch, and of course it was a bunch of money.  So a group of people wrote a simple patch and released it as open source.  At that time we had a bunch of Windows 2000 servers left. So I snapped it up and tested it.  It worked great.

We had a phone meeting scheduled to discuss it's implementation. Me and 3 other guys were on the phone.  Since I had 'touched' the project *I* was elected to implement it. So they asked me how long it would take to do all the remaining servers that needed it.  I said 'A few hours, so give me a day'.

One bigwig spoke up:""Well, you know, we really ought to bring in Fred for this, he's very concerned about it and wanted to be included in the decision.""  So Fred joins in.  I repeat, ""A few hours, so give me a day"".  They hem, they haw, they take this entire thing to ridiculous extremes and keep ruminating the most insane BS I have heard in a long time.  

I got bored, so I parked the script in a folder that was on a drive that my AD account mapped a drive too.  I RDP's to a server and installed it.  I took seconds.  I worked my way down the list all the while listening to them drone on and on about this thing.

""Root, if it will take you a day we'd better give you a week just to make sure in case something comes up."".  ME:  ""Ummm, OK"", as I continued down the list of servers, patching each one. ""Well you know, George really ought to be brought in on this, he's had a lot of pressure from the muckity mucks abut this and is concerned about it.""  So we all wait for George to join in and they rehash it all over again.

""Well, Root, if they are giving you a week  then we ought to schedule two weeks just to give you enough time.""  At this point I'm barely listening, I'm just cruising down the list of servers patching each one and moving on to the next. 

So at the end of the meeting they ran over it again, two weeks to do a short job.  ""Root, is that OK with you?  Is it do-able?"" Now, this is where I really kick myself.  I actually spoke up and said not only is it do-able but I had only 3 more servers to patch, I had been patching them while I was on the phone call and would be done in 10 minutes.

Talk about a shit storm.  I was called everything under the sun, some nasty, other stuff like ""Not a team player"".  All for doing a project too quickly and efficiently.  After they all hung up and a  few hours went by my manager called me and said he managed to 'save my job', and convinced them it was all OK.

I oughtta know better!  I should have taken the 2 weeks and screwed around then finished it.    Some times you just have to 'play the game'. ",talesfromtechsupport,1928,1553271194
Oricu,"""Please send a USB to USB splitter cable modem wire for screens.""","I inherited this ticket from someone who left the company 4 months ago and he had the same issues with this person that I'm having.

&amp;#x200B;

The original ticket is: ""Please send a USB to USB splitter cable modem wire for screens.""

&amp;#x200B;

The other guy's notes were him desperately trying to get her to explain what kind of cable she was talking about because there is no such thing as a ""USB to USB splitter cable modem wire for screens"".

&amp;#x200B;

He gathered she meant some kind of video cable but we have computers ranging from VGA only to things that are a combo of VGA, DVI, HDMI, and/or Display Port connections so we kind of need to know what sort of video cable she needs.

&amp;#x200B;

He tried for 2 months to get her to send either a picture of the back of the computer or a picture of the single video cable she had so we could at least make a good guess.

&amp;#x200B;

She never responded to his ticket updates or returned his calls (based on his notes) so he'd close the ticket no response and she'd immediately open it all capsing at him about how dare he close the ticket when the issue isn't resolved and a repeat of the demand for a cable that doesn't exist.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, he quit, and I got the ticket.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to be a bit more direct and my first update on that ticket was: ""Hi $Name, unfortunately there is no such thing as a USB to USB splitter cable modem wire for screens so that's not something I can order for you as it doesn't exist.

If you're not sure what kind of cable it is, please take a picture of it that clearly shows the ends of the cable, or take a picture of the back of the computer, and we should be able to get you the right cable.

Thanks!""

&amp;#x200B;

She sent me a picture of the cable.

&amp;#x200B;

Just the middle part of it, no ends.

&amp;#x200B;

I let her know that I need a picture that shows the ENDS of the cable or the back of the computer before I can help her or I can schedule a tech to go on site (this site is 450 miles from where I am) if she'd prefer that. Normally, I could look up and see what kind of computer had that assigned number but, of course, for that particular one, it wasn't populating so I had no idea what kind of computer it was.

I asked her if I could remote in and take a look to see if I could at least get the computer model to figure out what might be needed.

&amp;#x200B;

Her snapped back response is, ""I'll deal with it myself.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, cool. Our sites are allowed to schedule techs to come out on their own if they want to.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And I hear nothing. Several calls, several voicemail messages not returned, no response to updates, I close it out no response with, ""No response from $Name since 3/5, closing no response.""

&amp;#x200B;

And, of course, she *immediately* reopens it with, ""Since none of you know anything about technology  I just went to $BigBoxRetailer and bought the HDMI cables myself, now I need you to remote into our router to authorize it to use wires for two screens.""

&amp;#x200B;

Nice of her to not acknowledge at no point in the past, had she ever said ""HDMI cable"". *Whatever.* 

&amp;#x200B;

But now, she's being super rude and telling me I'm stupid because she's--well--I won't say stupid, but she sure doesn't ""know technology"" as well as she thinks.

&amp;#x200B;

I respond with, ""If Windows is not seeing that you have two monitors hooked up to the computer, it's usually a BIOS setting *(for Intel NUCs, this is the case, and I did finally track down the actual paperwork for the computers this site has so I know now it's a NUC; if the display adapter settings are set to 'auto' instead of HDMI as the primary, sometimes Windows straight up will not even acknowledge you have a second monitor plugged in)* which I can't get at remotely but we can schedule a tech to come out and take a look.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She replies five minutes later telling me I'm useless because she ""doesn't want windows to see two screens"" she wants ""the router to be authorized to use wires for two screens"".

&amp;#x200B;

Uh. Yeah. I don't have the patience right now to explain to her everything wrong with that statement.

Some of the crew had been slack in writing (or requiring that they be written) tickets for each and every task, job or issue they address.  We were all told outright that the tickets are the only thing between us an unemployment - that is they proved the worth of our existence.  Gone are the days you simply kept things running smooth, now you have to document each and every thing you do so that management knows you are worth keeping.

So after a few warnings all the guys start writing tickets for everything they do.  There was a massive uptick in the number of tickets written, just what management wanted.

In the immortal words of ever TV product hawker ""But wait, there's MORE!"".  Management now sees masses of new tickets and they become concerned.  In fact now they toss us a new goal - ""To improve our number of problems handled and actively REDUCE the number of tickets that are being written and lower the number of incidents"".

GlitterbuttWaifu,"What, what did the janitor do in the server room?!","Figured I might as well share one of my favorite calls. It's been 3 years, so exact verbiage is a little fuzzy at this point, gist is there. 

To begin, I used to work for a major OEM's enterprise warranty support. This was for water treatment plant, for a local government.  Got a call at about 7pm... guy produced the required information to pull up the ticket and information.

Turns out, a server was surged due to a failed UPS. We sent a new UPS and a system exchange for the server rather than guess at parts. Nothing special, pretty run of the mill. 

The guy I had on the phone though, said the most beautiful thing. I couldn't help but help. 

""Hi, I know this is going sound a bit strange, but I'm the custodian here. My best friend is head of IT. I know he's been waiting on getting this going since it's the backup. I know the words here, could you help me replicate the domain controller? I don't know what that means, but I can follow instructions."" 

He admitted he didn't know what he was doing, and that he was willing to follow instructions, so hey, why not?

Had him take a picture of the back of the rack, explained how to remove the old system, the UPS, put in the new UPS, and setup the new system's wiring. Took a few tries with the pictures from his cell, and 'move this here, that there'. 

Once he got it up and working, it was able to ping outside immediately, which was good news. Remoted in, made sure the basics were setup, and stepped him through the few command line steps to complete replication. 

All was working, pinging, and setup correctly. Thank god for a sticky note on the front that had the required IP and subnet, and intelligent naming schemes. 

Took about 2 hours, all said and done, most of it waiting on pictures to upload. Once it was done, he wanted to know what city I lived in so he could mail me a 6 pack. I didn't oblige him, and let him know, admitting you don't know what you're doing and willing to follow instructions is MORE than enough. 

Yes, the IT contacted me the next day, and wanted to know what happened. I told them it was 'Soandso', the janitor, who called in and they took care of it. Apparently a bet was lost.

So one night after 6pm I get a text from Tina, the more senior of the two female techs. She's got some guy on the phone who ""wants to talk to a man"". He wouldn't tell her the problem, wouldn't troubleshoot, just ""I want to talk to a man."" 

Okay, I'll handle it, transfer him to me, don't start another call...

When I answer the phone he tries to launch into his issue but I cut him right off and proceed to rip him a new one. ""How would you like it if somebody tried that stupid \*&amp;\^% on your mother or wife or sister?"" was about the nicest thing I said to him.

To his credit he stayed on the phone and took it all. Finally I laid it out ""What we're going to do now is transfer you back to Tina, she will take care of your issue and when your problem is solved you will apologize PROFUSELY for what you said before, you will explain that its late and you're tired and you weren't thinking. Then, tomorrow you will do something very nice for a random stranger.""

And thats what we did, I stayed on the line while Tina took the call beaming with pride as she fixed his stupid simple issue in record time. He then made what sounded like a very sincere apology. I don't know if he actually did a random act of kindness but I like to think he did...",talesfromtechsupport,5046,1553097281

&amp;#x200B;

For some background, I work at a higher education help desk, and I was just recently promoted from Student Help Desk to Faculty/Staff Help Desk. So one of the first few real calls I take (i.e. on my own) a staff member has issues with her Outlook desktop app (probably 2016, I never did get to remote in. More on that later...)

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be **$ME**, because why not. The Staff member will be **$TL** (transfer lady), and my coworker will be **$AC** (awesome coworker). I'm not super creative with names (yet), but maybe I'll get there. I'm sure I'll have stories to come over the years.

&amp;#x200B;

So, here goes nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

**$ME**: $University Service Desk, my name is $ME, can I get your NetID? (not sure how prevalent the term is, but it's just the organizational AD username)

&amp;#x200B;

**$TL**: Sure, it's \*her NetID\*.

&amp;#x200B;

**$ME**: Alright, and how can I help you today?

&amp;#x200B;

**$TL**: Well, I've got my email on my personal phone and it's working fine. But the email on my desktop isn't. I can't seem to see an email my coworker sent me an hour ago, but it's on my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

**$ME**: Alright, well we can take a look at that. Can I ask--

&amp;#x200B;

**$TL**: Hang on, let me put you on hold. The Ricoh technician just showed up. We've been having a lot of issues lately.

&amp;#x200B;

**$ME**: *proceeds to be put on hold for 3 minutes.*

&amp;#x200B;

**$TL**: Alright, I'm back now. So, what do you think we can do?

&amp;#x200B;

I proceeded to walk her through various troubleshooting steps (confirmed it was the desktop app, confirmed she was on Windows 10, etc etc). At some point I decided that we'd try signing her out of Outlook and deleting her Outlook file so that we could have her sign back in and see if Outlook would behave. She was skeptical...

&amp;#x200B;

**$TL**: Will this affect my phone? I really don't want this to affect my phone... What about my emails on my computer? Will this delete them?

&amp;#x200B;

**$ME**: Well, yes, it will delete the emails. But our goal is to resync them, as they're stored on our Outlook server.

&amp;#x200B;

**$TL**: Okay... wait I think I see the test email I sent myself (no context as to whether it was on her phone or desktop, but she'd already hit sign out like I asked). Oh, and here's the Ricoh lady again.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I asked a neighboring tech to sign me into remote assistance since my access hadn't been set up yet. At this point **$TL** came back on the phone, and I offered remote in. She sounded pleased with the idea. I was in the middle of explaining that she'd have to click a different tech's name on our access website, when she decided she didn't like the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

**$TL**: Wait, you're *new*? 

&amp;#x200B;

**$ME**: Yes ma'am, I am. I haven't done many remote sessions, but I know how the system works.

&amp;#x200B;

**$TL**: I'm not sure I want you messing with this since you already messed up my email. 

&amp;#x200B;

**$ME**: Well, alright, if you don't trust me with it then I can just get the tech whose account I'm using to do it (the tech promptly got a call).

&amp;#x200B;

**$TL**: Yes, thank you. I'd much prefer someone with credentials. It's not that I don't trust you, I'd just prefer someone with more *experience*. (kind of offended at this point, but Ivory Tower and all)

&amp;#x200B;

**$ME**: I understand. It seems the other tech just got a call, but let me ask another tech about transferring you. (I got the okay from **$AC**) Alright, I'll transfer you now. Have a great day!

&amp;#x200B;

**$TL**: Thank you, you too.

&amp;#x200B;

**$TL** proceeds to complain to **$AC** that she hopes I didn't mess up her email, after she didn't want to sign out (never communicated that to me). **$AC** proceeded to tell her what I told her: the emails are on the server and would be resynced. However, **$AC** decided to just have her reboot. *Problem solved.* Technology is wild sometimes. **$TL** further complains about me... **$AC** told me about it later.

&amp;#x200B;

And so, that's the story of **$TL**. Maybe not that exciting, but I've never been treated that way by students. Seems like it's going to be a whole new world dealing with Faculty and Staff. Going to have to learn more about this Ivory Tower tactic...

&amp;#x200B;

Main takeaway is maybe it shouldn't have bothered me, but I guess the fact that I've got a fairly considerable IT background and being deemed too *inexperienced* to handle the call by the caller was kind of... frustrating. Not that she would know, but at the same time she assumed I was inexperienced because I was new. Just kind of frustrating to deal with.",talesfromtechsupport,759,1553058234
UnfeignedShip,How much water can my computer have inside of it before it stops working?,"Hello all!

This is the story of one narrowly missed Darwin Award.

Way back in the days of 2003 I worked a RV dealership chain as their sole systems admin.  This date is relevant to the story. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bob: A service desk manager (who really should have known better)

Mark: A service desk with newly found respect, bordering on worshipful awe, for your humble IT deity

Me: Said humble IT deity.

&amp;#x200B;

I was hanging out in my usual spot, our main office in a place south of Seattle.  Reading up on my hero, the BOFH, and his sidekick, PFY.  When my phone rings with the Island shop ringtone.  (I had different ringtones for different shops so I knew which ones to lob off to my PFY assistant.)

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hi, this is u/unfeignedship , how can I help you?

Bob: Hey, it's Bob in $location.  Got a quick question.  How much water can my computer have inside of it before I shouldn't turn it on?

Me: ...what?

Bob: You know the fish tank over my desk right?  Well it started leaking over the weekend...

&amp;#x200B;

(At this point it should be noted that our intrepid IT deity was well aware of the tendency for this level of user to call the monitor the computer and the computer the modem.  The IT deity also understood that CRT monitors have obscenely high charges stored within them due to the CRT acting as a massive capacitor requiring special discharge equipment.  What happens is what is frequently referred to euphemistically as a ""physics demonstration"".)

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Bob don't-

Bob: One sec, let me see if it will turn on.

Me: **NOOOOOOO!**  

&amp;#x200B;

At this moment, fate, which had been kind to Bob, by not burning down his office and building decided that Bob needed a lesson, or perhaps should serve as one, and let many coulombs of electrons find a quicker exit to ground that his usual circuit provided.  To this day I don't know why the electrons choose that path, but choose it they did and when they went, they brought a moment of light, magic smoke, and a hell of a bang with them.

In short, a short, provided by a bag of salty water named Bob.

The lights in the shop flickered and the loud bang in the office brought people running.

There was a distinct sound of Bob hitting the floor and the phone handset following him.

(It does trouble the author, our IT deity, that he's heard that sound enough to recognize it.)

  

Me: BOB! Are you okay?

&amp;#x200B;

I hear people entering the office and trying to wake Bob, one of them, Mark, picks up the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hey, Bob are you okay?

Mark: Who's this?  Bob's on his ass out cold.

Me: It's u/UnfeignedShip in IT.

Mark: Bob's computer exploded... did you do that?

Me: ...maybe.

&amp;#x200B;

And thus that's the story of how I made every shop tech and service manager in a dealership chain fear the awesomeness that is I.

Lurir,Why did you change your password? You're not allowed to do that!,"I posted this not too long ago and it got eaten in the spam filter. As it is about security (and at the time, unresolved), I wasn't too keen on messaging the mods about it to get it viewed. I've also forgotten the password to that throwaway account, so here it is in all its glory, rewritten for more anonymity and with a conclusion!

I started at a new company not too long ago. Although I'm not in an IT-capacity, I think I have enough knowledge to not be a $User in most of these posts. I hope.

The Players in this story are mostly self-explanatory:
**$Me**
**$Owner**
**$Receptionist**
**$SS**, or Safety Stan

Day 1:
**$SS:** Welcome aboard! I'm Safety Stan and I'll be giving you your orientation for the day. We'll start with a tour of the place, meet-n-greet with everyone, then get down to training.

*Cut to the end of Orientation*

**$SS:** Here's your information package. It has all the information you'll need - your company email address, cell phone number, landline extension, username, password, etc. Everything you need to know is on this paper.
**$Me:** Great, thanks. I'll just change the password, destroy the paper, then I'm good to go, right?
**$SS:** No, don't do that.
**$Me:** What? Destroy the paper?
**$SS:** No, you can do that. Don't change your password.
**$Me:** Why not? It doesn't look secure at all.
*Keep in mind, this password is your standard on-boarding password. Very generic, very easy to explain, very easy to remember. It was something to the effect of &lt;3 letters of street&gt;&lt;MY INITIALS&gt;&lt;street address number&gt;. Essentially, it is abcXY1234. Enough to pass the sniff check of a password checker, but not enough to warrant security.*
**$SS:** They like having access to everyone's account, so they keep the passwords the same so you can log in when you're not here. I suppose if you want to change the password, you can, but you'll have to tell $Receptionist. She can just update her log for you.

I didn't want to argue the case any more than I already had. I was the new guy, after all. Zero clout to throw around. I thought $SS was mistaken. After all, what would $IT say about something like this anyway? I'm sure they'd have words with $SS if this were actually the case.

Thinking it was just a mistake, I changed it from a generic formula to something a bit more powerful.

Day 15:
**$Owner:** $Me, log in to the conference room computer and show me what you've been working on.
**$Me:** Logs in, using a password that is considerably longer than their generic password. Length is strength!
**$Owner:** What's that? That doesn't look like the standard password.
**$Me:** It's not. I changed mine. It wasn't secure.
**$Owner:** That's now how we do things here. Did you share the change with $Receptionist?
**$Me:** *I can't believe that's actually a rule* Uhh.. no... I thought passwords were supposed to be secret &amp; secure?
**$Owner:** You need to share it with $Receptionist after this meeting.

After a fairly short (but well-received!) meeting with the $Owner, I went to $Receptionist begrudgingly.

**$Receptionist:** What's up?
**$Me:** I need to give you my password.
**$Receptionist:** You changed it? Why did you change it?
**$Me:** It wasn't secure. Why do you need to know what it is anyway?
**$Receptionist:** Well what if you aren't here and we need to log in to your account?
**$Me:** Why would you need to log in to my account? Can't IT get in if they need to?
**$Receptionist:** It's easier this way. What's your password so I can update the list?
*She proceeded to scour her files to find the document holding all the passwords. When she found it, she didn't have to unlock anything. It was just a regular Excel spreadsheet with usernames in one column and passwords in another.*
**$Me:** My password is a phrase. It's ""stopexplodingyoucowards"" *not actually my password... and my password is actually longer than that*
**$Receptionist:** Wait, what?
**$Me:** It's a quote. It's from Futurama. Phrases are easy to remember.
**$Receptionist:** But it doesn't have any numbers or symbols. And is it all lower case? That's not good.
**$Me:** It's the length of the password that makes it more secure, not all that hard-to-remember stuff. Phrases are super easy to use for them too. ""mypasswordissupersecure"", ""hisupernintendochalmers"", ""iamtheonewhoknocks"", etc.. All super easy to remember and type in. Much easier than ""P@s$w0rD"". *Note: My password is 29 characters long. Severe overkill, but it's a fun phrase and I don't mind typing it in.*

After reluctantly typing in my long phrase password, I asked another security question.

**$Me:** So what about any past employees? Disgruntled ones. Aren't you worried about them logging in and destroying stuff?
**$Receptionist:** No, I lock out their access.
**$Me:** Yeah, but what about other users?
**$Receptionist:** What other users. They're locked out, they can't get in.
**$Me:** What would stop a disgruntled employee from using another person's credentials to log in after they've been terminated? If all the passwords are the same as when we start, they would just need to use the password formula to log in as anyone. ""Receptionist / abcRR9999"" is your login information, right? What's to stop someone from going to the online portal and logging in as you right now?
**$Receptionist:** Hah, that wouldn't work. I would have locked out their access!

Clearly not getting it, I ended the conversation there. I don't know why $Receptionist has access to all of the passwords. Must be because our IT is outsourced on an ""as needed"" basis. Even still though, I don't know why he hasn't raised this as an issue.

This is where I ended my post previously. Fortunately, between then and now, we're allowed to change our passwords and keep them secret.",talesfromtechsupport,2998,1552953292

lawtechie,Lawtechie and the Chamber of Sensory Deprivation,"
  
I'm still working for a mid-market consulting firm, traveling around the US on short notice. After a few annoying trips, I've done the passive-aggressive method of job searching- switching my LinkedIn status to 'looking'.  
  
In the meantime, I've been asked to do an assessment of a vendor to a health insurer. Usually these start with some spreadsheets pushed back and forth and a status call or two.  
  
Instead, we get a firm ""We will let you visit where you can ask questions, but we're not filling out any paperwork"". For reasons that may become apparent, I'll call the vendor 'Skiff Health'. Skiff does some arcane work in 'utilization and metrics of healthcare outcomes', which usually means gathering lots of data and occasionally denying valid claims. 
  
Great. This is going to be all kinds of fun.  
  
Skiff is a subsidiary of a large ""We sell a lot of different things to the Federal government"" holding company, which I'll call Booze Martin. Both Skiff and Booze Martin are in the D.C. metro area so at least I don't have to fly out there. I can have some fun in DC while I'm at it. Stewart, Skiff's security officer on this assessment is a pain to schedule. They'll schedule, then cancel the night before due to 'important concerns'. I have to threaten with 'if we don't get this done by the end of the quarter, your contract with bigass health insurer will go away'.  
  
Of course, all this email is through Skiff's kludgy 'secure email portal' that 403s (forbidden) half the time. I'm already hating these people.  
  
One day, I get a call from a recruiter I don't hate. They have 'A great opportunity that requires my exact skill set'. They assure me that they mean it this time, but can't release the employer until I pass a preliminary background check. Fine. I want out of my current gig, so I send an up-to-date resume and agree to the usual credit, employment and criminal check. Not unusual and I soon forget about it.
  
Eventually the planets align two days before the end of the quarter and I'm going to visit Skiff. 
  
I get a bunch of meeting invites and I see that a bunch of people both Skiff and Booze Martin will be there. Interesting. I don't yet understand how involved Booze Martin is in the IT operations of Skiff.
  
The day before I'm supposed to go down, I get a phone call from someone at Booze Martin. They need more information for my background check 'before the process can continue'. I'm annoyed, since this has already been forwarded from my company, but I  don't want any reason for Skiff to delay the process. I answer their requests, including a list of ""All lawsuits and criminal cases I've been involved in"". That's odd, but I have a conflicts spreadsheet for when I was doing litigation, so I send it to them.  
  
I ride my motorcycle down the night before and stay in my favorite consultant kennel (a midrange chain hotel). About fifteen minutes before I'm supposed to leave to go to Skiff's office, I get an email from Stewart. It curtly lists the rules for me to follow at Skiff:  
  
* All electronic devices will have to be left in my car.   
* I am to wear my badge at all times and must be escorted within the facility.  
* I must sign a NDA before I can ask any questions.  
  
This is going to be stupid. I usually take notes on my laptop, so I print out the questionnaire and requirements documents in the hotel's business center. I leave my luggage, laptop and phone with the hotel desk clerk before I ride to Skiff HQ in a wealthy DC suburb.  
  
Skiff's offices are nice in a hyper-modern office building. Looks like they're setting up some kind of job fair/networking event in the lobby. The front desk is staffed by polite armed guards. Once they've validated my identity and that I'm here to see someone, I get photographed and am presented with a picture ID on a lanyard, then escorted to _another_ waiting room.    
  
About half an hour after we're supposed to start, Stewart shows up and escorts me to a small conference room. The conference room has no windows and is featureless other than a four person round table and a speaker phone. There's an odd hiss which I figure has to be a white noise generator.  
  
   
Stewart:""What's your clearance?""  
  
me:""You mean like Secret, Top Secret?  
  
Stewart (pointing to himself):""TS/SCI""  
  
me:""Congrats. I don't have one""  
  
Stewart:""That's a problem. I can't be as forthcoming then""   
  
me:""I don't understand. I work for a civilian health insurer. We're dealing with PHI, not Top Secret""  
  
Stewart:""Like I said, I can't talk about some things""
  
Stewart dials into a phone bridge and about ten people from Booze and Skiff say hello.   
  
After a quick explanation of what I'm doing, I start asking basic questions about how Skiff does things. Even straight forward questions like ""what development stack are you running"" or ""how do you select which patches to apply and how long before you apply the patch"" result in one of four responses from Stewart:  
  
1. Five minutes of exacting clarifying questions around the definition of ""server"" and ""patch""  
  
2. ""We have an internal standard for this where this is specified, but I can only describe it""
  
3. ""We comply with NIST 800-171, which we printed out for you""   
  
After about 30 minutes of this, I'm starting to have an out-of-body experience. I'm imagining myself this dialog on some old black &amp; white television like it's a 70's documentary of the Milgram experiment.   
  
We've gone on long enough on this. I'll try a different topic and see where we go.
  
Oddly enough, non technical questions aren't as painful. Areas such as background checks, doing role based access control and removing terminated employees are there. The answers are straight forward and pleasantly delivered, but they're all coming from the crew on the speakerphone.  
  
Stewart glares at me from across the table. I'm hoping that if I figure out a way to segue back into technical questions, I might get somewhere, since I have everybody else talking and some rapport has formed with the rest of his co-workers.   
  
me:""I have some questions about system hardening""  
  
Stewart:""You do, do you?""  
  
me:""I want to make sure our data is protected each step of the way""  
  
Stewart:""This is a stupid question. Our DC is in the Blue network. Do you know what that means?""  
  
me:""You're hosting it in a Blue Cross/Blue Shield datacenter?""  
  
Stewart:""It means it's *protected*, dumbass""  
  
me:""Alright. Do those systems talk to systems outside the datacenter?""    
  
Stewart:""Of course. You're wasting our time""    
   
me:""Ok. I'll try not to waste your time. Your systems are in a very nice data center. I get that. It's like a bank vault. They accept communications from the outside world, so under certain conditions, that big heavy bank vault door opens. I'd like to know when it opens and what else is there to protect our stuff""
  
Stewart (yelling):""Like I said, it's PROTECTED""  
  

  
me:""I understand. I'm going to call the project sponsor and see what they want to do. I want to thank you all for your time""  
  
I start walking out. Stewart is following me. I get to the elevator first. In the elevator, Stewart glares at me. I'm furious as well.  
  
The elevator door opens, I return my lanyard and walk away from Stewart and two armed guards.  
  
As I'm walking out, I see the networking/career fair has picked up a few people with Booze and Skiff gift bags. A few people have already dumped out some of the swag on spare tables. I pick up a few pens and one usb drive with a Skiff logo.  
  
I ride back to the hotel and pick up my laptop and phone.  
    
  
There are voicemails from the project sponsor and one number I don't recognize.  
  
I call the project sponsor first.  
  
Project Sponsor:""How's it going at Skiff?""  
  
me:""Not well. They're stonewalling our technical questions. We can either send another person do finish the assessment or we can lean on them. I don't think sending me back is the best approach.""  
  
Project Sponsor:""Are you sure?""  
  
me:""Pretty much.""  
  
Project Sponsor:""I'll call their CISO and see what I can shake loose""  
  
me:""I'm going to eat a big heavy lunch and try to not get stuck in Beltway traffic""  
  
My phone rings while I'm halfway through a bowl of pho. I answer because I'm stupid.  
  
Unknown Caller:""Hello, is this LawTechie?""  
  
me:""It is""  
  
Unknown Caller:""This is Vern, the CISO at Skiff. I'm sorry to be cryptic...""

lawtechie,Why Lawtechie no longer pulls cable...,"
  
When I first started in IT in the late 90s, I sought out any kind of paid sidework. I bought, refurbished and sold Macs. I kept half a trunk-full of tools,cables, spare drives, RAM and other parts so I could turn around quick upgrades and repairs no matter where I was. 
  
I'd take whatever I could get.  
  
One day a friend of a friend asks me to network a house he was renovating for a wealthy professional. The house in question is a four story brownstone/rowhouse in a gentrifying neighborhood. The friend of a friend would have to file ""It's complicated"" on his tax returns and affects a vaguely gangsteresque persona, so I'll call him Cousin Avi. 
  
I come up with a simple design- a switch in the basement and 802.11b APs for each of the four floors. Each room will have a phone, coax and ethernet jack with cabling running back to patch panels in the basement. 
  
I have a day job, so all my on-site work has to be nights and weekends. I get a key and the code to the alarm from Cousin Avi and stop by after work to see how the project's progressing.  
  
 
I'm walking through the building with a small note pad, figuring out what I need to order from the electrical supply house starting with G and what I can pull from my own inventory. Extension cables run from the neighbor's house to power drop lights and a few power tools.  
  
I hear voices in the building, so I figure I should introduce myself.  
  
I'm not the only night owl doing side work. That's how I met Bobby. Bobby's a fireplug that evolved opposable thumbs one day.  
  
Bobby's on a cell having a drawn out argument with someone, so I continue through the house. After a few minutes, I have my parts list and have an idea of when I should show up. I'm walking down stairs to leave when Bobby blocks my path.  
  
Bobby:""Who are you with?""  
  
me:""I'm putting in the network for Cousin Avi. I'm LawTechie, by the way""  
  
Bobby (looking me over):""What do you bench?""  
  
me:""That's a weightlifting thing, isn't it?""  
  
Bobby laughs, the way one laughs at a child and walks off.  
  
The next few nights, I run cable for an hour or two after dinner and before going to the bar. Sometimes Bobby and I will be working in the same room and he'll give me unsolicited advice in between rants about the IRS, his ex wives, child support, shitty bodybuilding supplements, small block Chevys and how the local sports team can't make the spread. 
  
He lectures me about my generation's work ethic while he's sitting on a box, drinking coffee and watching me snake cable. He's also convinced that working with computers isn't 'real work'. I find most of this amusing. I'm impressed by Bobby's ability to use the tool at hand instead of the correct tool. His go-to is a large pair of lineman's pliers. I've seen him use this amazing tool to drive nails, bend sheet metal, strip wires, crimp connectors, open bottles and trim his nails. I'm afraid to ask if he's used it for inexpensive dental work. 
  
I've set aside Saturday for testing the cabling and installing the router and wireless access points. I'm sitting in the basement removing the whiskey induced errors in my router and AP configs and just hoping for some quiet, which gets interrupted by the alarm actually working. I have to find the post-it note with the code and enter it on the one working panel, next to the alarm box in the basement room.  
  
Bobby shows up an hour later with a similarly powerful hangover. He's also angry at someone, so he's throwing things around upstairs, which booms in the empty house.
  
Of course, he needs to work on the main panel, which is in the same small room I've picked for the punch-down panel and the shelf for the router, modem and switch. He squeezes past me, smacking my head with a canvas toolbag. He grunts an apology.  
  
I go back to fighting with the router. I see Bobby reach into the breaker box with his pliers.  
  
me:""Uh, Bobby? I think we have power there""  
  
Bobby:""Ha. I'm the electrician, not you. Electricity's not dangerous if you respect it""  
  
Bobby's pliers and the two wires he was cutting through:""BANG!""  
  
I see a green flash and Bobby flies back to the other wall, then falls down. There's a smell of burned metal.  
  
Other than a little surprised, Bobby's fine, albeit a bit chastised.   
  
me:""I was going to say that it looks like we got the hookup from $City_Electric some time yesterday. I saw the 'line in' power light on the burglar alarm""  
  
After a minute or two, Bobby gets up.  
  
Bobby:""Well, that wasn't the first or last time that happens""  
  
I finished getting everything working and left written instructions on how to set up the cable or DSL modem to work with everything and if they couldn't work it, I'd stop by. I also emailed the instructions to Cousin Avi with the request to get paid.  
  
Of course, it took a few more emails and calls to get Avi to actually respond with a ""I'm cash-strapped right now, so once I sell this place, I'll get you some money""  
  
Someone may have gone past the location and changed the SSID to ""AVI_IS_A_DEADBEAT"", but I couldn't tell you who.   
  
I kept the pliers. The two conical holes in the cutting edge made great wire strippers.

Hell installing WiFi anywhere on campus came out of the locally funded student budget since the bigwigs don't view it as a necessity.  This ticket was a real treat between $Me and $ProfessorPaint since it was a new workstation setup for the user.

    $Me: They're right here on the front, I know its a little hard to see on these HP G2 models since it's all black.
    
    $ProfessorPaint: Can you paint them so I can see them better?  Where is the CDROM drive?
    
    $Me: ....Right here where i'm already pointing. And no we don't paint computers.
    
    $ProfessorPaint: Oh okay but what about the USB ports I have a lot of my class's work on my stick.
    
    $Me: R..right here where I'm still point.
    
    $ProfessorPaint: Is it okay if I paint the computer?  This is kind of ridiculous.
    
    $Me: Please don't try to paint the computer.  The warranty isn't going to cover any damage and your department will have to pay for another one.
    
    $ProfessorPaint: Fine just leave i'll figure this out myself.

Not 5 minutes after me getting back to the helpdesk the professor had called the supervisor's extension to complain that I didn't show her how to turn on the computer or use it.  It always kind of made me laugh how a lot of the professors were really great teachers but in turn refused to learn new things to the point where it was almost a block.  Not that our job was to teach end users how to use their tools but dam did she really want to paint it.

TheGelly,Why I Never Became Tech Support,"Quick story of the only ""IT"" experience I ever had and what convinced me to stay away from it. It's been a decently long time, so the details might be a bit off.

To preface, I was friends with a guy, FJ, who was starting a Minecraft server hosting service. This was a big deal to me, because as I heard it, FJ was making something over 50k a year and he wasn't even 18. He was looking for people who could potentially do support and I, the fool, thought my Minecraft experience with him would be applicable to tech support. Plus, if I was good enough, I could get paid for doing things online! Imagine that!

He was understandably reluctant, as I was both 14 and had no patience, but he decided to give me a trial run. To this day, I am not sure whether the person I was talking to was a real customer or was him pretending to be someone else - he insisted, even after the interaction, that it was a real guy. Here's what the text conversation looked something like on my end:

&gt;*Customer has connected with issue: bad ping*

&gt;Gelly: Hello, what can I help you with?

&gt;Customer: your service sucks. 

&gt;Customer: when I connect to my server on my computer through 127.0.0.1, i get 5 ms ping, but when i connect to the server i purchased through you guys, i get 150 ms. 

&gt;Customer: give me better ping.

&gt;Gelly: [befuddled] You can't compare local ping to server ping - unless you live right next to where our servers are hosted, you'll never get close.

&gt;Customer: what?

&gt;Gelly: Besides, 150 ms is pretty decent for Minecraft. What do you need lower for?

&gt;Customer: excuse me? i'm paying $XX a month for **** ping? get \*\*\*\*ed, \*\*\*\*hole. i'm done with you guys.

&gt;*Customer has disconnected*

&gt;Gelly: alright \*\*\*\* you too

FJ hits me up immediately to tell me that, no, you can't say that to a customer, even though it looks like they've disconnected, and I half-heartedly apologize. I realize that this might be the *average* user that pops into support and think of how much worse it gets from here. FJ and I agree I'm ""not cut out"" for this.

And thus, my short, unpaid foray into Tech Support ended. I have infinite respect for those of you out there dealing with this on a regular basis. Keep it real.",talesfromtechsupport,758,1552206691
jc88usus,Citrix Sales Guy done goofed...,"So this happened back in 2016ish, at a company I worked at that was ...re-evaluating contracts and had some budget surplus to burn. Massive company in the Fortune 500 level, lots of vertical ownership, and gave customers the illusion of choice with different brands that were all actually owned under the same company. Big Deal in the southeastern US.  


I was Tier 1 support at the time, but was willing to learn nearly anything I could, and would shadow the AS400 devs, AD admin guys, and often grabbed weekend OT on wiring projects and once did a Cisco phone rollout project over a single weekend.  


Our story begins when an email was passed around requesting anyone with knowledge/desire to learn about an upcoming Citrix project attend the sales meeting in the final phase. Being eager and knowing a bit about VM and thin clients at the time, I put my hat in the ring. I would assume they had higher hopes for turnout, but it ended up being myself ($me), the IT Director ($ITD), CIO ($cio), and a couple of other bigwigs all in a conference room with this poor Citrix guy. Not sure if we were locked in there with him, or if he was locked in with us...  


$Citrix: ""So here is a high level overview of all the services and processes we are going to be implementing. Any questions?""  


$ITD: ""So, let me make sure I understand. You and your installation team will be handling the equipment installation, set up, initial core user training, and long term support for this?""  


$CIO: ""Yes, so they are taking care of all of it for us!"" \*wide smile only a clueless beancounter can enjoy\*  


$ITD: \*looks at CIO\* ""Okay, so will be be getting support training for this?""  


$Citrix: \*looks at CIO, who smiles wider and nods\* ""Well, no, actually. Any support calls should get escalated to our team, as the support is part of your contract. Beyond low-level simple fixes at least...""  


$ITD and myself share the look that says ""Well, there goes the ship..."" and we realize we are well and truly ""mains voltage in the SAN array management port"" fucked, and so I speak up...  


$me: ""Okay, so you know we use AS400 right now. Could you explain to me how the VM and thin client setup you are going to be using is better or different from the mainframe/terminal confguration we have with AS400 currently? Also, what will be involved in moving the decades of customer data, contract information, financing records, and manufacturing history over to the new infrastructure from AS400? I know IBM is very cranky with data types and exports are usually difficult...""  


\*cue dead silence for around 3 minutes\*  


$CIO: ""How about we take lunch, and we can discuss that further afterwards?""

I spent about 3 months trying to troubleshoot an intermittent disconnection issue for a customer who was frustrated but actually quite patient and placid. I had engaged every team and provider involved and we were unable to diagnose the issue so I was tasked with calling this customer to advise that he was free to leave his contract without penalty as we were unable to provide the service. I'll be me, customer is cust:

Me: We've done everything we can to try to fix this issue and nothing has worked. I've been advised to tell you that you are free to cancel your contract without any fees but I feel compelled to tell you that most other ISPs would have the same problem as the technology used is mostly the same.
Cust.: So what you're telling me is that I can't get proper broadband?
Me: Using DSL technology, I don't believe you can. But you might have better luck with cable broadband.
Cust.: Ok. It's just weird that it works most of the time, like it's working right now! Oh no it just disconnected...

Me: Is your computer near a microwave or any kitchen equipment? Do you live above a restaurant or anything? (thinking EMI might be causing an issue, this was back in the early days of broadband remember)
Cust.: No nothing like that. My son just walked into the room and it died.
Me: Is he using any sort of CD player or any other gadget?
Cust.: No nothing like that. Oh he is wearing an ankle bracelet though, he's just been released from prison.

Our story starts with him being upset by our newly implemented self-service email quarantine.

So while everyone is gathering and chitchatting one of the managers walks up.  I'm sitting next to another guy in our department but he's a Business Analyst so he's not super technical even if he is getting the basics.

$MGR - Manager

$Me - Me

&amp;#x200B;

$MGR - Hey IT Guys, I have a question about this quarantine.

$Me - Yeah, what's up?

$MGR - I need to get the notifications about what's in there as soon as those emails come in, I can't wait until the following day.

$Me - Can't do that, it's on the lowest interval I can set it to, but there was a link in the instructions I sent out so you can just go check it any time you want.

$MGR - (Angry at my answer) - That's not good enough, I need to know when I have messages waiting for me.  Some of them are time sensitive!

$Me - I'm sorry but I can't.  

$MGR - You don't understand, I need this fixed now.

$Me - I'm sorry I still can't change it.

$MGR - Look, you need to understand that business doesn't stop just because we're not in the office.

$Me - I do understa....

$MGR - No is not an acceptable answer to this, you need to make it happen.

$Me - I do understand but....

MGR - No is not an acceptable answer to this!

$Me - Let me fini.....

MGR - No is not an acceptable answer to this!

$Me - Let me fini.....

MGR - No is not an acceptable answer to this! (the 3rd one might be gratuitous, I don't remember)

$Me - STOP!!!! Let me finish!   I'm pretty sure I can't do what you're asking but I can double check the settings I have available on the quarantine tomorrow just to make sure I didn't miss anything.  (I was confident in what I was saying but it wouldn't be the first time I was able to do something I thought I couldn't so I would double check).

$MGR - Now you're just telling me what you think is going to make me go away!  (even more pissed off).  

$Me - (Now I'm pissed off too, look him dead in the eyes and start banging my fingers into the table as I talk)  Look, I have to go give a presentation in less than a half hour.  I am NOT getting worked up over this right now.

$MGR - But I NEED you to get worked up over this now.

$Me - NO!  I'm not going to do that.

(I should note that I decided a long time ago that no problem is worth my mental health or emotional well-being and I wasn't going to get spun up over every problem big or small.  It doesn't help me, it doesn't help them, and it doesn't get the problem solved.  And I'm already on blood pressure meds).

$MGR - Well you need to find a way to make this happen.

$Me - Well then we need to find an whole new email solution for the company. (that made him pause)

I think a couple other things were said but I don't really remember what.  So I took my boss into the lobby and he said he'd handle it after explaining what happened.  Told me to just put it out of my mind and to just do the presentation like I practiced the day before.

So I got up there and rocked that speech like I had done it a hundred times before which felt pretty good since it was my first time really doing any real speaking in front of an audience like that.  I think I may have discovered a hidden talent!

I don't know what or if there will be fallout but I'm not too worried about it.  Either way, I'm not about to let a manager use their position to bully or intimidate me in front of half the company like that, or even in private.

One thing CW did was remove two shared HR mailboxes user had mapped in their outlook. 

But, CW decided to be a good little tech and open a ticket to our security team to have them remove user’s access to those to mailboxes, just to be safe. CW opened a ticket un the user’s name with the following description:

&gt;Please remove HR and Recruiting shared mailboxes – no longer in HR.

One of our security techs grabbed the ticket, and dutifully did as the ticket instructed; by completely deleting those two shared mailboxes from the exchange server. 

Maybe an hour later the screaming from HR began. 30 minutes after that the mailboxes had been restored. Another hour after that, security tech received a thorough bum-chewing from management. CW was talked to about the incident, but deemed not at fault since he didn’t actually delete the mailboxes.

Tundra_Dragon,Your Cat 5 cable is twisted the wrong direction!,"Quick Backstory... I worked for ""one of"" the worst ISPs in the US as inbound tech support for both customers and field techs.  Before they called us to ask us to change provisioning and port assignments, they had to verify all of their wiring.  I got in a bit of trouble for this because of a techs stupidity, but got off the hook for the same reason...   


Tech: Hey, I need you to lower their transmit rate.  I can't get good signal at the modem.    
Me: Alright, can you hook up at the side of the house and check the main line there?   
Tech: I already checked, its no good there either.   
Me: Alright, I still need you to check it.  I can't do this without confirming and recording the results from my side.    


Lowering someones connection speed would have detrimental affects on their internet speeds, and our ability to up-sell more shit to them in the future.  So, the tech grudgingly goes outside, hooks his meter up, and begins launching excuses as to why he's got perfect signal here, but garbage inside.   


Tech: Its because its a long run, and crosses an electrical line, and the last bit of wire in the house makes it way to long, and you know your measurement tools don't work half as well as ours in the field, so you need to lower the speeds.   
Me: Ok, but you have perfect sync here, and it shows you're only 600 foot from the node.... you've got to be well over 3K before we're even going to look at lowering it...   
Tech: naw, that's a flaw in your tool.  our field manager has sent several complaints up to the managers in your call center, and they've already changed policy, you just haven't got the Email yet. Go ask your manager, I'll wait.   
Me: Well, we do have policy changes nearly daily, and my manager isn't currently in, so I guess I gotta take your word for it... but, well.... There is one thing that could be the problem, but it probably isn't.    
Tech: oh yeah?  what's going on? ( techs like to find out this stuff early so they can be prepared to use it as BS ammunition later)   
Me: Well, could you strip the end off of the Cat 5 cable you have running from the port at the side of the house to the modem inside? tell me which direction the twists are going.  Are they all going the same direction?  and what way are they spinning?   
Tech: Alright... They're all spinning the same way, and they're spinning counter-clockwise.... Why, what's up?   
Me: &lt;sigh&gt; Not another one... I wish they'd get this taken care of already... but, you know how hard it is to get bad equipment and material out of the system... like that shipment where every single modem we had was bad?   
Tech: well, what is it? what's the problem?   
Me: well, you see... that cable is twisted the wrong way.    
Tech: ... ... uhh... what?   
Me: well, you see, the problem here is, it's when they make ethernet cables, they put twists in them to create an electromagnetic pulse to help carry the signal down the line...   
Tech: ... uh, yeah, yeah,   
Me: and well, the stuff they make for the northern hemisphere has to spin Clockwise, because of the Coriolis Effect.    
Tech: The what?   
Me: The Coriolis Affect... you know how toilets spin backwards in the southern hemisphere?  the geomagnetic fields can affect Ethernet transmissions at higher speeds.  old 10BaseT didn't have that trouble, and Short run 100BaseT connections aren't affected enough to notice it, but this is a gigabit ethernet, so it has to take the Coriolis Effect into account.   
Tech: ... oh... really?  wow, man, I never even thought about that... I think I remember them saying this back in training, but y'know, they have so much stuff to talk about there, and it can be hard to remember.   
Me: Yeah, I hear that... At least you guys get to work with your hands... all I got is a screen full of random looking numbers, and had to learn how to program in Linux.  (yes, I said that)   
Tech: Well, what can I do?   
Me: Well, go check your Van for a box of older cable... you might be able to find one that spins the right direction, and get it installed...   


I hear the tech shuffling around in his van, throwing boxes around, cussing...   
Tech: nope, that one's screwed too... nope... no... Shit I might.... Wait! I found one!  
Me: Excellent! Lets hook that up real quick, and give it a shot.  I'll wait on the line, because if it doesn't work, we're gonna need to change that connect speed!   
Tech: Man, I really appreciate your help here, and hanging on... I know you guys gotta be quick on your calls.   
Me: Naw, don't even worry about it.    


The tech took about 15 minutes to string the new cable through the house to the modem, trimmed out the ends, and hooked it up...   


Tech: Oh man! you were right! I got perfect sync now. Check those numbers!    
Me: Yep, everything looking perfect on my side.  I show 637 feet length, strong signal, and if you think you can upsell faster internet, they have more than enough headroom.    
Tech: cool! Thanks man! I love referrals! Can I put your ID into the messenger app and call you in the future?   
Me: sure thing, I got your back ( immediately blocked his ID on internal messenger app)   


So, that takes care of that... ... ... ...

3 days later, my manager calls me into her office

Manager: oh no, that's not good... and keep away from me! I don't want it yet  
Me: Sorry, I'll try... How can I help you today?   
Manager: Well, I got a call from a garage manager... Did you tell a tech that he had boxes of bad Ethernet cable?   
Me: haha holy shit that was hilarious.  you see, he refused to replace the main run, so I made a story up to convince him he needed to change that line  
Manager: I... see.  What did you tell him?   
Me: oh, y'know, how the Coriolis effect can mess with Ethernet transmissions if your cable is twisted the wrong way.  I got him to fix the problem, and and he got a referal out of it. Why?   
Manager: Well... when he got back to the garage, he threw out all of the boxes of cat 5 in his van, and his manager came in to him dumping a pallet of Cable into a dumpster... What did you tell him that he felt he needed to waste tens of thousands of dollars of company supplies?   
Me:  oh... umm... well, you know how the Coriolis Effect makes a toilet spin the other direction south of the equator?   
Manager: well yes,   
Me: well, you see, the same works for Ethernet cables, and he had some from the wrong hemisphere... Happens occasionally when China mis-ships something that should have gone to Australia.    
Manager: Oh... really?   
Me: Of course not. He refused to replace the main run, and I bet on the fact that somewhere in that truck, he was going to find a cat 5 cable that was from the other end... Which if you look at one end, it's clockwise...from the other, its counter clockwise.  He should have known that, or noticed it when he was stripping both ends to install plugs.

evilninjaduckie,"""Just circumvent company policy for me.""","I am at a multinational law firm, UK office. Lawyers are not great with technology. Even young lawyers, surprisingly. We have problems daily, although it's not always their fault - we are using some old case management software for example, because there isn't a better or newer replacement.

Every week lawyers are coming and going and working in multiple offices, connecting to multiple servers via VMWare Horizon Client to access filesystems and virtual workstations, etc.

We have it setup with RSA, so you need your token and two factor authentication if you're WFH or your hotel; but if you're on a company laptop and connected to company wifi: no problem, just connect without it.

We're in the process of replacing hard RSA tokens with authenticator app soft tokens, but it has to be done carefully and a bit at a time to ensure a) nobody gets locked out and b) it actually works with a small sample of users before we roll it out globally. Our UK and HK offices are on soft tokens, but not the US/CN/SA.

SO. PU (Problem User) came over from the US office last week. On Friday, she interrupts me in the middle of a phonecall saying that she wants to work from the hotel over the weekend, but has, uh, ""misplaced"" her hard token. Not to worry, we have spares. I'm in the middle of remotely supporting another ticket, so I ask somebody else to assign a fresh one from the back storage and temporarily disable the old one.

PU looks a little bit disgruntled at this. I think maybe it's because I've delegated the task to somebody else after she asked me, so I pause my ticket to speak, whereupon she says,

""I always seem to be misplacing my token. I'd rather not carry one around. Can't you just set my account not to need one?""

I say, sorry, no, that's not how our security policy works; my coworker comes over with the new token, and PU goes back to a desk with it in hand, lips tightly pursed. I don't hear anything of it until Monday.

On Monday, PU comes in again, and comes directly to my desk. She lost the token again - the new one she was just given. This isn't completely unheard of but I am a little bit perturbed by how she complained about having to carry/use it and then mysteriously lost it again.

&gt; **Me:** Okay, I'll deal with it.

&gt; **PU:** I know how to fix it. Just don't give me a new one and set me so I can log in without it.

&gt; **Me:** *-awkwardly chuckling-* I told you before the weekend, I can't do that.

&gt; **PU:** *-loses all pretence of politeness-* I KNOW you can do it. [User from UK office] told me about how you set it up so she doesn't have to carry these any more. So just do it. *-flounces away-*

Having spearheaded the change in our office from hard to soft token has come back to bite me on the proverbial ass. I ask my good boss [GB] if I can set PU up with a soft token. He says it's the US office's tech team's responsibility but only after we roll it out officially.

Out of interest, I check our ticketing system. PU has raised a lot of tickets over the last year. I filter it to ""RSA token"" and see tickets numbering in the double digits for replacement RSA tokens. Almost always with a complaint about them being too heavy or bulky for pockets or handbags.

I sign into the RSA admin console, check her profile and am greeted by a list of token serial numbers, some disabled; all marked as missing (except the newest). I show GB. I explain my theory that she hasn't actually lost any of them and just says that to try and pressure us into bypassing the policy for her. He nods sagely and arranges a meeting with her in the afternoon. I systematically go through the system and disable all the remaining tokens.

Later, on GB's request, I bring a small storage bin from the back room to the meeting.

&gt; **GB:** PU, I understand you don't want to use a token to sign in. However, this is part of the company security policy and is a necessity.

&gt; **PU:** I really have no idea why you can't just circumvent company policy for me. Just for me! I know the chairman personally. I'm sure he'll authorise it.

&gt; **GB:** I have already discussed the matter with HR. We will not circumvent company policy and risk our data security for anybody, regardless of seniority.

He nods to me. I open the storage bin to reveal a few dozen RSA tokens and take out a new one. PU lets out a small whine, like a toddler getting ready to have a tantrum.

&gt; **GB:** These aren't cheap, by the way. These little bits of plastic amount to about £60 apiece. So far you've cost the IT department a little over £2,100 in RSA tokens.

PU immediately quietens down; her eyes widen a little.

&gt; **Me:** So please try not to lose this one.

She leaves without complaint and without taking another token. On Tuesday, I find a plastic carrier bag on my desk containing about twenty tokens and a post-it that simply reads ""sorry"".

...the best part is that I still had to go over and, grinning widely, hand her another token since all of her old ones were disabled.",talesfromtechsupport,1893,1551907508
iridisalpha,Can I have a printout of your entire server?,"Some time around 1996, I somehow found myself in sole charge of a fairly big network of Solaris and SunOS workstations (that, in itself was a fairly bizarre story, given I was just a placement student and the company made military equipment). Despite software being one of the main things produced at the company, their IT policies were basically non-existent. Departments just bought equipment out of their own budgets, and users looked after them themselves.

Anyway, one day, I got a phone call from somebody in one of these other departments, which went something like this:

&gt;Stressed-Sounding Guy: Hi - you have a lot of Unix workstations, right?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yeah, why?  
&gt;  
&gt;SSG: Do you have any running SunOS?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: We're mostly on Solaris now, but at least one of the servers is still on SunOS. Why?  
&gt;  
&gt;SSG: Could you print out a directory listing of the whole machine for me?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ...

After a bit more back and forth he decided he only wanted listings for OS system folders, rather than every file on the machine. So, some time later (and after being driven close to madness by the unending scream of the dot matrix printer) I went over to his workshop with a big stack of fanfold paper listing every system file on a SunOS installation.

Turns out that what had happened was that one of his co-workers had gone on vacation for a few days, and this guy had decided he needed access to some of his files while he was away. Because they ran their own systems (and had no IT policy) this wasn't a problem, because all the users knew the root password. I think it was on a post-it note on the computer.

So he just logged in as root, went into his co-worker's directory, and set all the files so his own user account owned them. Something like:

&gt;chown -R ssg .

And all the files in the directory (and subdirectories - ""-R"" means recursive) became owned by SSG. But he realised that this wouldn't do hidden files (on Unix, these start with a period). And, for whatever reason, he decided it was vital that he took ownership of \*all\* the files. So, he did this:

&gt;chown -R ssg .\*

Then waited quite a long time until he panicked and killed the process.

The problem with this is that one of the first things "".\*"" matches is "".."", i.e. the parent folder. And, unfortunately, the files were in a folder that was just in the root of the drive. So, it went up to ""/"" then recursively changed ownership of all the files and folders in there. The result was that his user account owned about half the files on the system, including all the OS system files. Unsurprisingly, nothing much worked any more. Nobody could log in, and anybody who was logged in found that most of their software wouldn't run.

He didn't want to wipe and reinstall the OS, because nobody really knew what, exactly, was on the machine and, anyway, there was no backup. So his plan, it turned out, was to sit overnight at the VT terminal where he'd logged in as root (as that session was still active) with my printout of a working SunOS installation, and manually fix the ownership of every system file one-by-one until it worked again.

I brought him and backup tape drive and a SunOS installation CD. I think he gave up on the printout after a few hours.

IronCakeJono,When reliable support is beyond your pay grade,"LTL, FTP, all the usual stuff. For some context, I just got hired at a non-profit founded by a family member. non-profit means they don't have any real budget, so I got hired despite having 0 qualifications because the founder new me personally and new I enjoyed the tech field. They couldn't hire anyone else because no-one with actual qualification will work for the really low salary. The companies been running for a few years now, but due to being an NPO there are a few.. interesting things. Firstly, there has been no tech support until I joined, it was all run on a volunteer basis by the founders retired husband, so all the systems are coupled together messes, and secondly despite having 4 locations across the country we have less than 20 users. Now that the scene is set, let's begin:

Me: Myself, obviously, working from Location A (our head-office)
A: Person in charge of running Location B (Biggest public centre, 9 hour drive from Location A)
J: A user at Location B

I had just spent a week on a trip up to Location B to fix some of their systems. Murphy's law, everything breaks again as soon as I head back to Location A. One problem we had was that some computers didn't have internet access. Pinged, everything worked fine, but they couldn't resolve DNS. After some debugging, I found that the computers had static IP's set in windows, but that the network had DHCP configured, causing IP conflicts that stopped the computers from accessing the internet. Easy enough fix, set the PCs to use DHCP and went on my way.

Two days later (now back in Location A) I get a call saying they can't scan anything to these computers. I poke around the printers config for a while and find the culprit: The printer is trying to send the scans to specific IP addresses, so obviously it will break now that those computers are on a static IP (Of course no one told me this beforehand, but It's still my fault that ""I'm the one that broke the printer.""

So I call up the printer customer support and ask how they/we can change so we can have dynamic IPs and the scanning will still work. What followed was possible the most unhelpful tech I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. I won't go into details here, but he basically said that using static IPs was the way he had always done it and therefore the correct way of doing it, and that it wasn't his problem that it broke the rest of the network. Fine, okay, moving on.

I managed to find a work-around: Change the routers DHCP range to be smaller, and assign those PCs a static IP outside of the range. Worked perfectly.

This week and back up in Location B again, and lo and behold, we have a new problem: User J can't print. He can scan, mind you, so it's a completely new issue now, A assures me. So I start looking around: check the printer logs on the remote UI, nothing helpful (Who programs Error code to just say ""Status: Error"" anyway?). The old trusty google is no help at all today.

Finally, in desperation after fighting with this for 3 hours, a new idea: Check the logs on the printer itself instead of the remote UI.  And huzzah: and Error code. ""No valid department code/PIN"" Okay, I can work with that. Back to J:



* Me: Are you sure you're typing your code in right
* J: I don't have a code
* Me: What? Why not? Everyone has a code
* A: No he has a code, what are you talking about J?
* J: Well Ok yes I have one but the computer doesn't ask for it
* Me: (Internally) HOW? What did you break????
* Me: Ok I'll take a look at it

Get back to his PC, and sure enough, trying to print doesn't ask for a code. Weird. 

*Cue 3 more hours of fiddling with Driver settings*

Nothing.

But, during all that I noticed one thing that looked strange: The name of the driver. And so I go on a testing spree, and sure enough, I'm right: Everyone in the office has ""Generic PCL Driver"". Everyone, that is, except J. His computer has ""Specific Printer that we use Driver.""

I inform A, and she says to just install the new driver. I'm hesitant as A) I've tried to install the generic driver before and never gotten it working without calling in the tech from the printer company (Who I now never want to have to deal with again due to our last interaction) and B) why would the generic driver work if the specific one didn't?

But regardless, I go ahead and install the generic driver. And, like magic, the printer start asking for a code and printing correctly.

jaxmagicman,The Scream Test,"We switched Card Processors last year and during the process we were expected to return 2 routers to the old company when we were satisfied that we are balanced and we didn't need the old reports any more.

I made this clear during every meeting and after the conversion I would approach the department that used them and asked if they were satisfied with the move.  After about the 5th time I asked, their supervisor talked to me and asked if I would stop asking.  I told her I needed to know because I have some routers I need to send back.  She said, we don't use any routers so send them back.  I told her that yes you do. You use it for balancing reports.  She again said they don't use the reports.  I pointed out to her that she was logged on earlier that day and I could see in the logs that the router was being used.  She told me again that she didn't do that.  The report was wrong.

I sent her an email the next day explaining which program she was using that used the router, which report she had downloaded from the site and asked her to please start using the new system.  She responded back that my reports are wrong and that she was never in that system.

At this point I told her that I would be returning the router the next day and that the program would not be available.  Again, she told me that she did not use that program any more and that my reports from the router was wrong.

I had my tech that night remove the router and put it in a box.  We shipped it the next day and within minutes of the box leaving the building I get a ticket opened that she can't balance because she can't get on the program that of course she wasn't using.

I tell her again that that program was the old program and she needed to use the new program.  She says in the ticket that she is using the new program. I tell her ticket says the old program name and she says, that's just what she calls it.  So I log on to the new program and it's working fine.  I relay that to her and she says that I'm wrong, that it isn't working.  So I log on with her and have her show me.  She goes RIGHT to the old program and tries to log in.  I tell her again that program doesn't work any more and she asks why not, because it was working yesterday. 

I explain that it was the program I was sending emails about that she said she wasn't using.  She said that it was just easier to use the old program and that she really didn't want to use the new one, could I just make the old one work.  I told her that there was no way because the router was gone and she asks me to get it back.  I tell her that we aren't going to pay 2 companies to do the same thing and that she needs to learn the new program.  She tells me that she really didn't have time and I should have warned her before cutting it off.

&gt; ME: Thank you for calling the Service Center, how can I help you!    

&gt;Dr: Yes I am no longer getting any email and for the last few days I have been getting this bounce back from a company I used to work for stating the email address I entered was invalid.    

&gt;ME: Lets take a look at this

I shadowed into his computer and took a look at his outlook settings.

&gt;Dr: Not sure if this matters but I had my work email forwarded to my $MRI email as I didn't use the work one much.

First thing I check is rules. Bingo there is a rule stating to forward all emails to him, to his MRI Company email.

&gt;ME: Looks like the rule to forward you email is still in place. So when you got merged to our team and they turned off the $MRI  email. every message you got on our email was forwarded and bounced back as your email no longer exists at $MRI    

&gt; Dr: Is there anyway to get rid of all these bounce-backs? my email is showing full.

&gt;ME: Sure, shouldn't be a problem

I arranged his email list by from, selected the noreply@$MRI group and deleted the whole group.

Instantly this freed up several hundred Mb of space.

From what it looks like the email bounce-backs kept increasing in size. He forwarded a message to $MRI, got the auto reply, with the original email attached, then we forwarded it back because of his rule. Which then got sent back as an auto reply and an attachment. Going back and forth like a bunch of teenages going ""no you, no you...."" Increasing in size every time to the point his mailbox filled up and he stopped getting email.

&gt;ME: ok looks like it is fixed, with the rule removed and the bounce-backs deleted it appears to have resolved the issue as Everytime your email was forwarded it bounce-backed and then the bounce-back was forwarded which got bounce-backed and so on till your email ran out of room.

&gt;Dr: Thank you

&gt;ME: No problem, you might still get a few bounce backs that were delayed due to your email being out of space, however you should be able to delete them and they should eventually stop.

NerdyGuyRanting,Your wifi service doesn't have an international range? Lame.,"Last week I had a phone call that just baffled me. My field is Internet, TV and Telephone related issues, and I work for the biggest ISP in my country. I've had my fair share of nuts in this job. I could give some brief examples, but I'm gonna guess most of you know them all already. But this one took the price for me. I have never in my career heard such a dumb question. The conversation is translated to English, and therefore a bit paraphrased. 

Me: Hello and welcome to \*company\* technical support, my name is \*NerdyGuyRanting\*, how can I help you?

Customer (C): \*angry tone\* My dad is on vacation abroad and his wifi isn't working. It's very important that we sort this out.

Me: Well I can take a look and see if I can find out why. Can I please borrow his social security number?

C: \*Sighs annoyingly and gives info\*

Me: Thank you, I'm gonna have a look at the wifi.

I naively assumed that what she meant was that she was house sitting while her dad was on vacation. And the wifi in his home wasn't working. I was wrong. Everything looked fine. No cable faults. No local outages. Router working fine and responding to ping tests. Wifi turned on. There is nothing wrong whatsoever. So I figure, well time to do some real troubleshooting.

Me: When you're looking at available wifi networks, can you find your dad's wifi in the list?

C: No, I am connected to my own wifi.

Me: \*Confused\* Your own wifi? Do you live nearby?

C: \*Annoyed\* No, I live nowhere near him. Why does that matter?

Me: Are you in your own home now?

C: \*Annoyance becoming anger\* Are you going to fix my dad's wifi or not?

Me: I'm sorry, but everything seems to be working on our end. I can reach the router just fine. So I'd like it if someone could... 

C: \*Cutting me off still angry\* Well if ""everything is working on your end"" can you explain why my dad can't access his wifi?

If my brain was a computer, this was pretty much the stage when it starts freezing up a bit. Maybe stalling a couple of seconds.

Me: Sorry if I misunderstood, but didn't you say earlier your dad was on vacation?

Customer: \*With a sigh and a tone that clearly conveyed she considered *me* to be the idiot in this conversation\* So what if he is on vacation? His still needs to connect to his wifi. How else is he supposed to use the internet?

This is when my brain computer crashed so hard it needed a factory reset.

Me: Mam, that's not how wifi works. It only works when you are close to your router. And his router is at home. 

C: Eh, no. I am using \*competitor's internet\* and my wifi works wherever I am! I can always access the internet. 

Me: Are you sure you are not using mobile data?

A few seconds of silence.

C: Can you fix my dad's wifi or not?

Me: If he has run out of data on his plan or if his plan has blocked mobile data used internationally, I can connect you over to the mobile department so they can sort it out. Because there is nothing I can do here. His wifi is working, it just doesn't have a range that spans in to another country. 

Silence again, followed by:

C: This company has terrible service! I'm going to tell my dad to cancel his subscriptions with you and join \*competitor\*. 

Me: Have a nice day, mam. \*I hang up\*

How, in 2019, can a person be this oblivious to how wifi works. She wasn't even old. She was in her late 30's. That's what makes this so baffling. Had she been in her 70's or something it would have been easier to understand.

Easily the worst part though was her constant air of superiority. She really believed I was the idiot in this conversation. Holy shit. ",talesfromtechsupport,1957,1551689812
BethHill6,Non native speakers can't understand english!,"Obligatory, I'm on mobile so sorry for the format, also I'm not a native English speaker so apologies for any wrong grammar or spelling. TLDR at the bottom. 


So, let me start by saying I'm portuguese and I work for a call center and we mostly take calls from the UK. We all know English well enough that we got hired simply for our command of the language although obviously some of us have a very distinctive accent. As for me, customers can tell I'm not from the UK but I've also been asked many times if I'm American because, not wanting to toot my own horn, my accent is pretty good. 


On this fateful day I got a call from a British lady who sounded right away like she was pissed at the world and particularly me. 


Me= Me CL=Crazy Lady


Me: Good afternoon welcome to generic call center, my name is Mariana (it's not but it's a similarly common Portuguese name), can I get your name? 


CL: I don't want to speak to you, I don't want to speak to anyone portuguese, because you cannot understand me. Transfer me. 


Me: (wondering how she had any idea of my nationality) I apologise but I can only transfer you if I can have some details off you. 


CL is having none of that and her already condescending tone of voice, gets worse. 


CL: I am not going to give you any details, you do not understand me anyway. I want you to transfer me to someone who speaks english. I don't want to speak to any of you people. 


At this point I wonder if I've somehow forgotten to speak English and am speaking klingon but I keep my composure although I try to speak slower for her. 


Me: Ma'am again, I can definitely help you and transfer you over to someone else but my system literally cannot do it without your details


CL: You are being so rude. Obviously you can't understand anything I am saying because I already said I want an English person not you. I can't understand anything you say either. 


Now I can't hide a bit of laughter in my voice because the situation is ridiculous which prompts her to tell me:


CL: You need to apologise to me! You are being so rude and laughing at me. I can't believe this level of support I am having how dare you? 


Me: I do apologise if it seemed I was laughing at you, I was not. I can transfer you over right now to someone else then, if you give me your details… Are you understanding me right now at this moment? 


CL: I can understand you a little bit only… but why should I give you my name if you haven't even given me yours? This is ridiculous, just transfer me. 


Now at this point reddit I'm pretty much done with this woman who obviously understands everything I am saying despite her claims to the contrary and she is just wasting my time. I also know that if she does give me her details I am patching her over to someone else and she won't be my problem anymore… Also I know there's a big chance whoever she speaks to next won't be British either and that brings joy to my heart. 


But, it is at this moment that I apparently take her over the edge and commit the greatest sin. I tell her my name. 


Me: My name is Mariana like I said at the start of the ca… 


She is furious now I can imagine her literally foaming at the mouth with rage. 


CL: YOU ARE A LIAR! YOUR NAME IS NOT MARY. YOU'RE NO MORE MARY THAN I AM THE QUEEN. STOP LYING TO ME THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS HOW DARE YOU? THAT'S NOT A COMMON PORTUGUESE NAME. 


Now, first of all I didn't tell her any short nickname for my name, just my full one and it is very much a common portuguese name. Hell, there's about 6 people with the same name where I work alone. 


Me: But it is… That is my name. I don't have another one to give you… 


CL: LIAR!!!! 


And she screams and drops the call on me. I sigh in relief and decide to take my break. Thankfully nothing came of it because she never gave me any details which means no surveys went out to her, but to this day I still wonder how someone can be so angry at someone else just because they're not native English speakers… how many languages do YOU speak crazy lady? 


TLDR: Crazy lady calls call center and demands to speak to a native English speaker and says she cannot understand me and I do not understand her despite us communicating just fine. Then crazy lady accuses me of lying to her about my name because apparently she knows what are the common names in my country and I don't and couldn't possibly have one she never heard of.",talesfromtechsupport,1031,1551624568
CatKicker69,When the user told me no. #2,"(Global support)

I had a user who was trying to upload a Picture to our software program.  Simple enough right?

User: “I can’t figure out why my picture won’t upload.”
Me: -pulls up account and see she’s using an incompatible and out of date  browser, “the blue E”-

Me: I do see your web browser is out of date, I would suggest Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome and that would resolve the issue.

User: no. I’m not going to do that.

Me: ...well that is the issue, we could attempt to update internet explorer but it is in our public documentation that it is no longer supported. (Sends Public Link)

U: No. I’m not tech savvy enough to do that.

Me: here is (chrome/Firefox) link. I can walk you through this.

U: No, I want the E. I’m not changing.

Me:Well the problem is that your web browser is out of date and not supported by most web services.  If you are unable to access you would be needing to contact a local technician for assistance because this won’t work.

U: No, you have a horrible product and you should accommodate for all users.

AinTunez,"User provides no details in ticket, insists on a phone call, gives up when I refuse.","I work as a specialized sysadmin at a medical school. This means I'm the only support person for a particular system. I don't mind that, but to keep from getting overwhelmed during the busy seasons,  I have a personal policy that the user needs to make a good faith effort to resolve issues via the ticketing system before I make a phone call (except for emergencies). I enforce this policy year-round so that people are used to it.

It works well because 99% of the questions can be answered with one sentence and a link to the relevant user-facing literature. But some people just don't get it. Today, a ticket comes in from a professor, with the subject: `I'm trying to do {Task X}.` 

No message body, no other useful information. Keep in mind that {Task X} is a simple task (three clicks) with clear instructions available. The following exchange happens almost verbatim.

* [From `$AINTUNEZ`] Do you have a question about {X}?
* [From `$PROFESSOR`] Yes, please! Could we discuss it on the phone, please?
* [From `$AINTUNEZ`]: We need to try resolving it through the ticket first. What's your question?
* [From `$PROFESSOR`]: I need to do {Task X}.

So at this point, I'm like...okay, I guess she needs the instructions.

* [From `$AINTUNEZ`]: Please follow these instructions (link included) and let me know if that doesn't work.
* [From `$PROFESSOR`]: I tried that and it's not what I need.
* [From `$AINTUNEZ`]: Could you please explain what you're trying to do in more detail?

Normally at this point I'd give her a call, but she's given me ZERO information in the ticket and I can't set the precedent of responding to that..

* [From `$PROFESSOR`]: Emailing back and forth is time-consuming and inefficient. That's why I asked for a phone conversation.

\**Groan.**

* [From `$AINTUNEZ`]: We can't do a phone call until I have at least some basic information. Please describe your issue in as much detail as you can and I'll do my best to help you.
* [From `$PROFESSOR`]: Let me try to figure it myself, if I cannot again, I’ll be in touch with you. Thank you!

\**LOL?**

If she'd given me any details whatsoever, I would have gladly given her a phone call, but apparently our ticketing system is too scary. Here's hoping I don't get an angry message from the Dean saying ""Why didn't you help her?!""",talesfromtechsupport,911,1551480791

LigerXT5,"Router not working suddenly, many days working after last tech visit. Husband is furious, wife is having a good laugh now.","Some time back, the client originally had network issues and the husband figured a router reset was needed to clear up their internet issues.

Notice I said reset, not reboot or restart. My company had been out there a couple times before years past to configure their setup, along with a wifi extender, mainly for a tv in a garage/lounge for the kids and family. All in all, just a router, POE for wireless internet with the ISP, and a wifi extender, nothing fancy. Note: Client lives a few miles out of town.

Call in competitor company to troubleshoot their ongoing issues after the reset of the router. A second router was installed, as the inhouse tv, maybe 50 feet away from the main router, could not connect to the first router. The competitor also configured the Wifi, and not to the specs the client had originally. SSIDs and passwords. The tech kept the default SSIDs and passwords, but changed them ever so slightly.

I have no clue how long they worked with two routers.

I was called on site to troubleshoot wifi on an aging (Windows Vista) laptop. Before anyone jumps, the client is fully aware, she just uses it for sewing machine, and has lost the install media.

Between discovering their conflicting network and the laptop's wireless card is basically dead, the client approved fixing their wifi/network setup.

After everything was said and done, the internet is faster, and I made sure the house TV was able to connect to the main router with no issues, and the extender was playing nice. I left them a printed sheet of what their wifi and router settings are outside of default. Mainly the SSIDs (main and guest), Passwords, and Admin Panel login details. Nothing else changed outside of that.

A weekend passes and a couple days, we get a call from the husband who is very, very, upset. Nothing has internet, and they can't figure out what changes I had done.

As I was entirely confused, and approval from my boss, I made a rush trip out. The husband had left for an appointment, and I worked with the wife. They have not had any issues until the night before.

I check the wifi listing, and seen only the wifi extender, no others. Is the router powered on I wondered, worst case the router bit the dust. Found both the router and computer powered off, will not turn on, yet the backup battery unit is powered on.

But wait, there's a power strip on the floor, that isn't lit up. Turn it on, and the router lit up, and the computer is powering up.

Shortly after I confirmed all is working and all is well. The wife and I was guessing as to how the powerstrip was hit, as feet wouldn't have been able to hit it, and there are no children around (or visiting the last few days).

Then the wife realized she ran the Roomba yesterday.",talesfromtechsupport,617,1551376462
Louisthau,That moment when you learn your mother is a unicorn.,"Hello TFTS!

I am not sure this qualifies as ""tech-support"" so mods feel free to remove it if it doesn't. TLDR at the end.

Now as you might guess from the title of this post, this story concerns my mother. As we all know, parents in general can have a little trouble with all the new technologies that we young people embrace so easily. As someone in actual IT (network and system engineer), it has fallen on my shoulders to take care of the home tech-support for the family, which include but is not limited to :

* Faulty internet,
* Computer not connecting to router/printer/device/website/etc,
* Application problem,
* Printer drivers,
* Strange mails (often gross phishing attempts).
* etc.

However I am lucky in the sense that beside my father, my mother an brother are both knowledgeable in IT, and do not require my help unless they have already tried troubleshooting themselves for a while and still haven't found a solution.

They are also sometimes interested in my work and as such I often discuss it with them at the dinner table.

One evening, as I am re-telling how awful it was to actually take charge of new client infrastructures with non-commented scripts and missing documentation, my mother surprised me by saying that she always comments her code in excel and documents religiously all her IT work.

I was, as you can guess, a bit curious and asked her if she could show me.

She agreed.

As a bit of of context, my mother works as a externalized financial director in her own uni-personal company that she built herself : As such she uses excel **a lot**.

She showed me a 20 MB excel file. 1 excel file. 20 MB. For anybody working with excel you would understand what monster is a 20 MB file. She told me it wasn't even the biggest one she had put into place (the biggest one being close to a 100MB).

A file with macros designed to extract data from clients databases, format it and do all sort of calculations on them and then write all the results. The vbs section of the file (code part) had more than a 100 pages of code. Thousands of lines. But more importantly, I could see green (the color of comments) **everywhere**. And when I say everywhere, I mean that **more than 30% of the actual written content was comments** explaining what each individual function did and what each page of code was.

I was floored.

I also told her how proud I was of her.

&amp;#x200B;

I always try to look for a unicorn in my users at work, but who could have ever guessed that one would be so close all this time?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;**

* Discovered mom comments vbs code religiously.
* Am now living with unicorn.
* IT gene confirmed hereditary.

Septym,This box doesn't work,"After the huge positive turnout from my last story i have decided to post another. 


This story is from a few months ago, Same job small support team for a large tech company handling mainly networking equipment.   


  
 Me = Me  

 BM = BoxMan \[ The hero we don't need but deserve \]  


It's a another early morning and eerily quiet, One of those days that you just know something's going to go wrong but you just don't know what yet and then it happens I got call from BM , An elderly kind sounding man.  


&amp;#x200B;

BM : Help!

Me : \[Opening jargon\]

BM : Name is BoxMan and I need assistance with this box, It's about 12 x 6 and is frustrating.

Me : Certainly but before I can help you can you please provide the serial number of the product in question.

BM : Don't see no serial number on this thingies, Can you help me out a little bit?

Me : No problem, The serial number would be in \[serial number location\] It would look like \[this\].

BM : I'm not quite seeing it here is there any other way to get this “serialed number “ \[Not a typo, Actual quote\]

Me : Can you just quickly read off the model number for me?

BM : \[Model number\]

Me : Sure let's get this bad boy connected and we can pull it off the interface. 

BM : Okay I've got it directly on to the computer now.

Me : Perfect , To make this easier let's do a remote session \[ Talks through how to set up remote session \].

BM : Thanks so much I just can't get these computer thingies to work.

Me : No problem at all.

\[ A minute or so of attempting to connect later \]

Me : I can't seem to get connected any way through normal means what is the device currently showing?

\[ Audible shuffling and moving of large objects\]

BM : It's just sitting there.

Me : Do you see any lights?

BM : One moment \[ 5 Second pause \] , Yes there are some lights.  
Me : Okay that's a good sign are they flashing?  
BM : Yes there is one light that's flashing and one kind of circle light that stays solid.  


  
\[ We may even get through this yet, actual info I can use\]  


Me : And which light is flashing?

BM : It says HDD.

Me : That's odd for \[ Network Appliance \], These don't come with any kind of storage, Where specifically are you seeing this?  
BM : It's just next to the box.

Me : What?

BM : Yes it's on my computer, Which is just next to the box.

Me : Oh, I'm sorry for the confusion I meant what specific lights are on the box.  
BM : They there are no lights on the box what what are you talking about it's a box.  
Me :  Wait , wait , hold up , wait when you said box , you , you literally mean a box.  
BM : Yes I was looking for a way to get into this box it's still sealed up tight.  
Me : And then when you said you had it directly on the computer.  
BM : I just put it on the computer , I figured you know what you are doing.

Me : Right, well let's get something sharp and open up this box then I guess we'll get you connected.

&amp;#x200B;

\[After about five minutes of messing around with the box we finally got it out ,I've got the serial number and and get it connected to the PC.\]

  
BM : Okay, So I have internet now.?  
Me : We should in just a moment, you need to connect this up to your modem from your internet provider and we can get this configured.

BM : Y-you're my internet provider,  \[Angry\] This is an internet box, you provide internet.

Me : No.

BM : Well I payed for the internet box so I want my internet, give me internet and after all that trouble before, I want to better then just the basic.

Me : No.

BM : You can't just say no, Give me internet.

Me : No, we are not an internet provider , We cannot provide you with internet, We don't have it

BM : This is outrageous my son has an internet box from you and you provide him internet just fine and I know it's you because I connect my iPad to it and it says \[company name\].

Me : Right,You just connect to our device but the device doesn't give you internet.

BM : Yes it does, if I don't connect to it at my son's house I don't get the internet therefore it gives me the internet.

Me : Well I can't fault your logic there , But unfortunately I don't have internet to give you.

BM : But let's just get me connected to it and we'll see what happens, I want to get rid of this ‘ISP’ box and use you.

Me : Wait you have ‘ISP’?

BM : Yes they do my phone and such.

Me : Can you connect that extra wire to the box that they gave you.  
BM : I don't see why not I mean it's not doing anything.

Me : Okay let's just give this a minute \[mutes mic and bangs head on desk\]  


Coworker : That bad?  
Me : Just fucking end me.  
BM : See was that so hard I can see the aol's coming in on the computer.  
Me : \[Gives closing statement\]

\[Goes on break, Rests head on desk, Breathes deeply\]

Ian's ordering flowers.  
  
There's a dark part of me doing the cost-benefit analysis to letting Ian loose. Other than the web pen test, I've got enough to write a decent report, which fulfills our contract. Ian's blowing us up just means no implementation work or referrals and maybe some management-side fireworks which will burn his ass more than mine.  
  
I'm not going to intervene. I'm just going to document.  
  
I'm writing down my notes from the last meeting as well as a proposal for fixing their AD and catching up on all the work Javier hasn't done.   
  
Ian claims to be ""almost done"" with some findings. Lunch happens.   
  
I see a delivery person carrying a bouquet of flowers. They're set up in Betsy's cube, with a fair amount of finger pointing towards the conference room we've been camping in. She's not there yet. Ian's looking up from time to time to see when Betsy notices the flowers.  
  
I can't handle the cringe. I'm going to hide in my hotel room and do some work.   
  
I pack up and walk out to the parking lot. I find my van and get in it.  
  
As I drive out, I see Betsy walking into the office. I roll down my window and wave. She waves back. I stop to talk.  
  
Me:""I'm sorry.""  
  
Betsy:""For last night? You didn't send that email""  
  
Me:""No. You'll see""  
  
Betsy:""I don't understand""  
  
Me:""If you're annoyed, contact $boss- his email address is in the kickoff email""  
  
Betsy:""Is there a problem?""  
  
Me:""Not to the project. I shouldn't have brought it up. I'll see you tomorrow""  
  
Betsy seems a bit puzzled and annoyed.  
  
  
I drive my people hauler back to the hotel. I lie down on the bed and resume drafting our findings and recommendations. We're recommending that INSCO move their payments system into a small enclave that isn't directly connected to the Internet. If they don't like that, we recommend moving all their credit card ops into an iframe so INSCO never sees the credit card information, allowing them to dramatically reduce their burden under PCI.  
  
Making everybody use their own account with proper role-based least access as well is going to require some implementation work. This is going to be a pretty easy sale- INSCO can give us their money and problems and we'll make both go away. 
  
I take my writeup and email it to Stan, a fellow consultant at my firm who needs work. He's been 'on the bench' for two and a half months, which means there's someone thinking about laying him off to reduce costs. I ask him if my time &amp; effort estimates look right and if he's interested in the work.  
  
Stan doesn't bother emailing. He calls me. Normally I'd be annoyed while I'm trying to get work done, but he's probably the sanest person I'll talk to today.  
  
Stan:""Hey, LT! Your numbers look good. I'll start working on a plan""  
  
me:""I love your enthusiasm, but we haven't sold it yet. I'll put your name in to do it- it's right up your alley and if you need late night help, I'll help out to get you billable""  
  
Stan:""Thanks!""  
  
I say my good byes and go back to writing. I see that I have an email from Ian- it's a link to a file on our Sharepoint with findings on INSCO's web application. I send the proposal writeup to my boss with a recommendation for Stan.   
  
I grab the document without reviewing it and go back to task at hand. I want to get everything else in my report clean so I can just drop in Ian's stuff.  
  
I'm a fan of writing and drinking, but I'm out of beer. I take the transporter and pick up appropriate quantities of beer &amp; food, then drive back to the hotel.  
  
Walking back from the parking lot, I see Ian sitting at a picnic table. He doesn't look happy. He's not staring at a screen so it must be bad.  
  
me:""Hey. How are you doing?""  
  
Ian:""Not good. I'm in the friend zone""  
  
me:""Um, ok. Has anybody from our firm contacted you about this?""  
  
Ian:""No. Betsy hasn't been convinced yet. I should have bought her some jewelry""  
  
me:""Jewelry? That's not a good idea""  
  
Ian:""How do I convince her? Should I ask her out to dinner?""  
  
This requires alcohol. I put a beer in front of Ian and open one for myself.    
  
me:""Ian, Betsy isn't one of those dating sim games. I'm sure if she was interested, she'd let you know. It's rude to keep making advances at her job""  
  
Ian:""Should I go to her house?""  
  
me:""No, that's a worse idea. How about signing up for a dating app? I've heard that might work""  
  
Ian (getting annoyed):""So I should just stay in the friend zone""  
  
me:""Ian, you're not in the friend zone. You're not her friend. You're here to do a job and vanish. So's mine""  
  
My phone rings. My boss wants to talk about the additional work we can pitch INSCO. I wave goodby to Ian and walk to my room.  
  
I try to talk up Stan. My boss reminds me that 'Ian's well respected' and that since there's already a relationship with the client, Ian will stay here and do the additional work.   
  
me:""I don't think that's a good idea. Ian bought flowers for Betsy, the project sponsor. It's uncomfortable""  
  
Boss:""That's just a client expense, like buying a round of drinks""  
  
me:""Ok. Just thought you should know. I'll have the deliverable ready for QC tomorrow and I'll be flying back after that.""  
  
Boss:""Sounds good. Just make sure INSCO will like the report""  
  
Fast food and 3.2 beer make for a meal of sadness. Then I read Ian's findings from the web app pen test.  
  
Nothing. No vulnerabilities found. I find this hard to believe, given everything else I've seen this week.   
  
Well, Ian is 'well respected'. I work fairly late and get everything together in the doc, then send it to another consultant for a peer review.  
  
I have a slow start-drinking, dry air and late night deliverable writing can do that. I shower, put on a suit and make my way to INSCO's offices.   
  
I have a short meeting with Betsy and some kind of exec who seems bothered that I'm in his building.  
  
I try to simplify my findings and recommendations to three or four items. Exec derails me pretty quickly:  
  
Exec: ""I don't see you mentioning the firewall""  
  
me:""I noted you had a few, but they're not a concern for me""  
  
Exec:""But it's security""  
  
me:""It's a quality firewall, that's for sure, but you have other problems that it doesn't fix""  
  
Exec:""So, what do you want to sell us?""  
  
me:""I think you need to re-arrange what you already have to fix what we found""  
  
Exec:""I don't want to hear that bullshit.""  
  
me:""Yes, my company would like to sell you more time. I'd like to see you get some real security here for your customers. But I'm not paid a commission for that work. We do pretty good work. If you don't go with us, go with someone. You need the outside help""  
  
It's not the best sales pitch, but I wasn't expecting to do one this morning. Betsy walks out with me. I bid goodbye to a few people here, including Javier.   
  
Betsy:""Are you coming back to do the implementation?""  
  
me:""No, I'm on another engagement next week.""  
  
Betsy:""Are you taking Ian back with you?""  
  
me:""We took separate cars, so not yet. We're in different cities as well""  
  
Betsy:""So you rented that big van for yourself?""  
  
me:""That's all they had. U-Haul was closed""  
  
She laughs. I drive back to the hotel, collect my stuff. I pull in front of the lobby and offer a few passers-by a ride to the airport.  
  
I don't get any takers.  
  
I get to the airport early, so I take a leisurely meal and write some stories that may have ended up here.   
  
I don't see the fireworks until I get back home.  
  
Epilogue:  
  
* Stan wasn't put on the implementation work. A few weeks later, he was laid off. He's working now as a project manager at a large company and seems happier.  
  
* It took two days for Ian to really screw things up. I was cc'd on an email asking that he be removed from the INSCO implementation for 'inappropriate behavior'. I got called, first to pick up where Ian left off, then for a much less pleasant conversation with HR, who wondered why I didn't tell anybody that Ian was a problem. I left that discussion a bit wiser about how management views emails that don't fit with the story they like.  

* A few weeks later, the work from home policy was changed. Ian got to be a fully remote pentester, only to be fired a few months later for testing in production and knocking something over that didn't come back up cleanly.  
  
* Ever so often, I'll hear from Ian or someone who was thinking of hiring him. He's gone through some interesting phases. The red-pill/pickup artist phase was definitely more amusing than the cryptocurrency evangelist. 
  
* According to Javier's LinkedIn, he's an independent consultant now. I hope that's working out for him.   
  
I stayed at that consulting firm for a few more months, doing whatever came in the door, then moved to another job.

I work for a fairly large company that is currently being acquired by another fairly large company. In the process of migration, we need to change the IP ranges for some of our sites so they don't overlap with existing IPs of our acquiring company.

Last night, we were doing a wired DHCP change at one of our sites, which required us to stay a bit late and walk through the facility and test various devices to make sure their wired networking still worked. During testing, we noticed that a few of our desktop PCs were not picking up the new IP range and it stopped their network activity (network printing, accessing our intranet, etc.)

We suggested rebooting the computer to renew the lease as that is the easiest solution to explain (rather than telling our users to release/renew or pull the ethernet cable). One user last night stood out to me, though.

$Me: Alright, so just reboot the computer and it should be fixed. If it continues to give you issues, just call into the helpdesk and they can take care of things for you.

Largetas,Have you tried turning it off and on again - how that saved the shift and cured the anger of my postman.,"Hello friends,

&amp;#x200B;

LTL;FTP yadda yadda. No actual professional Tech-Supporter here.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I dont have much time, have to leave in 10 minutes.

Just wanted to tell you guys that my postman tried to scan a little package for me - as clarification here the postmen bring letters and little packages per bike.

&amp;#x200B;

He tried to scan my package and the camera didn't work. I had a look at the companies smartphone with the app.

Since i knew this exact phone (it's the same as my old one), does a little snap noise if the camera gets activated, i listened to it trying it again but nothing happened.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He has gone pissed already, calling a co-worker with his other phone, who doesn't know a solution too.

(I knew he was a fresh guy, starting, since i know my postmen/women)

&amp;#x200B;

I told him to restart it, he was curious why and i told him, well - that's what the people say to do first.

&amp;#x200B;

He restarted it and it was working like a charm again. Thanks tfts :D

  
Have a nice day!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Postmans' phone camera didn't work to scan the code. Told him to restart it and worked like a charm.",talesfromtechsupport,1214,1551172185
Septym,"Your product is trash, I want a refund.","I work with a small team that provides tech support for a company that produces many types of computing equipment, mainly networking devices. 

I work an early morning and weekend shift which with our tiny team size means i spend at least half of my week flying solo. Going to be a little long strap in. 

Me = Me
MU = Mac User


It's about 7 am on a sunday and my first call of the day rolls in.

Me : &lt;Opening garble starts but is interupted&gt;
MU : You suck, and so do your products

Now i'm not a tactful person by any means the fact i (still) have a consumer facing position confuses me. I also have a scottish accent that to my wife's amusement gets thicker as i get annoyed, drunk or flustered.

Me : &lt;Tone change&gt; Right, what can i do for you today.

MU : Your product sucks and i want a refund.

Me : Unfortunately we don't actually sell any of these products directly so we don't handle refunds but if you're having technical issues I can try and help y'out, if you want a refund you would have to talk to the vendor. 

MU : Unacceptable

Me : Right, well this is tech support, not sales and if you are just here to yell it me i don't want it. 

MU : If you would just do your job. . .

Me : &lt;Interupting&gt; What seems to be the issue.

MU :  Finally! Some service, I require a refund.

Me : No, as i stated previously we do not handle refunds. If you absolutely must process this through us it would be a replacement and only if there is a problem found on the device.

MU : Well this is unacceptable ,After you are done replacing my unit I would like to speak to someone in charge as this piece of crap does not work and the fact that you are making me jump through these hoops is unacceptable.

Me : Before we can even think about replacing this I will need to collect some information on the product such an serial number and your contact information and begin troubleshooting.

MU : Humph,Whatever as long as it gets done now! &lt;Provides info&gt;

Me : What seems to be the issue?

MU : It dosen't work! I need a refund. 

Me : Specifically what does the unit do that is causing the problem. 

MU : It won't connect to my mac, I have not had any other problems connecting things to my Mac so clearly your product is trash.

&lt;Finally information I can work with&gt;

Me : Is the ethernet cable connected from the unit to your network?

MU : HOW DARE YOU, You assume i have not connected this correctly? I am &lt;""I dont give a shit"" IT possition at big company&gt;, The cabling is connected and it's flashing green. 

Me : Ok, good we have network connection, What are the other lights on the front of the unit doing?

MU : Nothing, see its broken. When I try and turn on nothing happens therefore it is broken refund me now or I'll take this further. I hit the power button and nothing. 

Me : Power button?

MU : YES! THE FUCKING BUTTON ON THE FRONT OF THE TRASH BOX YOU SOLD ME!

Me : Read the button.

&lt;All i could muster without blowing my shit&gt;

MU : HOW D. . .

Me : Read the button.

MU : Pow. . . F-f-function. 

Me : Right, we calm?

MU : Yes sir &lt;sad&gt;

Me : Power switch is on the back of the unit. Turn that to on and tell me what happens.

MU :&lt;depressed tone&gt; power light is now flashing. 

Me : Once the unit is on you can use it.  Anything else i can do for you today.

dssntnt,How many login attempts do I get?,"I work in cybersecurity and sometimes cover a shift in our Security Operations Center. Our SOC handles account provisioning and provides our staff with privileged access workstations. These PAWs are MacBook Airs that are glorified thin clients. There is a local account for the user, and then they log into VDI to actually connect. A couple of days ago, I get a call from a user that goes like this:

$me: SOC, this is..., how can I help you?
$user: How many login attempts do I get before I lock myself out?
$me: Good question, where are you trying to log in?
$user: My Mac
$me: You get 10 attempts, but if you do lock it out, bring it to the SOC and we can unlock it for you.
$user: I'm onsite at a customer, can't come to the SOC.
$me: That's a local account, I can't manage it remotely. How many attempts have you made?
$user: More than 10 I think. And I know I'm using the correct password.
$me: That's odd. Maybe you are waiting long enough in between attempts that it isn't locking you out. Let me ask around if we have any other options to get you access.

At this point, I put them on speaker phone, mute myself, and start asking the rest of the SOC for ideas. I hear one of $user's coworkers come up and get told the story. Can't login, using the correct password, etc, etc. A couple minutes go by until...

$user: Oh my god, I'm using my personal computer.
$me: Yeah, that would be a problem.

I get off the phone and the rest of the SOC busts out laughing.

TL;DR User calls because they can't login to their work computer, even though they know the password is correct. Turns out they were trying to log into their personal computer with work credentials.

OweH_OweH,The Automatic-Problem-Solver,"I was working late again, because some things are better done at a later hour, where you can enjoy some peace and quiet. ^(No, not what you think! Maintenance of course!)

But, as is tradition in stories like this, the phone rings. I don't recognize the internal number, but since I am quite possible the last person working in the department, I pick up. Could be important, right? Right?

&gt; **O:** IT department, OweH speak...

&gt; **C:** *irate sounding male voice* Oh, finally, I am able to reach someone! I've been waiting for 5 hours and nobody has been at my office to fix The Problem or has even contacted me. I have urgent work to finish and nobody from IT contacted me.

&gt; **O:** I am sorry about that, can you please tell me your user ID so I can look up the necessary details?

&gt; **C:** Why do you need that? Don't you already see The Problem?

&gt; **O:** Umm, no, why would I see anything about a problem?

&gt; **C:** You **are* from the IT department, aren't you?

&gt; **O:** Yes, I am.

&gt; **C:** Then you should see The Problem! If you are really from the IT department then you should definitely see The Problem!

&gt; **O:** I am really sorry, but I really have no idea what you are talking about. What problem?

&gt; **C:** *heavy sigh* The Problem! The! Problem! Here! On my computer! The Problem!

&gt; **O:** Ah. But please tell me your name and user ID so I can verify your identity.

&gt; **C:** *heavy sigh* I am Mr Doe and my user ID is kdoe1234.

&gt; **O:** *clickety-clack* OK, Mr Doe from Faculty XY, and now please describe your problem.

&gt; **C:** Can't you see The Problem? You should already know about The Problem! And nobody contacted me for 5 hours and I was waiting here!

&gt; **O:** Sorry, but as I already said, I have unfortunately no idea what your problem is. *(Well, I have a hunch, but I have not the necessary medical degree to solve it.)*

&gt; **C:** The Error! Here, on my computer! There is An Error and I expected the IT department to contact me to solve The Problem!

&gt; **O:** What kind of error? Do you have an error message? Can you describe what you did when the error occured?

&gt; **C:** Can't you see The Error? It's here on my PC! There! See?

&gt; **O:** No, I can't see the error or the problem on your PC from here, you need to tell me.

&gt; **C:** Why? Why can't you see The Error? Here, it is on my PC!

&gt; **O:** I get that is on your screen, but I can not see your screen.

*(Intermission: Only a small subset of desktop PCs are directly managed by the IT department and have a screen-sharing tool preinstalled which can be activated by a user (but never from the supporting admin, unless nobody is logged in) during a support call. Most other PCs are more BYOD-style where each faculty buys and manages their own. Those usually don't have any screen-sharing software installed. Most users don't even want this out of privacy concerns.)*

&gt; **C:** Why?

&gt; **O:** Wha...? Why ""Why?""? I just can't!

&gt; **C:** Why?

&gt; **O:** Why would I want to see your screen? Why do you think I can see your screen?

&gt; **C:** Because of The Error! Here, on my PC! I waited for 5 hours and nobody contacted me!

&gt; **O:** Did you report the error to the IT department?

&gt; **C:** Why should I?

&gt; **O:** Err, so that we know about the error?

&gt; **C:** Doesn't this happen automatically?

&gt; **O:** Umm, no? 

&gt; **C:** Why not?

&gt; **O:** Err, why should it? How should it? Umm?!

&gt; **C:** Then how do you know about errors?

&gt; **O:** The users report them, when they happen? How else?

&gt; **C:** This is unusual! The system always automatically reports errors, I never had to call myself.

&gt; **O:** Which system? *My confusion must have been tangible at that point.*

&gt; **C:** The PC, here. It has A Problem!

&gt; **O:** No computers don't do that, normally. If you have a problem, you can send a mail to support@uni.versity or in an emergency call our support hotline.

&gt; **C:** Odd.

&gt; **O:** Err, right. Now, what kind of error do you see at the moment.

&gt; **C:** You really can't see The Problem on my PC here?

*If he says ""The Problem"" again, I am going to use the RSP on him, oh I will.*

&gt; **O:** No, I can't. You have to read the error message to me and describe the steps you took to get to the error.

&gt; **C:** *heavy sigh* OK, I was writing my report and inserted some images and then clicked on the File menu and on Save As and typed in the file name and then The Problem happened ....

*Arghllllll.*

&gt; **O:** Yeah? And? The message?

&gt; **C:** A new window appeared with a round red X and it says ""Error: Filename already exists.""

&gt; **O:** Umm, there is already a file with the name you selected. You have to choose a different one to save you document.

&gt; **C:** But it is An Error! Here, on my PC. I waited for 5 hours and nobody contacted me.

*internal sobbing*

&gt; **O:** Err, but this message is really benign. Just click OK and choose a different name!

&gt; **C:** But when An Error occurs, I have to wait for IT to solve it!

&gt; **O:** No, this is a normal problem which can happen quite easily. Just click OK, and type in a different file name and you should be good to go.

&gt; **C:** Are you sure? Can't you come over here and solve The Problem?

&gt; **O:** *nearly choking* No, that will not be possible. You just have to click on OK and select a different file name. Please, try it.

&gt; **C:** If you insist. But this is highly unusual. IT normally solves All Problems!

*Right. World Hunger and Cancer is next on my list, right after this call.*

&gt; **O:** Please, I know it will work.

&gt; **C:** OK, I clicked OK. Are you sure?

&gt; **O:** *firm* Yes!

&gt; **C:** I typed in a new name. Should I click OK again?

&gt; **O:** Yes, please do.

&gt; **C:** The window went away!

&gt; **O:** Of course, it saved the file under the new name. The new name should also be visible in the window title.

&gt; **C:** Yes, it does. But why wasn't The Error automatically reported? I waited 5 hours for someone to contact me.

&gt; **O:** *with growing despair* I can't really say. Please send an email to support@uni.versity so my colleagues can look into the matter.

&gt; **C:** I see. Good evening *click*

&gt; **O:** *just staring at the receiver in my hand for 5 minutes before hanging up*

Gambatte,Encyclopædia Moronica: T is for Triplicate,"It was a golden summer afternoon that stretched interminably into the early evening, and a Friday as well. The weekend beckoned with whispered promises of lengthy lie-ins and lazily lounging through the day, and a chilled glass sweated cool beads on the kitchen bench as it awaited the arrival of a crisp, cold beer.  
All in all, this Friday afternoon held all the promises of a weekend spent idle.

It was, of course, all a lie.  
I was on call.

On the plus side, I did not start until 4:30, and the chances of getting a call first thing were minusc-

&gt; PHONE: Screw you, weekend! I mean, RIIIIIIIING!!!

I checked the time. 16:31.  
Dammit.

&gt; ME: *{Company greeting}*, Gambatte speaking.

&gt; Other Tech (OT): Hey man, I'm so glad you picked up!

Other Tech is in a weird position, in terms of his experience. He's been a technician for decades, but worked in a different part of the industry when his ex-employer split divisions a decade or so back. However, a decade or so and a redundancy payout later, he was back on the market, and ended up working with/for me.  
So he's a skilled technician with a wealth of experience - it's just that some of it is completely irrelevant, and some of it is industry-specific Corporate Knowledge, previously considered Lost to the Ages.

&gt; ME: Well I've been on call for almost a whole minute now. What's up?

&gt; OT: You know how *{equipment A}* gets connected to *{equipment B}*, which is connected to the computer, right?

&gt; ME: Yeah?

&gt; OT: Well I just replaced *{equipment B}* and now *{equipment A}* isn't working.

&gt; ME: Huh, that's weird. I mean, it'd be rare, be not impossible of for *{equipment B}* to have a dead connection port, straight out of the box-

&gt; OT: I changed *{equipment B}* **THREE** times. Same on all of them. I even put the original fault one back in and it's still the same!

&gt; ME: ...That's weird.

&gt; OT: I know!

It's worth pointing out that *{equipment A}* connects to *{equipment B}* via it's own (normally white) cable. *{Equipment B}* normally connects to the computer via a custom multiple connector cable (normally black).

&gt; ME: What happens when you try *{troubleshooting action}*?

&gt; OT: Nothing at all! It's just completely dead!

&gt; ME: Damn, that's weird. Just to check the bleedingly obvious - is the white cable plugged in properly to the right jack? I remember I had one a while ago where the new model of *{equipment B}* had moved the jack and put a similarly shaped one in it's place, took me a day of swapping stuff out to realise that I'd just plugged into the wrong jack.

&gt; OT: Yeah it's in the right jack. But the cable is black, not white.

&gt; ME: ...

&gt; OT: ...

&gt; ME: You know what the issue is now, right?

&gt; OT: I've plugged in the wrong cable, haven't I?

&gt; ME: At least three times now.

&gt; OT: You know those words we don't say on customer's sites?

&gt; ME: Yes.

&gt; OT: I'm thinking them really loud, right now.

&gt; ME: I don't blame you.

Yes, the black multi-connector cable had one connector that was very similar to the connector for *{equipment A}*. However, the other end of that cable ends up nowhere near the install location for *{equipment A}*, which is why it has it's own one.

&gt; OT: On the plus side, it IS working now. I feel like an idiot, though.

&gt; ME: Eliminating the air gap in the data path has been known to have that effect.

&gt; OT: Feeling like an idiot, or...?

&gt; ME: Yes.

---

With a minimum of further gentle ribbing, we ended the call, and I went on to enjoy a weekend of peace and quiet, with no emergency call outs at all.  
I mean, it wasn't *that* weekend - eighteen hours of emergency calls saw to that. But eventually, several weeks later, there was a peaceful weekend. Which is as close to a happy ending as a technician can ask for.",talesfromtechsupport,883,1550626483
Radijs,Yes I can access management's files,"A quick one for you all to enjoy.

Recently we migrated our files to $cloudservice and we've been busy optimizing the shared folders in our organization. I say we, but mostly it's been ME. I'm pretty much the only active admin in the system. My colleague focusing more on the systems surrounding HR.  
One of the folders I created was for the management team so they could more easily share files. And as I was still busy authorizing users I was listed as one of the members who had access to the folder the folder was still empty, and there wasn't any data in there.

Cue a snappy e-mail from the management secretary

&gt;""Hi Radijs,

&gt;I've been looking at the new folders and I saw that the member count is off by one. I saw you're one of the members of the folder. There's sensitive data in this folder to which you're not privy.  
Why is your account a member and not the $drivemanagement?  
Please correct this ASAP.

&gt;""Dear $secretary,

&gt;I am in the process of organizing these new folders for you and the management team. As I'm on of two administrators in the system I have unfettered access to all files and folders.  
At a later stage I will remove my own membership and replace it with $drivemanagement.  
I commend you for you vigilance in this matter.  
If I have to provide support later on or do any kind of troubleshooting I also have access to the $drivemanagement account and I can always reinstate my own privileges towards any shared folder. So I will still have access regardless.

Turbojelly,Panic at the Server Space.,"I work for a company that owns and runs multiple private schools around the world. I am online IT support for 2 schools. Today I almost had a panic attack.



School holidays, things are calmer, I'm trying to clear out my ticket queue. A use calls me with an error message on Outdated financial software. I have a look, the error is about missing files but the network locations are correct, so next step is to look at the folder. It's empty!


Nothing to worry about, probably a logging in issue I tell myself, until the user mentions that it was working 5 minutes ago. I check her other network drives, empty too. She shares her office so I ask her co worker to check their network folders. They're empty too. At this point my adrenal glands decide it's a good time to kick into action.


I go to my laptop, and I have an email from someone at Head Office saying ""I have freed up over 100gb of space on your server"" that pesky gland decides to open up a keg and have a party.


Note: This server runs 2003, I have been fighting it for space for the last 2 years, Head Office has told me there is no space left on the esx to extend the drives, the idea of well over 100gb miraculously appearing on the server fills me with dread.


Quickly I remote into the server and check for myself, most the network drives are empty..... WTF? Time to send angry email to head office (literally titled ""WHAT HAVE YOU DONE??"") and make some calls.


15 minutes later a larger picture starts to appear. Turns out that space was allocated a while ago but was never activated. After 2 years someone realised this and activated the space, this somehow caused the network drives to appear empty. One server restart later and things are working again and the party shuts down. Things seem back to normal, for now.


Tl;dr Server Space, the final frontier, this is the journey of USS Trynottocrapmypants. Our mission is to boldy save where no one has saved before.",talesfromtechsupport,1133,1550577101
AlexisColoun,We didn't break it,"Hi tfts!

&amp;#x200B;

This is a short story from my new job as a technical draftsman. I am also the goto level0 tech, because I am kind of tech savvy (aka: I know, how to plug an ethernet-plug into a switch).

On a side note: English is not my native language and tl;dr at the end

&amp;#x200B;

The technical office consists of three teams.

One team for assembly planning with a teamlead and a bunch of draftsmen and two teams for preliminary planning each consisting of a TeamLead - $TL1 and $TL2 - and a technical draftsman - $DM1 and $me.

Everybody has their own workstation and there is one Notebook with a special software ($soft) on it, which is shared between $TL1 and $TL2. This Notebook is not the newest. About six, or seven years old and has only a few hundert MB of free space left on its HDD. Saving all the files from there onto our (very well backed up) server, seems to be a to enormous act, so nobody wants to do it. And as I was suggesting to do it, I was told off.

Also, it is connected to the wifi and there is an ethernet cable for it, just below the desk.

&amp;#x200B;

The Cast:

$TL1 - Expertise in human form, nice guy, grown up before PCs came out

$TL2 - Knows how to install M$ Doors and how to plug in an ethernet cord. Doesn't tell anybody about it.

$me - Tormentor of CAD software by day - Master of sound by night - IT support for the sake of it

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The day prior to this story.

My Teamlead $TL2 and me were finishing one of our projects within $soft.

Everything worked just fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Day 0:

$TL1 wanted to do some work on a project in $soft. So he pulls the Notebook from its place on the window ledge, places it in front of him and boots it up.

&amp;#x200B;

$TL1: *What the fuck did you do?*

&amp;#x200B;

$TL2 and I looked up from our work.

&amp;#x200B;

$TL2: *What's up?*

&amp;#x200B;

$TL1: *What the fuck did you do that this @$§€%&amp; Notebook won't work?*

&amp;#x200B;

$TL2: *Nothing.*

&amp;#x200B;

$TL1: *And why am I not able to get onto the server?*

&amp;#x200B;

$me: *Are you connected to the network?*

&amp;#x200B;

$TL1:  *OF COURSE! I am not stupid. You broke it!*

&amp;#x200B;

$TL2: *We didn't break it. Yesterday it worked just fine.*

&amp;#x200B;

$me: *Is it connected by wifi, or by cable?*

&amp;#x200B;

$TL1: *By wifi. The cable doesn't work.*

&amp;#x200B;

I got up and walked over to $TL1s desk.

The little wifi symbol in the taskbar showed ""no connection"" and no network drives were accessible.

&amp;#x200B;

And here is the point, where I have to tell you - my dear reader - a little something.

The Notebook is connected to the wifi. As in: ""It was once connected and had it saved to auto reconnect"".

The problem: The single AP for this wifi is located on the other end of the building.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew for a fact, that the cable works just fine and had no idea, why $TL1 thought it doesn't.

So I reached under the desk for the cable, while I was thinking about a bunch of stories I've read on this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

$me: *$TL1, plug it in, I'll check the other end.*

&amp;#x200B;

After handing the jack to $TL1, I walked to the small desktop switch, where the cable comes from, unplugged it (it was not loose at all) and plugged it back in with light pressure, just to hear that satisfying click sound.

&amp;#x200B;

After a few seconds

$me: *Does it work now?*

&amp;#x200B;

$TL1: *Yes.*

&amp;#x200B;

I pulled out my smartphone and opened up a wifi analyzer app and selected the company wifi.

Then I showed it to $TL1.

This app shows how strong the signal of a wifi network is. And the pointer twitched - far away from the green area of the scale - at roundabout -88 dBm. The bar at this value was not even yellow, it was just grey.

&amp;#x200B;

$me: *You see this? Just use the cable.*

&amp;#x200B;

$TL2: *I told you, we didn't break it.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr:

Crescent-Argonian,"A trip back to TaCo-mputerStore after a long while, an update and a fried motherboard","Hey everyone, the old lizard PC technician here after 2 years or so.


I should have updated you guys that about 2 years ago, I retired as a computer technician in order to focus on my career, which I'll be able to finish this December and improving my physical condition, which is still a work in progress but progress has been made!


So I bought through Sears an Asus laptop over a year at 2/3rds the price, it did give me a headache due to a faulty Ram stick, but the warranty fixed it for free, as much as it itched me to do it myself, fast forward the present day the motherboard fried one of the chips inside, not possible to repair since I lack the tools to do so, and with the warranty gone by now (12m, thanks Asus) I had to go back to my old place, the TaCo-mputerStore.


I stepped in and there were 3 people inside, my old boss, a new worker, and an old man berating him because his hard drive was formated and his programs were lost, apparently he was OK with that at first but suddenly wanted to blame us for not backing it up, which we do for a $5 usd fee he didn't pay.


In any case, my boss was happy to see me, 6 years working there and I rarely stepped in to say hello, not that I'm lazy, I guess I tried to separate myself from the trade.


We spoke, I gave him an update on my life, everything that's been going on, I can tell he's softened a bit, but still the same old man. 


So I explained him the situation with my laptop, and while it's possible he might have to replace the board, he said that he'll do his best to make sure it's fixed on mostly on the house, only asking me for almost half the price we charge for something like this.


And as for the new guy, well I couldn't really meet him since I had to go, but it feels good to go back, and that GeForce 5200 is still sitting on the shelf even after all this time, heh, some things never change do they?",talesfromtechsupport,944,1550438619
lawtechie,The inadvertent pentest...,"
  
I'm helping a small company move their infrastructure to the cloud as a part of a one week gig. Figured it'd be a simple job.
  
Turns out the sales person selling the engagement had nodded like a bobblehead when it came to add-ons that weren't communicated to me until the day before I was to arrive.  
  
In addition to helping them plan the cloud migration, I was going to do a security assessment of their cloud infrastructure as well as their offices. I curse the sales droid and start preparing report templates so I'm not pulling all nighters later in the week.  
  
I travel to the client's city. It's a warm Spring day, so I'm just wearing a suit without a coat to their office. I'm only carrying a small notepad as the client's insisting I use their equipment for any doc review. Fine.  
  
I'm walking to their office and hear more than the usual urban noise.   
  
Oh, shit. There's a drum circle outside the office building. And puppets. Seems like they're protesting the bank on the first floor.  
  
Or going to be, once enough people arrive. I happen to know some of the ""I do legal support for protests"" people in this town, so I look around for the [green NLG hats](https://www.nlg.org/legalobservers/) and introduce myself.   
  
me:""Hey, I'm sure you've got this handled, but if you need an extra pair of hands, I'm going to be right there (pointing at building). If you need my bona fides, I'll give you some names. Good luck today""  
  
Then my phone buzzes. It's a text from my client.  
  
Client:""Building under lockdown. Can we push to 10:30?""    
  
Bother. Great. I'm going to be working all night tonight. I wander over to the building. There are a bunch more security guards than I'd expect in the lobby. There are also a few 'plainclothes' security guards all wearing suits outside the building. Out of curiousity, I drift over to the clump of besuited security guards. They're having typical watercooler conversation.   
  
One guard fixes me with an angry glare.  
  
guard 1:""Where's your lapel pin?""  
  
I notice that the guards are all wearing small pins with the insignia of their employer.  
  
me:""I'm sorry, I didn't get one. Are there any extras?""  
  
guard 1 (getting on his walkie-talkie):""One coming in""  
  
Guard 1 jerks a thumb towards the doorway. I start walking. Once in the building, I'm waved past the security desk without showing any ID or even a word from me.  
  
I take the elevator to my client's office. I manage to salvage the time and make a finding on the first day. Luckily the rest of the engagement was pretty smooth. Most of their plan to forklift capabilities into the cloud was sane. They needed some minor improvements on their design.  
  
Of course, during the post-deliverable discussion, everybody wanted to hear just how I got into the building. I think I could have written the cloud stuff in crayon, for all of the interest.

willbeonekenobi,PC not powering on and I have no idea where the power button is!,"At the recommendation of a couple of users (  [u/vendennar](https://www.reddit.com/u/vendennar) and [/u/CMDR-Hooker](https://www.reddit.com/user/CMDR-Hooker)) who read my replies on another story on this subreddit, they wanted to know how I drove about 5 hours just to press a button. Bear in mind this story does take place about a decade ago and some details may have been a bit fuzzy due to drinking a bit too much at some points during those years. Also it is extremely long and I don't think I am a good writer.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to work for a medium to large IT outsourcing company in South Africa where we served clients ranging in size from 2 person operations up to country wide with 1000's of staff. One of the clients that we had was a large security company that outsourced security guards and 'high value courier services' for banks, casino's and other clients.  

Although our office, and the security companies head office, was based in Johannesburg, they had a branch we also had to serve that was just outside of Pietermaritzburg (4 to 5 hours drive depending on traffic and if you don't want to receive fines) where the security company would pay for us either to drive or fly down to that depot and spend a couple of hours there, a night in a guest house and return.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a Thursday before a long weekend which I was planning to drive to Durban and I had literally nothing on my schedule on that day so I decided to work one of the phones when I see that depot and company name appear on the display and the ringing phone so I answer.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me - Good day thank you for calling \[Insert Company Name\] my name is willbeonekenobi, how can I assist you?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Security guard - Hi there, when can you send someone out to have a look at my computer it wont turn on after a power failure. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me - Okay first things first. Can you verify that all the power cables are plugged in correctly and if there is power going to your office. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Security Guard - There is power, but only only thing showing is a message saying 'No signal Detected'. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me - When you checked the cables, did you see if the cables were going into a metal box with some other cables going out to that monitor?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Security Guard - The cables were being plugged into the desk, the desk I am using used to belong to {Old nearly blind manager of depot} that I had been given to use.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew this {Old nearly blind manager of depot} quiet well and I asked my brother (a carpenter) that I can integrate a pc for him to cope with his near blindness (which was caused by one of those cheaply made and dangerous laser pointers). He could still see bright stuff but not much else. I had a very big that had not only a glowing LED underneath it but it also had the, what I think is, globally recognised [power symbol](https://victussports.com/power-symbol-knob-sticker/). He was still sharp as a tack and still very much capable of doing his job but I think he was forced into early retirement (he was about 60 years old I think) and I personally had not been at that site for months.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me - Okay, if I remember correctly, you should see a large round button on the front of the desk. It has the globally recognised [power symbol](https://victussports.com/power-symbol-knob-sticker/) on it. You will need to press that button.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Security Guard - I did but only the fan comes on.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking, why would the fans be running and not the whole pc which could be a sign that there was a issue with the pc. I then ask the security guard to hold on while I talk to my MD about me driving down there and then afterwards go on my weekend break (we were planning to close the offices at 2pm and this was just before 9AM, and I was already packed and was planning to drive to Durban, which Pietermaritzburg is on the way, immediately after work. He says it's fine just save receipts for the claims. I tell the guard that I am on the way but will be there at about 1pm. I then get into my car and take a nice long drive and arrive at the site just after 1PM. I then see that guard was pressing a button to power on a Desk fan (which is separate from the desk) and NOT THE BUTTON THAT I DESCRIBED TO HIM THAT WAS INTEGRATED INTO THE DESK! Plus the button he was pressing clearly did not have the power symbol on it, but had a lightning bolt on it. I then power it on and show him which button he was supposed to press (this button was much bigger than the one for the desk fan). The pc powers on fine, I send a email to my boss (as we had received an instruction from the client head office that all calls no matter the issue must be dealt with immediately) saying what the issue was (guard not being able to determine what a power button is when they should know it). I then get the guard to sign the call off and I just sit around the depot with a cup of coffee for the rest of the hour (as we had to spend a minimum of 1 hour on the site (our company policy), then go on to Durban for the weekend for a wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

The next week I was roped into a conference call between my MD and the security company about this call along with that guard. The guard claimed that he had basic IT knowledge (just powering on pc, typing on keyboard, moving and clicking on mouse, etc) on his CV but when he was questioned about it by his manager's manager (that was also on the call but didn't hire him as he was recruited through a 3rd party) he said he didn't know anything. We then suggested that I teach him a basic skill course (1 day thing and would get a certificate) to which the company said no problem this will take place in two weeks time and he is on probation.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out I didn't get to teach this guard at all as 3 days later he was arrested by police after a 'Cash in transit' heist that targeted one of his companies vehicles and the drivers in the undercover vehicle recognised him immediately and had been apprehended when he got home WITH ALL THE MONEY!",talesfromtechsupport,812,1550330312
LineageOSLover,The mystery of the six-digit area code.,"Note: this story takes place in the USA. 
So one day a while ago, an older gentleman comes over to our tech desk with his laptop. He tells me the display cuts out occasionally. I check him in for a diagnosis, but as I'm entering his info into our system I notice something odd - his phone number is too long. I ask, (number has been changed) 
Me: ""Is this correct? (555) 444-333-2222""
Him: *points to the 555* ""Yep. That's the area code. It's my cell phone.""
Now, this is the local area code, but the second set of numbers is also an area code in this region. Suspecting a miscommunication, I ask for his number again, and he says it's 444-333-2222. I get him checked in, and after we finish the diagnosis and repair (display cable came loose) I call him and he picks up. I really do wonder why he used both area codes.

jkarovskaya,Irresponsible co-workers and unanticipated hell,"Some years ago I was consulting as a network admin/project guru for a college.

I had started there many years ago as a level 1 tech before going on to Sr Sys, then left for the corporate world.

Now I'm back doing various projects and triage coverage for sysadmins.


All the admins/techs were in the same area with office or cubes in a building on the edge of the campus.   They current top sysadmin was  in an office right next to mine, and I saw him rush out the door just before noon.

Thinking nothing of it, I""m still logged in working on a 365 admin process, when one of our professors walks in and asks me for help. 

Technically, I'm not supposed to do any level 1 because it's outside my contract, but we all know that ""other duties as assigned"" has a way of intruding on reality.  

Me&gt; Hi $Prof, what's up today

$prof&gt;  Oh, hello JK, I couldn''t find anyone else in the building, can you help our presenter with some computer things?  He's due to hold his presentation in 10 minutes in the #conference1 room, down the hall.

Me&gt;  Ok, just let me finish up here and I'll be over.  I check the COnfroom1 schedule, and see that my co-worker WHO JUST LEFT IN A BIG HRRY, was supposed to help this person due to previous arrangement, and that he purposely bailed. 

So I skip over to the ConfRoom1 and realize that the presenter has an old PC with no HDMI out.   He's not in the room yet, so I go looking for long  VGA cable &amp; adapter for the projector, and when I return I am introduced to the presenter.

He's an old gentlemen who can hardly walk, and he's *totally blind*

Our confroom  is NOT equipped for this at all, and I am having trouble getting video out,, but finally manage it.

His PC  is ancient (XP) has special software on it that requires pressing the TAB key multiple times to hilite a screen area, and the computer then reads him out loud what that item is, so he can press the enter key to run that function..

It's obvious we now need a pair of speakers as Bluetooth isn't present, and no HDMI, so my next job is hunting a pair of PC speakers, which requires a trip across campus.

Finally we think he's ready to go,, but then he asks how we will be RECORDING HIS SESSION so he can distribute that for his blog.

Me&gt; sorry  $Mr Blind person, we don't have that capability with our current setup.   

Bottom line, he's not happy that we are so far behind the times with tech support, and complaints are made to Dean of the College.

Crympt,Welcome to Hell: Part II,"**PART 2**

**Day 2: The shit-storm starts brewing (continued)**

As I said, the FSDO was NOT particularly happy with our assessment of this aircraft. Ultimately, the consequences of the decision to allow it to fly do fall to *TurBoss* and I, but this FSDO doesn’t seem happy with that. Our shop/repair station has the capabilities to do all of the things they’re unhappy with, but our shop is the one we’re trying to *get* it to, and nobody at this airport has any of the necessary (very expensive) equipment. Great.

Well, we figure the least we can do is service the oxygen and nitrogen. It turns out, contrary to what we believed, there *is* a maintenance facility on base here at *unnamed airport*, so we decide to pop on over to see if we can pay them for some of their precious N2 and O2. They don’t seem the most thrilled, but they lend us their N2 bottle. The O2 they say is down at another hangar, and is regularly used to service the ~~leaky-ass~~ perfectly fine oxygen bottle of that guys plane. We’re about to take the nitrogen, turn the regulator on just to ensure we have enough to get above the required ~2000 psi, and discover it is essentially empty.
Cool!

Meanwhile, the guy whose hangar the oxygen is at returns from wherever he flew to. We drive down there, ask him about the oxygen, and he states that he has none, has the local shop service it, and recommends going down there. 

Fuck this.

We inform *buyers* of what’s going on, and they find a local *gas store* to get our N2 and O2 from. Finally something is going ~~totally wrong~~ right. An hour or so later, *buyers* return with a bottle of nitrogen, and a bottle of oxygen. Welding oxygen. Now, gas isn’t super expensive, but when you’re buying a whole new canister, it’s not that cheap either. Taking advantage of *buyers* naivety, or simply not knowing enough about it himself, the *gas store* employee sold them the welding oxygen, uncaring or unaware to the fact that aviation grade oxygen is its own very special thing. Thankfully, we’re able to charge up the nitrogen, however we’re still SOL on oxygen.

We decide to return to the hangar where the oxygen is *supposedly* stored and see for ourselves if it’s there or not. Thankfully, the door is unlocked, however as soon as we open it, the alarm system the hangar **apparently** has starts beeping, so we immediately leave and go back to the local shop. They give us the key and alarm code, and we go commandeer an oxygen bottle, and after an hour of more bullshit, finally get it fully serviced.

Problems solved, right. Nah....

We go back to the hotel and spend hours getting and filling out the paperwork. The hotel computers won’t let us access the FAA’s website to get the forms, but eventually we get them and send them to the FSDO. 

This dude is *still* not having it. First off, he doesn’t answer his phone. We’ll call him, and he won’t ever call back, but a long time later he’ll email us. He’s still very iffy on giving us the ferry permit, so we call *bossman* to see what he can do. He calls OUR FSDO, has them talk to *this* FSDO, and eventually calls this FSDO himself. In an absolutely unprecedented sequence of events, *bossman* gets on a conference call with not one, but FOUR *feds* with the FSDO here. They continuously try to offer explanations for why they can’t grant the ferry permit, but *bossman*, with his decades of aviation experience and familiarity with the FAA regs, shoots down all of them. 

Now the FSDO wants their OWN mechanic to come out and check out the plane and the logbooks to ensure what FAA certified A&amp;P (airframe and powerplant- the certification for aircraft mechanics) *turBoss* is true.

That brings us to today. September 27th.

I’m also an aircraft mechanic, and wanted to share some stories of my own, however I didn’t think I had many worthy of dedicating a whole story to. Today that has changed! I’m writing this still in the midst of the hell of a shit-storm we’re in. 

Let’s begin.

Characters in this story:

*Crympt*: Yours truly

*Buyers*: The two people buying this airplane

*Seller*: The guy selling this airplane

*Bossman*: The owner of our shop

*The Feds*: The FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) representatives

Here goes:

I don’t even want to type this out because I’m so sick of even thinking about this bullshit, and I’m so mentally dead, but perhaps having people laughing with me at my suffering will help. 

**Day 1: Welcome to hell**

Our company was tasked with traveling out of state to perform a pre-buy inspection on a Citation (small business jet). Right off the bat SHTF. *Turboss* and I depart *airport*, arrive at *other airport* for a connecting flight, and then find out our flight has been delayed. No big deal. I have unlimited data so I’ll spend the time watching Hulu.

Our flight gets delayed again.
And again.
And again.^andagainandagainandagain

Finally they go ahead and cancel it, at which point we decide simply to change our rental car reservation and drive to our destination, as it’s only two hours away. During the whole drive we monitor what *would* have been our replacement flight, and see that get delayed and delayed, and finally cancelled at 9:30. Score. We made the right choice by driving. We check into the hotel, have a few beers, and go to bed, eagerly awaiting the easy money that is our few hours of work the next morning. 

**Day 2: The shit-storm starts brewing**

As expected, our inspections go off without a hitch. *TurBoss* and I meet *buyers* and *seller* at the hangar. We unload our tools and get to work performing our inspections. The airplane looks great. Sure it has 3 years of maintenance due, but from the few things we checked, it seemed to be in good enough shape to get the ferry permit to our shop. (A ferry permit is a one-time authorization from your local FSDO ((Flight Standards District Office)) to fly the aircraft to a location where whatever due/overdue maintenance can be performed)

We finish up in about 3 hours, then send off the FAA Form 8130-6 (for the permit) to the FSDO. *The Feds* **aren’t** happy with us.

They call and complain about several items. Uncertified transponders, uncertified airspeed indicators and altimeters, empty oxygen bottle (for emergency air), empty nitrogen bottle (to force the landing gear down if it doesn’t work for some reason). 
We don’t have the capabilities at *this* airport to resolve any of those issues, however we should be able to get a ferry permit regardless. This is an unusual experience for us, as back at home it takes a phonecall and 10 minutes to get a permit. Little did we know, that the shit-winds had JUST started blowing.

Selben,The Missing Intern,"**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**

&amp;nbsp;

**$Selben:** Me! “Technical Team Lead” previously Tier II ~~helldesk~~ helpdesk technician for a mid-sized company with a very skeleton-crew helpdesk. There were 10 of us total providing 24-hour coverage (not including supervisors) for 2500+ people company-wide.

**$Snickers:** My cubicle mate, also a “Technical Team Lead.”

**$BadIntern:** Intern2, still in college - got in due to a mistake. Previously called $Baddi, but name changed for clarification.

&amp;nbsp;

*Some of you may recognize parts of this tale, and that would be because it is an unplanned continuation of “The Goodi the Baddi and the Nauti.” Additional information was recently provided while reminiscing with ~~$Snickers~~ an unconfirmed source.*

&amp;nbsp;

$Snickers was checking his email and going through the normal office memos (meeting tomorrow, the ketchup needs to be refilled in the breakroom, a reminder to not take lunch meeting food with someone else’s name on it, set up a conference room next week for a video conference, etc), when $BadIntern returned to their shared cubicle. Having been missing at least an hour, $BadIntern tried to creep in, but $Snickers could see his reflection on his monitor. As $Snickers turned in his chair towards him, $BadIntern quickly put his hands in his unprofessionally baggy pants pockets, acting like he’d been there the entire time. $Snickers patience had begun to severely wear thin several days ago, when $BadIntern was re-assigned to his cubicle after repeatedly telling a female co-worker how nice she smelled (and other uncomfortable things).

&amp;nbsp;                       

&gt; $Snickers: Please, whatever you’re doing, just stop. Sit down.

$BadIntern thunked down into his chair.

&amp;nbsp;

$Snickers returned to his work. Within a few seconds, $BadIntern was playing with a wireless mouse. With a crack and a pop, a piece of plastic mouse shrapnel hit $Snickers in the back of his head. He spun around.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; $Snickers: STOP doing that!

$BadIntern had a look of confusion and shrugged. $Snickers rolled his eyes and glared.

&gt; $BadIntern: Huh?

&gt; $Snickers: Just… Stop…

This is where $Selben, temporarily in a cubicle nearby, observed $BadIntern choosing to do what any rational person would do in that situation, and threw the broken mouse over the cubicle wall. Fortunately, no other victims were hit.

A few days later, $Snickers was working and heard $BadIntern plop down in the chair behind him several hours later than normal. His heightened sense of smell insisted he inspect the situation as opposed to ignoring $BadIntern as much as possible. He slowly turned to see $BadIntern attempting to secretly eat a hoagie—the hoagie was half hiding in his sleeve—he froze upon being spotted. $Snicker’s stomach rumbled in response, but he ignored it and turned back to continue working. After a few minutes his senses were again hit with a similar, yet different overwhelming smell, and turned to see $BadIntern eating another hoagie, from his other shirt sleeve. $Snickers noted this one had bell peppers and onions and was definitely a different sandwich. Before he could begin his questioning, he was distracted by a call.

By the time the call was over (a branch lost email access…their internet was down), $BadIntern had disappeared yet again, leaving $Snickers slightly confused and a bit suspicious.

&amp;nbsp;

The next day $Snickers was on a break and chatting with $Selben while $BadIntern had been shuffled off to “work” with $Selben. He was playing with some ~~tweezers~~ zip ties and kept getting his fingers stuck. Suddenly $BadIntern looked up at what $Selben was doing and shouted out like a young child.

&gt; $BadIntern: OOOH! You’re playing video games at work! They said you can’t do that!

$Snickers paused and looked around. $Selben clearly had work on his machine. He had a website minimized with information about a game, but not an actual game. $Selben explained you can browse the web during your breaks if it is in moderation and work safe. $BadIntern seemed a bit perplexed by this but slowly nodded after pondering it over for several moments.

&amp;nbsp;

Soon after, $Snickers was nominated to train the interns on a new process he had created. He was only able to locate two of them, with $BadIntern missing again. After a brief search he gave up. Rather than crowd everyone into his two-man cubicle, he opted to take the interns into a conference room. They entered the darkened room and flipped on the lights. With a loud bang, $BadIntern jerked up and hit his head on the table he had been, apparently, asleep under.

&gt; $Snickers: Were you sleeping in…

$BadIntern ran out of the room.

$Snickers looked under the table and found a blanket, a cell phone and a small pile of crumbled sandwich wrappers. After a more careful inspection he saw different names on the wrappers and recognized many of them as people from different parts of the office.

It was explained to $BadIntern that the “free sandwiches” that he had “found” were not, in fact, for him. He was reprimanded, and food for staff meetings seemed to go missing less often. $BadIntern was caught napping in the conference rooms several more times and was warned he would lose his internship if he kept it up. He seemed to stop but would still randomly disappear at times.

A few weeks after his internship ended (which he did complete), a janitor made the discovery of “the nest” in a broom closet. He found the exact same blanket from the conference room and a large collection of snack wrappers. Fortunately, it didn’t look like it had been used recently.

$Selben looked over at $Snickers, who was starting to turn red with anger, when they heard the news.

&gt; $Selben: It’s okay, he’s gone now. Breathe.",talesfromtechsupport,898,1537999773

I ask for the computer number as we have that many and I start walking towards the computer where the lady is seated. Let's say it is number 314 for geeky purposes. Something in the back of my mind knew there was something wrong with that computer, I had a feeling that I got an earlier call for it, but I couldnt recall it fully. 

Anyway, I pick up a new keyboard from storage just so I dont have to walk back and forth constantly and I head towards this lady, confident that I will fix this problem and be called ""smart"" for changing a keyboard. 

I arrive and suddenly I remember. Computer 314 had a broken ethernet cable which needed to be replaced, but we for some reason had none laying around (often times people ""fix"" stuff themselves, unaware that we like to keep track of our storage). So to clarify that it was broken it had a note on the keyboard saying ""broken"".

This lady sat down there and thought only the keyboard was broken. Fine, not sure why you don't just pick another computer then, but okay. She actually grabbed the keyboard from computer 313 and moved it over to her computer. No unplugging the keyboard from 313 and plugging it into 314, no, she just moved the thing over. 

She just moved the thing over and expected it to work.

Well the German lady was having problems with her phone (she could call or text anyone, the service said emergency calls only), so my Grandma, who views me as some sort of tech wizard because I can connect her phone to the tv, said that she would bring the phone home to me and that I would try fix it.
I get home from school that night and my grandma asks me to have a look at it, so I decided I would just pull the SIM card out and then put it back in... and what would you know, it started working fine, but I was sort of frustrated as I was tired and had a big assignment due the next day and wondered why someone else couldn’t have done it, but that was the last that I thought of it.

Then the next day when I get home from school, my grandma tells me that she took the phone back to the German lady and that she was really appreciative and then she points to the kitchen bench where there is a nice chocolate cake cake sitting there. 

Apparently she had thought I had done the greatest thing in all the world and it made me so happy because I literally did the smallest thing but she thought was the greatest thing and how easy it was to make her happy. I just wanted to share that.",talesfromtechsupport,689,1537939344
Skirrak,Hotel Wi-Fi shenanigans part 3.,"[Part 1 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9h7544/hotel_wifi_shenanigans/).

[Part 2 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9i2e1o/hotel_wifi_shenanigans_part_2/).


Got a call last night from a woman asking if we could fix their network and internet.  She had gotten a glowing referral from the person she and her husband had bought a hotel from.  As soon as she said that my warning bells went off.  

I confirmed her address/hotel name and no surprises its the infamous hotel I just blacklisted.   I explained a little bit of what had happened and she embarrassingly admitted that was her husband.  Soon to be ex husband specifically, she apologized, offered to pay the last call out and also pay me again to fix the network.  She promised he wouldn't be on site or need to be contacted on the phone and would pay the base call out fees in advance.

Against my better judgement I went out this morning early to look at what happened.  Before I started work I had the lady sign our paperwork, pay the last call out plus a retainer for the work she wanted us to do today.  She asks me to tell her everything that happened in detail.   After I was done she apologized again profusely and explained that her and her husband started a divorce in the middle of buying this hotel but it was too late to back out.  He never really wanted to buy it and she was getting the hotel in the divorce.  He was pissed he had to manage the hotel for month and stopped paying bills as some sort of power play on finances.  They had already lost their biggest housing contract for the hotel and a good portion of the long time staff. 

So then I go look at what he had done. Nothing as bad as I might have expected.  Everything was just unplugged so people would stop complaining about the internet not working.  It was a simple matter of plugging everything in and testing connections.  Then the lady got trained on the equipment along with the front desk person I worked with last time.

She did tell me to call the police if he started harassing us again and that he wasn't supposed to be involved with the hotel at all ever again.  

So happy ending I suppose?  The whole story feels a bit sadder with the full context.  I hope she can turn things around.",talesfromtechsupport,2054,1537897028
Slackmastergeneral97,We all love execs don't we?,"Execs that don't care for technology are just the best aren't they? I work for a manufacturing company where I stand as their only form of IT support. I am the IT department for multiple sites.

Today I had to deal with a couple execs, lets call them $exec1 and $exec2.

I get a call at 9:00am this morning about a label printer not working at a different site to me. Fair enough, I start to pack my things to go over straight away (no label printer means orders can't go out on time). As I'm packing my stuff, $exec1 approaches and tells me that I need to come and help him set up his laptop in the boardroom *right now*. I tell him there are instructions in the room on how to do it and to call me if he gets stuck, as I have to go and deal with something at a different site. He straight up refuses and basically orders me to do it. I agree as I know it will only take a few seconds to plug in a cable and I can be on my way with little to no fuss.

Fast forward a few hours later, both execs now in the meeting. I am on the phone to an MSP about fixing another printer that has stopped working. #ILovePrinters. Suddenly $exec2 storms into my office. ""Slackmastergeneral97, i need your help, come quickly"" I tell the MSP I'll have to call them back, drop everything and follow him into the kitchen. ""We need to lay this food out in the boardroom for the visitors."" Are you f$$$ing kidding me?! It wasn't even a lot of food, he could have easily done it himself. What a joke. I now have to go and call MSP again and sit through another 10 minutes of hold music because he couldn't be bothered to carry one extra tray of food.

Fast forward another 20 minutes later, I am now on the phone with a user at the other end of the site, trying to walk them through a fix, when this time $exec1 storms into the office and says ""One of the visitors can't connect their laptop to our screen, I've tried and it's not working, come and help now"", again I drop everything, tell the user I'll call them back and go and see what I can do. $exec1 goes to the toilet on the way to the boardroom so I go in alone. There were two key things that I noticed were wrong with the set-up. First of all, the TV in the boardroom wasn't even switched on, how on earth they didn't figure that out before I don't know. Second of all, it looked like the $exec1 had been trying to plug the mini displayport cable into the usb port on the laptop, surely you should be able to match up the cable end with the socket right? Clearly not. I plugged it in and away they went.

The meeting started at 10:30am and isn't scheduled to finish until 4pm. It's still only 1:30pm. Lovely.

Of course, all of these issues are part and parcel of being an IT Technician, but it's really sucky that people won't try these things themselves or will abuse their power to get everyone to do simple things for them. It's just annoying that they crap themselves during meetings because they haven't prepared, and then blame you for their lack of preparedness.",talesfromtechsupport,1192,1537881433
OweH_OweH,Removing the old homepage,"Working in the IT department of a University can be very ... special on some days.

Normally I do infrastructure stuff, server administration, etc., the equivalent title would be ""Senior Systems Engineer"", but in times of need I also man the 1st level helpdesk.

In comes an eMail:

Mail from student:
&gt; Hello,   
&gt; I need to delete the shitty homepage I made for a course. Please help me.

Answer:
&gt; Hello,  
&gt; please provide your username or your matriculation number so we can verify your account.

Mail from student:

&gt; I am no longer a student, but my username was $oldusername. Please delete the homepage, it is embarassing me.

Answer:

&gt; I can see your account has been automatically deactivated 6 months ago and the homepage was already deleted at that time.

Mail from student:

&gt; But I can still see the homepage! Please delete it for me.

Answer:
&gt; I can assure you, there is no homepage left on our servers. Please describe what you do, when you are able to see your old homepage.

Mail from student:

&gt; You clearly are incompetent and don't want to help me. I will send an email to your superior to get this taken care of.

I shrug internally and close the ticket. Not my problem anymore. But deep inside I know what will happen ...

Mail from boss to me:

&gt; Here is a mail from a student needing support to get his/her homepage removed.

I merge the new ticket to the old ticket, and start over again:

Answer to student:

&gt; I can only assure you again , there is no homepage left on our servers. Please describe what you do, when you are able to see your old homepage.

Mail from student:

&gt; Fine. I go to Google, then I type in my name and then it shows the homepage.

(Funny how the google search bubble works. When I typed hin her/his name into Google, I didn't get his old homepage on the first two pages, for him/her it seemingly shows up as first hit.)

Answer:

&gt; Dear Sir/Ma'am, we at $uni don't control the contents of the Google search engine. All your data including your old homepage has been removed from the servers at $uni. Any remains or traces of them in external services like Google are beyond our influence. 

Mail from student:

&gt;That is absolutely unbelievable, I demand that you remove my homepage from the Internet!

Answer:

&gt;Dear Ma'am, Sir, there is nothing we at $uni can do here. If your homepage is still listed in the Google Search results, you need to talk to Google to get this removed.

Mail from student:

&gt; NO! You provided the homepage, you need to remove it, I demand it or I will sue $uni!

Answer:

&gt; Dear Sir/Ma'am, I am going to refer this ticket to our legal adviser, you will hear from her in the next week about your options in this case.

I move the ticket to the queue of our legal department and hope to be finally done with this. Thankfully, this time this was the case.

The last thing I heard was that the problem solved itself after another 3 weeks because Google removed here homepage from their index.

Please don't take me out behind the barn and shoot me just yet.","So Here I am, 23 years in IT, predominantly as a Systems Administrator and Project Leader for 2 Large companies. I've worked with pretty much every type of technology for a business environment imaginable. 

Alas it was not my day today. I've worked extensively with MFP's from Xerox, Canon and Ricoh etc. Someone set up a new Canon unit in our office a few weeks ago. Today I needed to scan some documents so that I could Email them. I head over with a stack of pages and insert them in the document feeder then press the directory button to find my Email address. I then set it to duplex and save as PDF. (The interface is pretty intuitive considering I'd never used this type of MFP) so I find it to be not difficult at all. I then press the big green Copy/Send button... Nothing happens. I try resetting the paper, the email address and settings, Nothing... I'm at it for like 5 minutes straight retrying everything that I can think of. Arrrgh...

Someone else sent a print job to it while I was standing there so the printer wasn't frozen or anything.

So the new guy who was able to escape 1st level support and join our team has worked with this new printer type before. We go through all the steps, nothing... again...

He then just nonchalantly turns it off and then back on... Of course it works now... first time. Now why didn't I think of that?

I thanked him and kindly suggested that he not have me taken out behind the building and have me shot. :)

adams071,User tried to login to office 265,"Hello all you beautiful folks! Long time lurker here! So to preface the story here, this just happened about an hour ago. A user got a phishing email saying that there is a PDF fax ready for them on SharePoint and gives them a link to office 265 to login to get it. 

Now on to how I heard about this and almost had a heart attack. The users that I work to support are all old farts that work with the Government and Military, meaning that they are wickedly book smart but NOT TECH SMART. 

A ticket came in from offending user asking if the email they got is a phishing attack. What sets the cheery on top is that the user included in the notes that they had the email in their inbox FOR A FEW DAYS AND CLICKED ON THE LINK. ONLY JUST NOW LETTING US KNOW THAT THEY ""MIGHT"" HAVE A PHISHING EMAIL AND TRIED TO LOGIN TO IT.

That immediately set off ""holy shit"" alarms in my head, knowing that a user accidentally gave a potential attacker a way in to our network. What's worse was that it was done DAYS ago so who knows if the attacker even got far. Thankfully we have MFA enforced at login. So at this point I changed his PW and sent an email to his supervisor regarding the incident.

ZappBrannigansLaw,We don't need AC in the server room.,"This happened a couple of years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I started working with a new company as their network admin. Nothing huge, but a couple hundred devices, a server room with 4 physical boxes hosting and backing up a dozen virtual servers, and a couple of outlying network closets. The server room was below grade, with the top 5 feet above grade, and on the outer wall of their building.  This building is located in Wisconsin where temperatures can range from -20 ° F to over 100 ° F with the relative humidity ranging from almost nothing to over 60%.

&amp;#x200B;

One day I hear from $maintenance that the $CEO wants to cut energy consumption in order to help the bottom line. No big deal, right? It turns out that $CEO's big plan was to cut a vent in the outer wall of the server room, shut down the AC unit in the colder months, and save all kinds of money by not having to run the AC for that room year round! I immediately called $CEO about the matter and made it very clear about how bad of an idea this would be. Not only for keeping the temperature constant, but also humidity.  I also explained that the slight cost in not running this less than 10 year old, high efficiency AC unit would be greatly outdone by having to replace this equipment. Nothing like some condensation building up on your nice expensive VMWare server hardware, modular PoE switches, nice router, etc. Thankfully $CEO saw reason and I never heard about it again.",talesfromtechsupport,2849,1537417361
Skirrak,Hotel Wi-Fi shenanigans.,"I've been doing the IT work for a local hotel for almost 13 years.  The hotel has changed owners 5 times in the 13 years with the most recent owner taking over this last year.

The fourth owner decided to use ""their IT people"" to install access points to provide their hotel customers Wi-Fi.  Something I had been recommending to the third owner for years.  The competing company only installed two access points for 50 rooms that were very spread out.   The worst part?  They weren't wired, basically two glorified Wi-Fi extenders for an entire hotel.

They started getting 1-star reviews saying that their internet was garbage.  The competing company was fired, and they called us to fix it all.  I recommend a proper setup with multiple wired access points to cover each area of the hotel.  They didn't like the price and would only authorize wiring the two access points they currently had and had us throttle each connection to 500k downs.  

I had them sign off on the work with clear warnings that this will not solve their issues and people will continue to complain but the owner didn't seem to care about online reviews.

During the process of changing from the fourth owner to the fifth owner I came in for consultation to give the new owners a rundown on all the IT systems and where the fourth owner stored passwords etc.  During the meeting the fifth owner asked if there was something we could about all the 1-star reviews online about the internet.

I showed them the bid I had given the fourth owner with updated prices for hardware and they both agreed it was time to do it and would split the cost.  

Finished the job and it was working perfectly, however I made a stupid mistake and never got the new owners to sign off on the work.  Surprise surprise they refused to pay their half, saying it was the fourth owners issue and not theirs.  We went back and forth, and it ended up getting a little nasty.  They finally told us to come out and remove half the equipment, they would get by with half the access points.

I warned them that would lead to terrible internet for their customers, but they didn't care.  Went out, took out half the access points which looked like garbage because we aren't fixing holes and tucking cables if they won't pay for our labor and left.

A week later they are calling us frantic because they are getting 1-star reviews that the internet sucks and are about to lose a large contract because of it.   I gave them a new emergency bid at 3 times the original labor plus labor for removing all the access points and demanded they pay for the original install labor.

They begrudgingly agree, and everything is back up and running as it was when we originally finished the job.  In the end their labor cost went from around a thousand dollars to almost five thousand.  

I wonder if the 6th owner will use my company too.",talesfromtechsupport,2433,1537377826

Undercover_CHUD,"I can read it to you, but I can't comprehend it for you","Had to do a hardware deployment for Onboarding the other day. Usually is a quick indicator for who our  ""frequent flyers"" are gonna be.

Everyone gets an Onboarding sheet that has all the new user info necessary:  
 \- username  
 \- email  
 \- SSO site  
 \- temp password and complexity requirements

We bring our computers along for the odd ""special user"" that  will end up needing a reset before leaving orientation. I wish this was  about one of them. 

This lady puts the temp password in, sees the ""you must reset"" and just sits there.  So I wait a few minutes and start walking around the room to see who hasn't made it in and asked her if she needed help.  She didn't know.  I tell her that she will need to reset her password so click where it says OK (almost verbatim to whats on the screen).  So she puts a personal password in (doesn't meet requirements) and neglects to put it in the ""verify password"" section and clicks OK.    


""You're new password and verify password fields did not match""  


I tell her to click OK and we try again.  I specify, you need to put the password in twice which ensures that it's been typed correctly.  She does this, but this time she doesn't put the old password into the top field as it's cleared when you fail to reset.  I try to stop her but she clicks OK anyways.  


""You're Old Password was incorrect""

&amp;#x200B;

Rinse and repeat, we try again.  She's getting frustrated because of course she is.  This time her password doesn't meet complexity requirements.  So I point to the guide sheet and say:  


Chud:  You're going to want to make sure that your password satisfies these requirements.  I'd recommend adding a special character like an exclamation at the end if you have trouble coming up with a brand new password.  


EU:  Umm my password does satisfy those requirements.  It's not working.  I don't know why it's not taking it.  


Chud:  Ok, I understand.  Would you please try again?    


\- You're Password does not meet length or complexity requirements -  No action from the end user.  


Chud:  I'm going to have to recommend you try again with a longer more complex password.  


this time it goes through.  I count my lucky stars and hope that it's a fluke and that if she's this bad, she also is too bad to figure out the ticketing system (no dice)

BONUS:  

an hour goes by and ""I can't print"" ticket comes in from her.  We have secure printing so I already know the issue.  I go to her desk and of course, when she was prompted to set her PIN she just clicked wildly until it went away and we had to reset it.  I explain why this is necessary and see the glazed blank stare.  I get it, IT's not people, I am just a dispenser of function for machines.  Essentially a Waiter who serves functionality.  

What I don't get is how people will see a pop up and just click anywhere and everywhere to get it to go away \*OR\* just throw their hands up and give up.  If you don't know, read.

krystof1119,We want a new tech support guy please!,"Hi TFTS, first time poster, also on a phone, so don't judge me.



I'm actually a student, so I don't carry stuff on me like a tech support person, but this time, I was called in by a teacher I know in a school I used to go to. I had the day off, so I though I might go there and fix whatever is going wrong. I arrived and was greeted by tons of friendly faces.

$Me: Hey $Teacher, I'm here. What's wrong?

$Teacher: The internet is down, could you take a look?

$Me: Sure, one second!

I sit down at the first desktop I see, fire up Chrome and open google. Everything loads.

$Me: I don't see a problem, are you-

$Teacher: Oh no, it only happens on laptops! And I'll also say, it's been happening for about 20 days, ever since $Contractedtechsupportguy repaired our printer. He changed the toner.

$Me: Aha! Let me look.

I look at the first laptop in view and see that it has an IP. I fire up Chrome and am greeted by a ""No route"" error page generated by the router. I try logging in, but the default password doesn't work, noone knows the password and the $Contractedtechsupportguy is nowhere to be found.

$Me: OK, it seems like I'll need to perform maintenance on your router. Where is it?

$Teacher: Oh, I have no idea.

I pull up a wifi analyzer app on my phone and find the wifi AP by comparing the dbm in different places.

$Me: Hey $Teacher, come with me. I don't want an incident to happen and me to be blamed. (Incidents are way too common here).

After 1 minute of orientating myself in (half of) their WAY TOO COMPLICATED networking setup, I see the problem. The WAN ethernet cable is connected to a networking switch that every wired computer is connected to, but the cable from the switch to the AP is gone. Not there. Absolutely gone. I also notice there's a new, sealed AP on the teacher's desk. I tell $Teacher to remind $Contractedtechsupportguy about it, but now for the temporary fix.

$Me: I'll need to go home to fix this.

$Teacher: Oh it's ok, you don't have to make up excuses, you're not a student here, go whenever you need.

$Me: No, I'll fix it, but I really need to go home now.

I get home (it's a 2 minute walk) and grab the only ethernet cable that's sitting unused. It only has 2 pairs of wires but it'll do. Once I get it, I sprint back.

After explaining why I'm back so soon, I go to the AP, get out my yellow cable (all the others are white), plug it in and it works. Since it's only 100Mbit, I tell the teachers to request a new cable from the $Contractedtechsupportguy whenever he gets there. He gets there in 2 days, changes the printer cartridge (yes, it ran out in 22 days) and replaces the cable. I get told to get my cable, I do that, everything works, everything is great. End of story.



Or at least, in theory.

In reality though, I get called in about a week to help them with internet again and I have no idea why it just stopped working.

$Me: Hey $Teacher, what's wrong now?

$Teacher: No computers downstairs have internet, save for the laptops. (Those use wifi)

$Me: I'll look, but I probably can't fix that one. I'll see what I can do though.

$Teacher: Oh, one more thing, the $Contractedtechsupportguy added a little thingy here. What is it?

$Me: That's a switch, $Genericswitchdescription. Thank you for pointing that out, it might help later.

I look at the infrastructure downstairs. It looks pretty simple, one CAT5 cable from upstairs and two switches, of which I only found one at first. I check with a borrowed laptop and sure enough, I don't get an IP. (MAC address filtering is not a thing, nor are domains) Static IP doesn't fix it.

$Me: I don't think I can fix this, sorry.

$Teacher: Bummer. Can you fix the directors PC though?

$Me: I don't think so... I can try though.

I walk into the office and look at where the ethernet cable goes. Sure enough, I find the second switch and it has been... unplugged?

$Me: Aby idea who did this?

$Director: Nope, no idea. Could you plug it in?

I look around and find it hidden 2 meters from the switch. I plug it in and the computer suddenly has internet. But I am curious.

$Me: Your computer's working. But now I want to know why the other won't.

I try plugging the WAN cable from the switch into the PC and BOOM, INTERNET! Turns out two of the ports on the switch don't work. I report it and go. Everything has worked so far.

Also, I got a job offer from them! They literally said ""We want a new tech support guy please!""

moonchild165,Our VERY IMPORTANT drug room PC doesn’t work,"Okay so you know the drill. LTL FTP. 

Started my career in IT about a year ago after leaving uni and landed a job in the Healthcare sector last December. 

I love my job and my team, it’s also on the same site as my girlfriend that happens to be a nurse at the hospital I work at. Naturally this means that any problems the ward has, I tend to deal with.

Fast forward to last night and we’re laying in bed. I’m having my nice unwind talk with her about work when she turns to me and says “one of our drug room computers isn’t working”.

Now for any of you that don’t know, the drug room computers are the only PC’s on the ward that you can track and issue drugs from. If one of them breaks, it’s a big deal.

So I reply to her saying “oh, what’s happened?”

“Well I tapped on to the reader* and the screen was just black”

(*i should also note that most wards are equipped with card readers that allow users to quickly tap their smart card and be logged on to a virtual machine) 

I go through the usual troubleshooting.

“Any error messages?” “No”
“Any flashing lights on the card reader or machine?” “No”
“... was there a light on the power button?”

“No”

FUUUUUU-. 

I ask her how long this machine has been out of action and she says about 5 days. I kindly ask her if she knows of anyone that has tried to turn the machine on or logged a call with IT. She replies “no.”

At this point I say to her “please try turn the machine on when you’re in tomorrow. If it’s broken I will log the call for you and send someone out” 

TODAY I get a text from her saying and I quote:

“Btw that broken machine in the drug room... it was switched off”.

I understand that nurses are busy but just press the on button! If it’s broken after that then sure, leave a note and report it when someone is free!

I’ll add that before this I’d mentioned to everyone in the office that I’ve taught my missus to be ‘very tech savvy’ and ‘she’d be really helpful when logging a call’

He says iI must have went to the wrong house because him and his girlfriend have been home all day.

My options at this point were to turn around and go back to his house or set up another appointment and hope he's actually there that time. So I decided to go back.

pinky0926,This is what working in tech support does to you.,"Had an issue with my car not starting last night. I tried lots of different things to get it working, nothing worked. I eventually threw in the towel and decided to get it across to the mechanics this morning. 

The mechanic absolutely pissed himself laughing when I showed up this morning with a 3 page document detailing all the technical specifications of the car, when I bought it, how far I had driven it, when exactly it had stopped working, every bit of maintenance I had performed in that time, a picture of the fuse box with arrows pointing to the ones that I had changed, the precise method I had followed to try and start the car and finally a VCDS scan of the car's computer with the fault codes printed out. 

Apparently that doesn't ever happen. The good news is he was able to sort the problem out pretty quickly. ",talesfromtechsupport,659,1537206346
flippedalid,I connected my email accounts together but I don't think I've been getting company emails.,"I work tech support at a Real Estate Company and we provide email addresses for the Realtors with our company name on it. Last year we switched from a trashy pop mail server to gsuite. In the middle of that, we allowed Realtors to forward their email to a personal account if they set it up themselves. (see where this is going yet?) 

I get a call today from $NG (nice guy):
$NG: Hi $me, I connected my $company email to my personal roadrunner email and I think I stopped getting the $company emails. 

I get a lot of people say they ""connected"" their emails together but they really mean they forwarded one to the other. So, I look-up his account and it says the last login was 12 months ago.. I'm thinking, surely this guy didn't just realize he's been without company emails for an entire year. I'm thinking maybe something happened and it stopped recently.

I ask if I can login to his account and he says sure. So, I reset his password and login as him to check the settings.

First thing I see? About 1800 unread emails dating back to August 2017.. The same time we switched to gsuite. 

I go into the forwarding and amazingly, it's set up correctly...
But it wasn't enabled.

So I enable it and that was it. 

I can't fully comprehend being without company emails for an entire year without noticing (we send out a not-so-subtle amount of emails/leads every day). I don't mind working with these Realtors because the majority of them are super nice and thankful but sometimes I wonder how they made it this far.

lawtechie,Security theater of the absurd...,"
I had just started in the security practice of a consulting firm and they put me on delivering a penetration test against fnordco, a diversified company in the Fortune 200 range. They hadn't suffered a big breach, but a competitor had recently made the news and they didn't want the splatter.   
  
As some kind of trial by fire, they make me the project manager, but don't give me access to useful documents or the team for a few days. My days are spent nudging people via chat and email for _anything_ that might help me get up to speed. Finding the internal directory useless (everybody is an engineer, from sales people to consultants to internal IT), I resort to LinkedIn to find the pen-testers at the firm. People who do respond refer me to people who don't. 
Day 3, I get a chat-channel invite and a marketing brochure describing our bespoke pentesting methodology.   
  
It reads like someone sprayed superlatives into the list of Qualys (a popular vulnerability scanner) options. With the meaningless eyewash graphics and diagrams, it's a menu from an Applebee's in Burrough's Interzone. It's horrid, banal and familiar all at once. I don't know a lot, but I don't like what I've experienced so far.    
  
About ten minutes on the group chat with the team doing the test and I'm not feeling any better. I get the scope of IPs and applications we're testing and a brief description of the process. 
  
The project is almost done. I'm told the scope has already been given to the various pentesters, so I was going to do the writeup along with the 'read-out' or explanatory meeting with the people at fnordco.  
  
I get a bunch of spreadsheets from the testers. Something's wrong. These don't read like penetration test reports- there's no description of the actions the tester did to exploit the vulnerability or what they were able to access. Instead, there are entries describing _possible_ vulnerabilities.  
  
It hits me- this is just vulnerability scanner output, not an actual pen test.  
  
I raise hell in the group chat and get referred to Rufus, the sales rep who sold this engagement:  
  
me:""I don't understand what we're selling here. Every pentest I've worked on, we actually tried to see how far we could _penetrate_ their systems.""  
  
Rufus:""We're not doing this here?""  
  
me:""No. We're scanning their surface and logging _potential_ vulnerabilities. We're not validating that the systems or apps are actually exploitable. We're not attempting to get shells.""  
  
Rufus:""That's what we call a tiger team exercise or special pen-test. Fnordco didn't want that. Just do what the client wants.""  
  
me:""I see we're using special vocabulary. I'll adjust expectations. Thanks.""  
  
I started writing up our findings, but decided to start looking around to see if I could find something to convince fnordco that they needed to take this seriously.  
  
Things definitely didn't get better, but they did get more interesting...

HeadacheCentral,"In Dev land, noone can hear you scream...","Or : That time when the scream test **didn't** work

Preface : I'm the head of IT for a medium business. My staff consists of exactly two people - me and one minion - to handle some 1200 staff and contractors spread around the world. I do pretty much everything except write code - they pay squirrels to do that.

My VMWare environment was getting - tight on resources. A plethora of recent requests for VM's for various purposes had left things in a mess, and I'd had enough of it.

I decided to do some clean out. I **knew** exactly which guests were production - so I didn't touch those - but dev machines...oh, those Dev machines!

How do I know? We've got a pretty nifty naming scheme for VM guests. It's basically city-site-shortfunction-purpose

So a production machine might look like

blah-headofc-adfs-p01

Which would tell me this server is located in Blah, at head office, and is the first ADFS server in the farm.

Dev servers are created with the extension ""d01"" or just ""dev"".

So I traipse merrily through the server farm most at risk of resource exhaustion, find some Dev servers I know are in use (current product, under active development), some I was pretty sure were in use (previous product, still in support), and some where I just went 'Whiskey. Tango. Foxtrot?""

So I shutdown a few of the WTF servers for a [Scream test](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scream%20test) to see is I could get rid of them. Short term gain in resource availability - I got quite a bit of CPU and memory resources back on the farm, and all was right in the world.

Fast forward three weeks. I have heard not one scream along the lines of ""Headache, you useless mongrel, why is XXX app not working anymore?"", so I go ahead and prepare for physically deleting these machines.

Now, I'm a paranoid old fella, so I made sure I backed up the machines completely before I deleted them from the VMware system. Rule number 1, right?

Fast forward **another** 4 weeks (7 weeks total from shutdown), and I get an email

""Hey Headache, $APP server is not responding anymore. Can you have a look at it?""

I've got **no** record of any such app. Never heard of it, never seen it.

Do a little digging into DNS and other records, and find there *is* a CNAME for this app in the corporate DNS - pointing to an host record for an IP which doesn't exist.

Something about the hostname rings a bell...Hmmm, where have I seen this before?

blah-headofc-randomname-d01

If you're following along, dear reader, and guessed that this was one of the servers I deleted - have a gold star.

Dig a bit more, and find out that $APP was written by a previously employed dev who was not only mostly useless, he was also somewhat of a hot dog - he'd requested this dev server for something completely else entirely, and just chucked this app onto it while he was at it - **and** then gone ahead and told corporate they could move it **into fscking production** from the dev server.

What happened to the scream test, I hear you ask?

Turns out this app is **only** used by maybe three people - and only once or twice every couple of months. They hadn't used it for the entire 7 weeks - so never noticed.

Lucky for me, I was able to restore the server **and** get the app moved onto a server which was actually flagged production and more suited for it - but only because of my belt and braces attitude to nuking servers from orbit.

And that, boys and girls, is how I learned all Devs are bastards. :-)

TL;DR Dev with a penchant for hot dogs moved uncooked wiener onto bun for sale, resulting in stomach aches for all concerned.",talesfromtechsupport,953,1536887373

KitsuneExistISwear,“We’ve never needed internet to use email!!”,"So I work as a tech at a place that fixes computers and phones and also sells them used. It’s a pretty good gig but sometimes the customers can be a wild ride.

Older customers are hit or miss. Some come in having worked with computers since their inception and others come in not knowing anything about their own devices because someone else set it up for them. This customer falls into the latter category.

An old man, with cane and massive computer box in hand, comes to our door and I rush to open it for him. He’s very thankful and comes in and says he might have a virus. I tell him that’s something we can help with and pull the computer out and set it up on our intake bench. I ask him what the issue is (Me = Me, Older Gentleman = OG):

OG: Well it has to do with my email. I’m getting duplicates of these just AWFUL messages that I never asked for! And my wife has to see them too!

Me: Okay! Let’s take a closer look here!

I open his email app and he tells me to navigate to his junk mail box. 

OG: See! Look there’s five or six of the same messages from the same sender. It’s so strange we’ve never had to deal with this before!

Me: This is really just junk mail, sir. It’s also called spam because these companies get your email from somewhere and just spam you with messages over and over. It’s why you have a junk mail box so you don’t have to see it and can just dump it.

OG: Oh that’s never been there. The virus must have created it!

Me: No sir, I assure you that is an existing feature. These duplications may be a WiFi issue or an issue with your email provider.

OG: What’s WiFi? We’ve never had that before! Is that part of the virus too?

Me: No sir, I don’t think you have a virus. And you would have to have WiFi or internet in order to use your email.

OG: No! I’ve never had to use internet before. We’ve never had to use internet for our email!”

Me: If you’ve never used WiFi then you must have had a wired connection. Internet is essential to use your email.

OG: No it is NOT! My son would have told me about it when he set it up!

It suddenly dawns on me that this is the source of our struggle. He doesn’t know anything about his device is set up other than the passwords he needs to use it.

I then had to take the time to explain to his man what internet is and how it allows him to use email in as layman’s terms as possible so that he could be convinced that it wasn’t a virus. After he was reassured that junk mail is normal, adjusting his settings, and telling him that his WiFi will automatically connect when he gets home he was on his merry way and I was....so confused. How can you use a smartphone and a computer and not know what internet is?!?

TL;DR : The internet is a virus.",talesfromtechsupport,650,1536767298
JimmyReagan,Urgent! Escalate! Panic!,"So the other day it was my turn to be the weekend ""on call"" guy for our support line. Company policy is that every department have one. My particular department provides support in Cognos, BI reporting software. There really isn't any scenario where there's a business critical failure that can't wait till Monday, it's even stipulated in their contract. Very occasionally someone will open a case with our department that is important but belongs with another group.

So I get a call around 5pm on Saturday from our call center, a case that's marked with the highest urgency possible and set to escalate to manager. Usually I'll reset the urgency if it's nothing...but the description made it sound like their entire system was down, which is actually a big issue.


So I excuse myself from my friends and make a call to the listed number. I reach a manager who tells me he's not at the office, but they're in the middle of a software upgrade so he figures one of his employees opened the case. Now he's asking me what the case says and what the problem is and blaming us for halting their business. I tell him he was the first call I made, if he gives me a number I can call someone actually at his business.


Now I call the number the manager gave me. It's actually the number for one of our internal customer relationship liaisons who are on call always. Now he's asking me what's wrong and emailing my manager and telling me we need to get this fixed. I keep repeating I don't even known what the issue is yet! So now he's trying to find me someone to get ahold of.


Next is our project manager for the upgrade...a grumpy guy who sounded like he was already halfway buzzed on his weekend...then the company's project manager that just went to voicemail...back to the CRL who is fully panicked...my boss texts me asking WTF is going on...and I still have no damn clue.


Finally the first manager I called adds a note to the case with the number of the person that opened the case...along with more posturing and threats...so I call the number.


This fuckin guy...we'll call him FG.


Me: &lt;company&gt; support, we got an urgent case about &lt;catastrophic failure&gt;, what can we help with?


FG: Oh well the project manager said our reports wouldn't work during the upgrade, I just wanted someone to call on Monday to help me check that everything was working again. I didn't think you guys would even call!


Me:....well you described a serious issue with your system, is everything OK? I can transfer you to our emergency support to get things running again.


FG: oh no everything is fine with that. I'm using it right now!


Me (screaming internally): you opened the case as urgent and escalated to management, are there any work-stoppage issues that need our attention?


FG: oh I didn't know. I don't think I opened it as urgent. You guys can call me Monday I need to get back thanks! &lt;click&gt;


Just to note...it takes multiple clicks and several confirmation messages to both mark as urgent and escalate a case...so he's full of shit. After picking up my jaw off the floor...I re-prioritize the case as ""low"" and CC everyone I called on an email explaining everything...that there is no issue, their system is fine...and someone ""accidentally"" prioritized the case...


On the plus side my boss paid me for the hour and a half of calls and nonsense...the manager at the business apologized...and that case mysteriously closed by Monday...


TL;DR: All systems down, but not really so it can wait till Monday.",talesfromtechsupport,620,1536760918
Ghoste7,The type of screw up that lawsuits are made of,"  

So this started yesterday and we are still working to get it fixed.

tl:dr is that a technician with our SAN vendor screwed up and now our SAN which hosts our entire virtual server farm has no cache.

So the players in today’s story are:

$me – desktop support tech and junior sysadmin who originally found the problem

$admin – server admin in charge of the data center. Works remotely from a different state

$manager – Server admins boss and person who basically built the entire enterprise network and server system

$SAN\_tech# – several different SAN techs that we talked to. All of which had very thick accents.

Here begins our ongoing tale of woe.

So I work at a small state university. Primarily I am a tier 2 technician but I also manage a lot of the more desktop focused server systems like SCCM and our VDI infrastructure. About 2:30 PM yesterday I get a call from the help desk saying that people are having a lot of issues with the VDI so I jump into action and start looking to see what’s up. I check all the basics, like are the servers running, have any of the services stopped, etc. after establishing that everything in the VDI environment seems to be as it should I call over to $admin and $manager so that we can start digging deeper. As we look we start to notice that a lot of our servers and management tools are running really sluggish. I finally see some alerts in our network monitor saying that most of my VDI servers are having long disk queues and higher than normal disk usage time. I mention this to $admin and $manager and tell them that if our storage is bottle-necking then that would account for the issues that I am seeing in the VDI. At this point they mention that they had a drive issue on the SAN earlier that day so we all turn our attention to the SAN.

At this point I should add that we pay a good amount of money to our SAN vendor for maintenance and that one of the things they are supposed to do is contact us if we have a drive fail. We have not heard anything from them. As $admin is looking at the SAN management console he sees that not one but two drives have failed and they are both SSDs used for caching. Ok, time for a call to support.

$SAN\_tech1: Thank you for calling $SANSupport how can I help you.

$admin: yes we have two failed drives on our production SAN please help us.

$SAN\_tech1: ffasldkjfjrl;kj lrkjaljker alkjsdrl;jaslkdker lkajrsd;r lkj

$admin: I’m sorry I couldn’t understand you could you say that again?

$SAN\_tech1: asldkfjasl;kdjf lakjds;fjalk;sdfj ;laksjdf asdjf ;lasdfj 

$admin: still couldn’t understand you. You have a very thick accent. Can you try one more time?

$SAN\_tech1: asdlfkj;lk;jasdlk;fj webex dot com lak;sdjf;lkasdjfla;sdkjf

$admin: I am sorry I can’t understand you I am going to have to call back and get a different technician. \*hangs up\*

\*calls SAN support again\*

$SAN\_tech2: Thank you for calling $SANSupport how can I help you.

$admin: yes we have two failed drives on our production SAN please help us.

$SAN\_tech2: ok lets start a webex and I will take a look. 

(Dude was still hard to understand but not quite as bad as the last one)

$Admin: ok \*joins the webex\*

$SAN\_tech2: ok I do see that you do have two drives that are showing as disconnected can you reseat them?

\*$manager goes to the datacenter and reseats the drives\*

$SAN\_tech2: ok the drives are still not showing up. You should have spares can you replace these two drives since they seem to have failed.

\*$manager and $me dig through the storage room to find the drives and then replace them\*

$SAN\_tech2: Ok I see the new drives showing up in the SAN. Now I just need to do a couple more things to finish up.

At this point an hour passes as we watch $SAN\_tech2 do what seems to be very little as our cache drive pool still shows as being down.

$admin: hey what up? Are you still there? Can we escalate this so that this gets fixed quickly. At least 90% of our environment runs on this device so it needs to be fixed fast.

$SAN\_tech2: yes I will get my supervisor involved. 

After about another 30 minutes $SAN\_tech3 gets conferenced in.

$SAN\_tech3: Hello $SAN\_tech2 tells me that you are having some issues with your cache drives.

$admin: yes and we need this fixed as quickly as possible.

$SAN\_tech3: ok well it looks like what happened is that the replacement drives that you plugged in were added to the wrong disk pool so to fix this we are going to have to ship you a temporary SAN, migrate all your data to it, rebuild your existing SAN from scratch and then migrate the data back.

$admin, $manager, and $me: WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU HAVE GOT TO BE JOKING!!!!!!!!!!!

$SAN\_tech3: we are sorry but it looks like when $SAN\_tech2 was adding the drives to the pool he put them in the metadata pool and they can’t be removed from that pool without corrupting all data on the SAN.

After arranging the details of what could be done with $SAN\_tech3, $admin, $manager, and $me started shutting down non-critical systems and migrating critical systems to our DR site to reduce the load on our crippled SAN. They are overnighting us a couple new SSDs that we will switch our hotspares for to get some cache back onto our SAN until they can get us an engineer and a temporary SAN to actually fix the problem that they created. 

As you can imagine coming in this morning after working until midnight to a still broken SAN and no word on the new drives is making today a fun day.  ",talesfromtechsupport,1358,1536757660

TechKeeper,The Day I Saved a Wedding Reception,"Hey everyone - STL, FTP, all that good stuff. I was just reminded of a story from a few years ago and thought it would be a good one for my first post. So, without further ado - here's a tale of how I once saved a wedding reception.

My wife's cousin got married a few years ago. They were trying to do the reception on the cheap, so they asked me to do a photo slideshow (I previously worked at a small local TV station, so I have a video editing background). As an additional cost-saving measure, the groom's dad was the Emcee/DJ for the wedding.

My part of the reception went without a hitch and I thought I was done for the night, so I had a few cocktails. Well, I was wrong.

The ""DJ"" equipment consisted of a rented board, a couple of speakers and a personal laptop. Fast forward past most of the important reception items (first dance, etc.) and people are dancing around, generally having a good time. All of a sudden, we're nearly deafened by scratchy, skipping-type noises coming out of the speakers.

The groom's father was hurriedly trying to get the issue resolved. He tried another song, which started fine, but then the same thing happened. This happened 3 or 4 times, the sense of helplessness on his face increasing each time. He had no idea what was going on or how to fix it.

Before I know it, I'm approached and asked to figure out what the issue is and get it fixed. I, of course, agree. Have you ever had hundreds of people staring at you waiting for you to miraculously fix an issue on equipment that you've never touched before? I have and I've never sobered up quicker in my life.

The first thing I notice is there's an external hard drive connected to the laptop (I bet you can see where this is going). I poked around a bit and figured out that the music that was skipping was all being played from the external hard drive. I tried power-cycling it, checking connectors, etc. which obviously didn't help. A little further digging and I confirmed my suspicion - the external drive was on it's way out at a most inopportune time.

I was able to locate some music on the internal laptop drive and played songs from there to keep things flowing, then copied as much as I could from the external, until it completely died. Finally, I set up a new playlist to use only songs on the internal drive, so the groom's dad can take back over.

It was probably the most stress I've ever felt doing tech support, but I didn't pay for a drink the rest of the night!

TLDR; Dad decides to DJ his son's wedding, stores most of the music on an external hard drive, which predictably dies during the reception. I save the day by setting music to play from the internal laptop drive and recovering any files I can from the external.",talesfromtechsupport,1285,1536590212
HappyDaCat,Photos &gt; Safety.,"LTL, FTP, etc. I'm a programming student who lives their parents. As such, most tech support in the household falls to me. This happened earlier today:

&amp;nbsp;


Me: A risk-averse student.
Mom: My mother, taking photos for eBay.

Mom: ""Hey, check it out! My phone makes a gurgling noise when I set it down.""
Me: ""Huh, lemme see.""

My mother set the phone down, and it obligingly made a soft noise that sounded like bubbling and hissing. Alarm bells immediately went off in my head: Phones aren't supposed to make that noise, and the most obvious suspect was the battery, which was bad news.

Me: ""Mom, I need you to gently set the phone on the table.""

Mom, setting the phone down: ""Why's that?""

Me, gingerly picking up the phone: ""There is a chance that there is a problem with the battery. Worst case scenario, it could explode and spray flames and toxic fumes all over the room. I need to take it outside, and then look up the problem.""

Mom: ""What!? NO!? Give my my phone back, I'm taking *pictures*!"" At this point, she starts trying to wrestle the phone away from me, and I have to put myself between her and the phone.

Me: ""No. I'm taking this outside.""

Mom: ""Well then you had better take a picture of that before you go!"" She pointed at a folded t-shirt that she had been in the process of photographing.

Me: ""No. What part of ""spewing flames and toxic gas"" did you not understand? I'm taking it outside until I can figure out what's wrong.""

&amp;nbsp;

After the phone was safely relocated outside, we both set about researching the problem. It turned out not to have been a battery issue, but rather an issue with the camera. As the phone was set down, the table came closer and closer, causing the camera to attempt to re-focus on it, making a noise that sounded similar to what you might expect a battery to sound like before failing when you shifted it's orientation.

Still, I don't understand why anyone, when told that the object they were holding could poison them and burn them at the same time, would respond by demanding to retain possession of said object.",talesfromtechsupport,1412,1536539809

User: So, ever since you guys set up my VPN, I can't connect to *Intranet Site*.

Tech: Are you connected to the VPN now?

User: I think so.

Tech: *Attempt to find the user's computer on the network*.  Hmm, I couldn't find you on the network.  Are you signed into *our instant messaging service*?

User: No, as I said, I can't get on any intranet sites since you guys set up my VPN.

Tech: The *Instant Messaging Program* doesn't require intranet.  Can you try signing in on it please?

User: It says it can't connect.

Tech: Can you open your browser and try going to a web-site like [news.google.com](https://news.google.com) or something?

User: No, nothing's working.  I haven't been able to use the Internet since you guys set up VPN.

Tech: When you open *VPN Client*, does it have a button that says Connect, or Disconnect?

User: It says Cannot Connect to Service.

Tech: It seems like a problem with your home internet.  Are there any other devices that connect to the Internet in your house?

User: Yes, I have an iPhone.

Tech: Is it connected to your WiFi?

User: It can go online.

Tech: Is it going online through your cellular service or your home WiFi?

User: I don't know, how can I tell?

Tech: Is your phone's WiFi on, and if it is, what is the name of the network it is connecting to?

User: I don't know what you're talking about, but it goes online.

Tech: If you go to Settings, and then WiFi on your phone, what is the name of the WiFi that it's connecting to?

User: Oh, it's not connected to anything.

Tech: If you turn on your WiFi does it connect to your home's WiFi?

User: I don't have WiFi.  I was told I would be able to use the VPN to connect to the network.

Tech: How does your computer connect to the Internet?

User: Through the VPN that you guys set up for me.

Tech: The VPN allows you to access the company's intranet.  You still need an Internet connection to connect to the Internet and through the Internet, VPN tunnel to the company's Intranet.

User: So you're telling me, I still need to pay for Internet to connect to the Internet?

Tech: ...Yes.  

User: Well, that's just great.  I canceled service and took the modem and CPU back to *ISP* over the weekend.  Now you're telling me I have to get that all back?

Tech: Yes, you'll need a connection to the Internet to connect to the Internet, and the Intranet through VPN.

User: Then why do I need the VPN?  Isn't the VPN giving me a connection to the Intranet?

Tech: Yes, over your connection to the Internet.

User: You're not making any sense.  If the VPN let's me connect to the Intranet, why do I need the Internet.  Just connect me to someone who knows what they're doing.  Give me the Network Team.

Tech: You still need a...

User: I don't want to talk to you anymore.  You're just a bottom level tech who will be replaced by automation anyway.  Give me the Network Team now!

Tech: I've escalated your ticket to the Network team as you've requested.  What's your phone number so they can call you?

User: *Audible sigh* 123-456-7890.  Are they going to call me right now?

Tech: I'm escalating your case now, they'll call you as soon as they are able.

User: You obviously have no idea how networks work.  Did you just graduate?  How can I make sure that the survey I receive about this service accurately reflects you?

Tech: In the comments section, you can call me out by name.  Was there anything further I can assist you with at this time?

curtludwig,Sorry you lost your data...,"A few years ago a customer came to my attention that was on a ""hand grenade"" version which had a known bug that WOULD cause data loss if left alone long enough. I called and suggested that the patch would take just a few minutes to install. They told me to take a hike, they weren't upgrading and wouldn't give us any more money. I explained that I didn't want any money the upgrade was free and I'd gladly walk them through the upgrade for no charge. They said they weren't interested in upgrading and hung up on me.

About a week later I called again and they quickly told me to ""Stop calling"" and hung up.

Another week goes by and I send an email. In the email I include the URL for the patch and detailed instructions on how to apply it. The email started with ""You will lose data if you do not follow these steps"". In a few hours I got a reply to ""Stop emailing us"".

Finally another week goes by and I send a certified letter that is basically a cut and paste of the email. A few days later I get an email ""Don't send us anything, stop contacting us, leave us alone.""

Great, I filed that all away knowing it would be useful one day.

&amp;#x200B;

It was about 2 years later I heard through the grapevine that the customer had lost all their data. It had happened at a particularly bad time (doesn't it always?) and they were suing us for damages. So I took a walk down to see our general council. I'd met the woman before but didn't really know her beyond coffee machine talk. I tapped on the door and said ""I think I can make your day but its going to cost you lunch."" she seemed skeptical but agreed to lunch and I produced a manila folder with my call log, copies of my emails and the replies, the receipt for the certified letter and a copy of their email reply.

Lunch was really good...",talesfromtechsupport,2697,1536267585

Arrived to work at 9:00 as usual and few minutes after I received call from Lady that never used our services before. By the sound of her voice I guessed she could be around 50 years old. She had one simple question: How can I find ""How to make Apple Pie"" on the Internet. 

Sounds okay, lets educate this Lady on how to use google!

**$ME:** So firstly you will have to open your Internet Browser - Which could be Edge, Chrome,....

**$LADY:** I don't have anything like browser at home.

**$ME:** Well browser is piece of software that would allow you to browse websites on your computer. 

**$LADY:** I don't have computer.

**$ME:** Uh... Ehm... Do you have Smart phone/Mobile phone?

**$LADY:** I have my landline, Is that any good? 

**$ME:** I'm sorry Mrs., With all respect, Did you ever used Internet or Computer itself? 

**$LADY:** No, Just my friend keep talking about that and she gave me your number to call for help. 

**$ME:** I'm sorry but the Computer or smart device is essential to browse on the internet and you might find it difficult to work with technology if you never used it.

Slackmastergeneral97,14 hour long shift - unexpected.,"I work as the 1st line of IT support for a manufacturing company in the UK. (There is external support if I cannot fix something). I  am the only on-site IT guy for three sites, so as you can tell, life is hell at times.

Anyway, this particular tale happened about 1 year ago, when I was going into my second year as a techie. There were plans to decentralise our servers, a project that was being handled by our external it support and my **$Boss** the head of finance. This would eradicate our need for an extremely out of date Citrix environment. I was too inexperienced at this point to handle the project. So an External IT Engineer **($EIT)** was needed. Here's how the day panned out.

\- **8:30 am (Friday)** : Arrive at work (expected 5pm finish).

\- **9:00 am** : Phone call from **$Boss.** ""Server decentralisation is happening today, you may have to work a little later, ***couple of hours tops***""

*Thanks for the zero notice. No plans tonight so not a problem luckily.*

\- **9:30 am** : Warn users to turn off pc's before leaving today.

\- **12:30 pm** : Users leave. (They work a half day on Fridays, lucky gits.)

\- **1:00 pm** : Transport all relevant servers to correct site, and put them in place in the server room

\- **2:00 pm** : Check all PC's are powered down of course only about 50% of the users listened to my warning. **$EIT** engineer is expected to arrive at 2:30pm.

\- **3:30 pm** : **$EIT** arrives, 1 whole hour late. 

*It's definitely not going to be a couple of hours tops.*

\- **3:45 pm** : **$EIT** begins shutting down all servers that were already in use and says he wants to spin them up all together, as I help where I can. I think he wanted to migrate some VMs to another server. Get to know **$EIT** a bit, he's actually a good guy, and a superhero when it comes to IT. It was clear I was just here to lend a helping, yet limited, hand.

\- **5:00 pm** : Phone call from **$Boss :**

**$Boss -**  ""I'm leaving for the day, I trust you and **$EIT** are nearing the finish?""  

**$Me -** ""Not even close, hopefully in the next couple of hours though.""

**$Boss -** ""Well as long as it gets done, that's all that matters"" *Click.*

*Yeah don't mind me and* ***$EIT***

\- **7:00 pm** : **$EIT** and I begin spinning up the servers, reconfiguring them.

\- **9:00 pm** : Last server being spun up, I can almost taste the freedom.

*I spoke too soon.*

\- **9:30 pm** : Server does not spin up correctly, doesn't allow user log-on, and will not communicate with the rest of the network. **$EIT** tells me to go and make a drink for us both, he'll try something and spin it up again.

\- **10:00 pm** : The server spins up, we carry out some test to make sure everything is working, finally done, we can go home. **$EIT** is an absolute hero.

*I spoke too soon. Again.*

The front door is locked. We're still trapped in this hell-hole. Have to call building maintenance to come and let us out. We're both so tired and near raging at this point. 

\- **10:30 pm** : **$EIT** and I are finally let out. Completely exhausted. We shake hands and part ways to go home and get some well-needed sleep, I have never seen him since. 

Fortunately, when I arrived into work the following Monday everything worked fine, and was greeted by my boss telling me I can take the time back that I worked extra (basically a full day) and that I could have an extra days holiday that year. Every cloud....

swimfast58,A story about tech support at Sony,"I hope this fits, although it's from the perspective of the user. Reading about Sony finally discontinuing their PS2 repair service reminded me of one of my favorite stories my dad tells, about Sony's ""repair service"". Also on mobile so forgive any formatting or spelling errors.


Back in the 1980s, my dad played basketball for the New Zealand National Team, and travelled all over the world for games and tournaments. On this occasion, he was in Tokyo for a big tournament. While he was there, his fancy new Sony Walkman (the original) stopped working. He set out to find an electronics store, which, being in Japan, couldn't be that hard to find. The only complicating factor is that he didn't speak a word of Japanese. 


He first went to the concierge at his hotel, who luckily spoke a few words of English. He explained his problem and the concierge seemed to understand, responding by writing an address on a card: ""go here"". My dad took the card and showed it to a taxi driver, who drove him through the streets of Tokyo before pulling over at his destination. 


He paid his fare and then looked around to find the electronics store... Only there wasn't one. There were plenty of opportunities for miscommunication and he nearly resigned to going back to the hotel. Then he looked up... And up, and up, to a big sign on top of the building in front of him: ""SONY"".


He had been sent, surely with all the best intentions, to Sony Headquarters. He laughed, but was fairly that they would not have a repair centre inside. However he decided, in a last gasp effort to save his Walkman, that the reception inside might speak more English and might be able to direct him  somewhere more useful. He walked in and explained his problem, thinking he might get another card with another address. Instead they asked him to wait and made a phone call in Japanese, which lasted a minute of two. Feeling a bit embarrassed, he started preparing to leave, but suddenly receptionist got up and walked him to an elevator, pressed the number for a very high floor, and then left the elevator before the doors could close.


So here is my dad, very confused at this point, alone in an elevator rocketing up to the highest floors of Sony HQ. The doors open to an empty hallway with several unmarked doors. Again, he waits a minute of two, and right before he can abort and go back down, a door opens and three small (they were probably normal sized, but everyone is small to my 6'9 dad), Japanese men wearing lab coats, pop out from a door and come over to him. They take the Walkman from his hand and start examining and discussing it, then disappear with it back through the door, closing it behind them.


It suddenly dawns on him, and, if it hadn't already, you: this isn't any sort of repair centre. This is the bleeding edge. This is Sony R&amp;D, on the highest floors of one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo, Sony HQ. These guys don't just build electronics, they design them! And they're fixing my dad's Walkman. 


Now, we Kiwis are a very understated people (except when in comes to rugby) and the fact that he ended up here, wasting the time of some of the smartest people in the world so that he can listen to his new AC/DC album, is both bewildering and incredibly embarrassing. But at this point it would be even more rude to leave, so he sits and waits while his walkman is fixed by the guys who probably invented it.


Eventually they come out, waving his walkman and excitedly showing that it now works. He pulls out his wallet, but through the language barrier, they make it very clear that they will accept no money. So he thanks then profusely, goes on his way with a story he, and I, and maybe now you, weil never forget.",talesfromtechsupport,3950,1536071457

miscreancy,"""It could be worse, this could be a company machine""","Another tale from my days working for $GiantSupermarketChain on their helpdesk.

Your cast of characters (inspiration from Pratchett, this time):

**$Miscreancy**: A dashing ne'er-do-well, now fairly experienced at working in tech support for this company

**$TheBeanstalk:** One of my team's seniors (I was a junior) - really knowledgeable guy, and also ridiculously tall and skinny.

**$Vetinari**: An InfoSec analyst. Ruthless character. Deftly manipulated and/or threatened people into doing things his way. I rather liked him.

**$MrTeatime**: This story's 'customer'. An ~~interesting~~ ~~annoying~~ ~~slightly scary~~ character who seemed to delight in coming up with new and interesting ways to break stuff, cause trouble and give our InfoSec guys heart attacks.

​

The tale begins!

*So this was while I was manning the help desk for $GiantSupermarketChain - we were first line support for all IT issues that didn't relate to POS. My team ($Office) handled office-based colleagues, as opposed to the $Stores team that handled - you guessed it - colleagues based in store (those were the worst kind of calls). We also had responsibility for handling all calls related to $GiantSupermarketChainBank, whose colleagues were convinced they were the most important people we would ever speak to in our day, regardless of grade. Sometimes, though, the worst calls you get are from people who work in Tech...*

​

\[Phone rings\]

**$Miscreancy**: Good afternoon, you're through to $Miscreancy on the $Office team, how can I help?

**$MrTeatime**: Hello, it's $Teatime here, from $Department. My laptop has been acting up, I was hoping you could take a look?

**$Miscreancy**: \[inwardly groaning - this is not my first tango with $Teatime\] Sure. Do you have the machine name, or an IP address?

**$MrTeatime**: \[Rattles off an IP\]

&amp;#x200B;

I ping the address and confirm that I'm getting a response from it - so far so good. Get into it using Remote Assistance - excellent. Now I'm in and I can already see that there are a few problems here in terms of what the machine looks like, but I'm going to assume as this is a machine belonging to someone in Tech, someone may have given them admin access. Still, this doesn't look like our standard 8.1 image, and... is that Steam installed in the corner there? If this is a dev laptop and not just a tech one, we won't support it at all. Curious.

I check for a specific piece of software that all of our machines have installed... nope, it's not there.​​

&amp;#x200B;

**$Miscreancy**: Hi Teatime - so it looks like this machine is going to need to be rebuilt regardless of what the problem is, because it's drifted so far away from the base image I have concerns about you continuing to operate it. So I'll get an appointment for you for the swapout while it's being rebuilt. Could take a couple days though, so lets try to get it functional in the meantime. What's wrong with the machine?

**$MrTeatime**: Core MS apps aren't launching. could be a problem with the registry? It's getting some funky errors.

&amp;#x200B;

I take a look through and he's right - try to launch any core Office app and it fails out. Again though it's weird because it's a version we haven't released yet. He tells me he got a beta version which I can understand except... he also doesn't have a licence key and I've just found a cracker file. This copy of Office is bootlegged. Oh no.

&amp;#x200B;

**$Miscreancy**: $Teatime, when you say this copy of Office is a beta copy, where did you get it from?

**$Teatime**: I mean it's an official MS Beta from 4-5 years ago that got leaked. Ohhhh, did you think I meant internal beta?

$**Miscreancy**: \[desperately trying to hold temper\] Yes. Because this is a company machine and you can't install bootleg software on it! You could get us in serious trouble!

**$Teatime**: What are you talking about? This isn't a company machine!

**$Miscreancy**: \[pole-axed\] ... eh?

**$Teatime**: This is my machine. I just got $HardwareSupportTeam to get me bound to AD so I could use the network. I'm on a whitelist of something I don't know, didn't want to have to use a machine I couldn't properly control so I brought in this one and told them that it had been approved by $InfoSecTeam.

**$Miscreancy**: And was it approved by them?

**$Teatime**: I mean I have an email somewhere that explains it. \[finds email, which authorises the use of a machine on our network for a single day for a specific purpose, and stipulates that the machine must be completely clean and contain no threat to our security\]

**$Miscreancy**: Did you not see the part about it being for one day, it needing to be clean and no threat?!

**$Teatime**: I figured someone authorised an extension cause it never stopped working. Don't sound so worried, it could be worse, this could actually be a company machine.

&amp;#x200B;

Ohhhhh no.

Oh no oh no oh no.

So what this means is a machine with 0 corporate oversight that has bootlegged software on it, being operated by a colleague who doesn't have any security knowledge or experience, has been roaming free on our network for... however long. I throw a quick query at $TheBeanstalk and he runs over to take a look.

&amp;#x200B;

**$TheBeanstalk**: ... eh?

**$Miscreancy**: Yeah, this looks like combination idiocy. I can reverse the bind $HardwareSupportTeam did and I reckon we can get this fixed for now but... we need someone from $InfoSecTeam in on this. Who do you reckon?

**$TheBeanstalk**: We don't really want to touch this with a barge pole but I guess we'll have to. Grab $Vetinari, he's usually good at making people regret bad decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

That's pretty good advice. I give $Vetinari a quick call, but to be honest most of what he said were four letter words about $Teatime. He's going to speak to his boss, $HardwareSupportTeam's boss and $Teatime's boss, then shoot me an email asap. In the meantime I'm given the rather blunt instructions to 'get it the \[%\^£@\] off our \[%\^£@\*()\] network before I go down there and \[%\^£@\*()\] smash it into a million \[%\^£@\*()\] pieces', which is refreshing.

&amp;#x200B;

**$Miscreancy**: Okay, so here's the deal $Teatime. We have to nuke your machine from orbit, which is my way of saying we're booting you off the network effective immediately. This will prevent you connecting via wired and wireless networks within our offices. Feel free to tether it to your phone or something if you need connectivity, we're just not going to communicate with the device.

**$Teatime**: Well this is outrageous! Honestly, I call because I'm having issues with Office and you end up removing my perfectly functional machine from the network. You're overreacting! I want to speak to your manager!

**$Miscreancy**: I have no doubt you'll be speaking to a number of managers very soon. Yours is currently on the phone with $InfoSecTeam, if I'm correct. And your machine is now off the network. I can't put you through to my manager, because he's currently on the phone to $HardwareSupportTeam.

**$Teatime**: To try and get my machine rebuilt?

**$Miscreancy**: No, to find out who added the machine for the network and didn't check the machine thoroughly or put a time limit on it. We won't be rebuilding your personal machine or issuing you a replacement. Or having it anywhere near our network again.

**$Teatime**: I don't understand how I'm supposed to work in this environment without a working computer.

**$Miscreancy**: I'm sure you'll figure something out; unfortunately these are my instructions and as it's a security issue I have to follow it to the letter. Your ticket number is ###### and someone from $InfoSecTeam should be in touch.

\[ENDCALL\]

Needless to say, his worry about working in that environment was now a non-starter as after 5 days he didn't have a job with us anymore. I got an email from $Vetinari later that day to confirm that someone in all three teams ($HardwareSupportTeam, $InfoSecTeam and $Teatime's team) had messed up in different ways, which compounded our issue into the ridiculous scenario we were in. To make it worse, the machine had slowly been spreading some nasties to other devices, which prompted a nice wave of machine wipes and security update rollouts.

kayakmainac,A UPS test! During peak time? The day before a massive event?,"LTL/FTP

So I work in IT services for a university in the UK, there was a network outage for all internal IT services including the phone system (which is great! Our quietest couple of hours that week!). We were given a eta for all services to be back to normal operation which was ~2 hours after the outage started which we then informed the users of. 

Initially we were told that there was a power outage at one of our ‘data centres’, later on that day we were informed that a UPS test had been conducted that day and had subsequently failed brining down EVERY server that we had on site! 

The worst thing about this is it had been approved by management, with them knowing that the clearing was the following day! (The clearing is A level results day and is a massive day for universities). I can’t see another UPS test happening during regular working hours again 😂",talesfromtechsupport,657,1535836203
Bl4ckX_,My new laptop beeps every few minutes!,"I work for an MSP and this story happened to a colleague of mine about 2 weeks ago:

&amp;#x200B;

We got the CEO of a company set up with a new notebook. As he was the CEO it was nothing standard but something quite expensive. After he had the machine for about two days he called us and complained about his new laptop making a beeping noise every few minutes. My colleague took a look on the device via Teamviewer but couldn't find anything suspicious. Since the customer kept complaining he tried everything from driver and bios updates to system updates and application removals but nothing seemed to help.

After trying everything my colleague decided to take a look at the machine in person.

After arriving in the CEOs office he looked at the seemingly fine working laptop and suddenly there it was. A beep. But that didn't seem to come from the laptop. He looked around and noticed something on the ceiling: a smoke alarm with a battery nearing the end of it's lifetime.

&amp;#x200B;

The CEO was pretty embarased that he didn't notice the noise coming from the smoke alarm. But he took it with humor. 

After the battery was switched out, everything remained silent and no more beeping came ""from the new laptop"".

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: CEO get's a new laptop and complains about a beeping noise coming from it. It turned out that it was a smoke alarm with an empty battery.",talesfromtechsupport,2077,1535804775
YouSayToStay,How the FBI destroyed my company’s computer,"Obligatory “First Time Poster” start goes here. Hopefully my formatting is good! This is a bit long, but hopefully it’s worth the ride! (Due to length, I left out some of the standard troubleshooting steps to save time.)

Setup: One of my previous positions was as in-house IT for a Fortune 100 company at the corporate headquarters. We had our own in-house call center and I was part of the hands-on support team. When the company first brought me on, my main work was doing PC builds/replacements (on a three-year cycle), none of which was automated. Users were used to a certain level of service, so not only did I have to run all updates, copy data (Oh did I miss Windows Easy Transfer when they upgraded to Win10), and other standard fare for a build, but we also made sure the taskbar was the same, printer defaults were set, etc. For certain VIPs, we even made sure the desktop icons were in the same order. Again, there was no automation in place so this was all done by hand, for a building containing around 900 people. 

Between builds I would assist the other hands-on techs with the ticketing queue which was everything from “I need batteries for my mouse” to “set up file backup systems for the company and teach everyone how to use it”. Luckily the queue was left for us to pick items to our strengths or curiosities and we made sure to keep things pretty even. We had a ticket come in for a user in our Communications department that I got along with well with that I decided to pick up. The ticket was essentially “My computer keeps crashing”.

\---

Cast:

**ME**: You know, the guy with the pants.

**CU**: Communications department User

\---

&gt;**ME**: Hey CU! I heard you were having some PC issues!  
&gt;  
&gt;**CU**: Oh hi! Yeah, my computer is really slow! And when I try to save files, sometimes everything on the screen just disappears!  
&gt;  
&gt;**ME**: Well that’s…different. Mind if I take a look?

CU lets me hop onto her computer, which is a pretty solid machine designed to make sure all of the Adobe Suite is able to run with ease. After making sure all important work is saved I start closing windows, only to come across the DESKTOP FROM HELL. The user has three screens, all of which are COMPLETELY COVERED with icons. So much so, that the icons are stacked on top of each other THREE LAYERS DEEP.

&gt;**ME**: Wow, so you keep just a few things on your desktop, huh?  
&gt;  
&gt;**CU**: Haha, yeah I just save everything there, it’s an easy spot to remember.

I spent a little time at this point talking about #NewBackupSolution we were using and how now would be a good time to clear out unnecessary files while she transfers everything to the backup system while I was attempting to recreate the issue. Sure enough, when I would try to navigate through Windows Explorer, it would crash and never recover, leading to a hard reboot of the machine. 

&gt;**ME**: Well, this is definitely a problem. Let me see what I can do for you here.

At this point I ran through a bunch of cleanup tools we used regularly, attempting to free up space, remove programs that hadn’t been used in a while, run any and all available updates, etc. It was a long ride on the struggle bus with Explorer crashing from time to time, and in the end things were no better off than when we started.

&gt;**ME**: Well, unfortunately we are still looking at the same issue. You’re not due for an upgrade, but it looks like you don’t have an SSD and so I’d like to update you to one of those. This will also let me get you a fresh Windows installation which I think will take care of things for you, but it means I’ll need to take your machine and set you up with a loaner.  
&gt;  
&gt;**CU**: I actually have a laptop for when I’m travelling, and I can totally work off of that until you’re ready.

Awesome! I hike up my slacks and get the tower disconnected and haul it to the IT Room to start cleaning up. The old drive is removed, a new SSD is installed, the device is imaged, software is installed, and the user is logged in. No more crashing, awesome! But now it’s time to transfer that user data. All \*checks profile size\* 100+ GB of data that is only on the desktop. Woo!

I start the backup to my external drive while I’m working on other things, keeping an eye on it to make sure there aren’t any failures. Luckily, everything goes through without a hitch! I plug the drive into the newly-upgraded tower and start the process of the data flowing back to its new home, which also ends up being uneventful. I log back in as the user…and Explorer crashes.

&gt;**ME**: Oh, neat. 

I log in with the local admin account and clean out the profile. Logging in as CU again, I’m fine until I complete the data transfer, and then we are back to Explorer crashing. So, at least I have a cause: corrupt data. So now I needed to figure out exactly what it was that was corrupt and causing Explorer to lose its mind. Unfortunately for me, that was more of less “copy data a bit at a time and see if it causes a crash”. Joy.

Eventually, I got to the broken little bastard: a video file about half a GB in size. Everything was fine until I put that bugger onto the system. Once Explorer tried to read it, the whole system went haywire. I transferred everything else over and the machine was running like a champ. I emailed CU to let her know that the computer was ready and set up some time to get it reconnected. 

The appointment comes and I get everything connected and verify that it works to her liking.

&gt;**ME**: So, it turns out the whole problem was this one file that was corrupted. I’m hoping it wasn’t anything crucial that you don’t have a good copy backed up elsewhere. It was “FILENAME.AVI”...do you know what that was?  
&gt;  
&gt;**CU**: That’s ok, I don’t need that anymore. I used it for a presentation once. Actually, I got that from the FBI!  
&gt;  
&gt;**ME**: Wait…what?

CU pulls up her web browser and navigates to a site with informational videos posted by the FBI. If I remember correctly, the video was actually about data privacy or something data related, which made the whole thing even more entertaining.

And that’s the story of how the FBI destroyed my company’s computer.",talesfromtechsupport,1574,1535750657
ArmaSwiss,AT&amp;T took down my client's internet during a busy time for 45 minutes,"So, I work for a Telecom what does Data/Phones/CCTV and we had a Dental office client that had their DVR and cameras upgraded.

Of course the owner wanted remote viewing on their phone of the cameras, but at the time, their AT&amp;T router was acting up and loading incredibly slow, so the Senior Tech onsite at the time recommended her to contact AT&amp;T regarding their malfunctioning router and to have it replaced.

Fast forward a few weeks later, and I'm sent out to replace the power cord for the DVR as they had thrown it out during cleaning.

This was just the beginning of hell. When I opened their IT Closet, I couldn't find a spare power plug near the DVR, and they have a small server setup and a power bar behind it that was crammed to the gills with plugs. Assuming that this server was important, I stopped and asked the client if they had a spare power strip so we could plug in the DVR and give it power. Right away, they began complaining about how they had to do everything, how I should just unplug anything and just get it done, before reaching in themselves and began unplugging things, summarily turning off the server. Eventually we got a power strip plugged in and the DVR Powered on.

Then the real hell began. Right afterwards, the client quips, ""So now you're going to do the remote access for my cameras yea?"", and since my work order stated that Software had to be installed for the DVR, I assumed this meant configure the port forwarding for the DVR. Since this was a Dental Office, it had confidential patient records and as such, I was concerned for HIPAA compliance with having to create a port-forward to view the cameras (And yes, I know a VPN into the network from their phone would be a much more secure avenue, but most clients do not want to pay for a license for the VPN or the time it takes to set it up), but luckily after speaking with their offsite IT, I was informed that the network was structured in a way that the DVR was on the guest/unsecure side of the network, with a SonicWall protecting their office network. Easy peasy right? Wrong.

After getting into their new AT&amp;T router, I configured the port forwarding to the static IP I had assigned to the router, and usually at this point it comes right up, remote viewing is available and job is done. Except it wasn't.

A port-check to see if the port was open was coming up as Connection Timed Out or Connection Refused. I double checked my port forwarding and confirmed I was forwarding the correct port, to the correct address and the device was connected and capable of being access via the intranet.

Really strange. So, after double checking my work, I can only assume that perhaps the issue is on the ISP's side. So we call up AT&amp;T's technical support, and I explain to the Technician what we're trying to do. Configure port forwarding, that the ports have been forwarded but the port is showing closed to the internet.

Cue the absolute hell that falls upon me. The technician can't figure what's going on, and he says the dreaded words. ""Can we try restarting the router?"". It's 12am, middle of the afternoon, busy Dental Office and he wants to shut off their internet, which runs EVERYTHING. Computers, Phones, Payment Processing. Everything. Goddamnit.

I clarify with the Office Manager and the Owner, confirming with the AT&amp;T Technician on the phone that it'll be a downtime of 5 minutes at the max. How fucking wrong I was.

Once the router is restarted, the internet connection doesn't come back up. Five minutes go by, and I'm thinking in my head, ""Oh fuck. What did he do"". Lights are blinking on the router, Technician is asking me what they are doing and tells me something about the connection not syncing. Twenty Minutes go by, the office is at a standstill because nothing can be done, and I can already feel the pressure. I'm the one who's onsite. I'm the one who's gonna be blamed for this. What the fuck did the AT&amp;T Tech do. At this point, I tell the technician, ""Look. Fuck the port forwarding. I need their network back up now."" but he says he's still working on it. Throws me on hold. God fucking damn it.

Thirty minutes in, still nothing is has happened. Internet is STILL down despite the broadband light being a solid green. Why the fuck is there internet access but their office has no internet? What the fuck has AT&amp;T done. Then the technician gets back and says, ""I'll have to transfer you to our 360 Care Center. They will be able to assist you"", but right before that takes place, I'm playing with the DVR and switch it from static to DHCP. Right away, it's assigned their PUBLIC IP address. Lightbulb illuminates, gears whirl away and I realize what is going on.

""What did you do to port 3""

""I put it in IP passthrough sir""

""Why the fuck did you put it in IP Passthrough. Take that off right fucking now"" Almost yelled this.

""I'm doing it right now sir. It's done sir. ""

But still, their internet doesn't come back up. He transfers me to 360 Care, while I grab my laptop and rush over to their IT Closet. Quickly get setup, throw a patch cable directly into the router and check my IP Config to see what address I'm assigned. And I almost shit a brick when I see it come back as a XXXX.XXXX.1.XXX

Their office network was the .1.XXXX. The guest/DVR network was supposed to be a .0.XXXX. I'm realizing what the fuck has happened, the colossal fuckup that has brought this busy Dental Office to a screeching halt for over 45 minutes now. The AT&amp;T technician had factory reset the router.

Now that 2+2 has equaled four, and I realize what the fuck is going on, I'm logging into the AT&amp;T Router as quickly as I can, and resetting all the DHCP Pools to what it was before, and as this is happening, a AT&amp;T 360 Care rep comes on the line and we begin speaking. This technician is state-side, unlike the last technician, and then he says this line that really pissed me off. ""I don't know if the other technician told you, but this is a charge service. Are you authorized to authorize charges on this account?"" And I broke a very special rule. Never curse infront of a client. And I broke that very rule.

""What. No. The technician did not say that. I'm not authorized to authorize charges, and even if I was, I wouldn't be authorizing charges for AT&amp;T to fix what they fucked up. Your technician put this router into IP Passthrough Mode over a fucking port forwarding issue. He factory reset the router and now I'm rebuilding their network and because of his fuckup, they have been out of service for 45 minutes right now""

I shouldn't have taken out my anger on that rep, but luckily he understood and transferred me back to the Technical Support, but instead I got transferred to the phone department. Fuck it, I hung up the phone and finished the router configurations and reset the port forwarding required to their server.

Their network comes back up. Internet connectivity is back, but now it's almost been an hour. Reconfigure port forwrding towards the DVR on it's port, and check on my phone. A connection was made and I can see the cameras. Finally a break after 4 hours onsite. I should have only been here for one.

A quick phone call to the boss keeping him up to date on the situation, filling him in with AT&amp;T's fuckup, and then on to speaking with the client about what happened and setting their phone up to view the cameras. They acts like they're happy, and confirms they can see them, but is rushing out to lunch.

Have to get a signature on the work order, and the Office says to collect payment, but the Office Manager who's there won't issue it, calls the owner, who says they want to have my boss call them, and not to write a check. Great. Bounce between office and boss, keeping them in the loop. Office Manager walks out on break too.......didn't sign the work order. Can't leave without a signature. 20 minutes later, one of the guys in the Office signs off on it and I'm out of there.

Next following day, I hear the tale of what happened between my boss and the Dental Office owner. A screaming match, where the owner was shaking, blaming us for the downtime and how they refuse to pay for any of the work done, OR the power supply that we provided because of their screw up.

A total fucking nightmare from what I heard, and the owner even tried to say my boss was trying to shake them down for payment, and intimidate them because of their gender because my boss is a man and the owner is a woman. A total fucking nightmare. Apparently we aren't getting paid for the time, the job was a total loss of money, and how I screwed up by following the customers request to configure the port forwarding instead of throwing it in the lap of their IT person.

And the day after? Apparently now the remote viewing has stopped working. But at this point, it was working when I left, so her IT person can deal with it.",talesfromtechsupport,2581,1535695771
lincolnjkc,That time I flew to Mongolia to turn the volume down,"I'm an audiovisual consultant and automation (Crestron) programmer. On the side I'm an aviation geek. I love my job for the free travel but sometimes... well.. sometimes I wind up with a weird one. 


Like last week. 


One of our ""clients""* is a super cool non-profit/NGO with a mission to further medical education for fixing/preventing problems with a particular part of the body in developing countries. As part of the program they have an aircraft fitted out with a classroom, operating room, etc., etc., -- totally self-sufficient if they need to be, including water purification, generating their own medical oxygen, etc. [this would be so much easier if I weren't trying to keep things anonymous ;) ] 

Like I said: Cool group, cool mission, and as an aviation geek: I get to work on/around a very cool plane. 

Anyway, one of the complaints/concerns since my last visit--somewhere much less exotic--was that audio on some of the recordings sounded distorted. 

99.9% of the time this is because the volume into the recorder (or somewhere else in the signal chain) is too high and 'clipping'. 

I got a sample of an affected recording and sure enough, I'm even more convinced that's the problem. And I asked them to try turning it down. 

The client's team had some concern about being qualified to turn the volume down themselves. 

So I wound up on a plane, flew from the US to Mongolia (via China), turned the volume down... confirmed the problem was resolved. And flew home. 

Obviously, that wasn't the only thing I accomplished -- one of the big wish list items had been to observe an actual program to see where we can drive improvements and that was the most valuable accomplishment -- but if felt weird starting the trip with the official to-do list being, entirely: 

Turn volume down.

sambeaux45,The time that providing after hours support may have saved my life.,"I will do my best to anonymize this story as best I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

This tale goes back to my time working for a local government. I was a member of that organization's helpdesk. As a helpdesk employee, there was generally no overtime or after hours work. When your eight hours for the day were up,  you were done. There was one exception. The helpdesk provided IT support for city council meetings. These meetings started at either 4pm or 5pm and happened three times per month. A typical meeting might last 2-3 hours, but some meetings went on for 8+ hours. They were always on the same weeknight. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was not that weeknight. My girlfriend had called me and expressed an interest in going to see a movie with a friend of ours. I got off work at 5pm, but our friend worked until 6pm. My girlfriend and I had planned to grab a light supper before the movie. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boss came in at 4pm and informed me that there was a budget meeting starting at 5pm and since it was my turn in the rotation, I would have to cover it. I called my g/f to let her know that I had to work late and I had no idea how late it would be. She decided to go hang out at her favorite coffee shop a few miles away from the theater until I could let her know what was going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

The meeting was relatively uneventful. The video streaming software that recorded the meeting crashed a couple of times, which was not unusual. Otherwise, the meeting went off without a hitch and actually ended around 6:30. I let my g/f and friend know that I was now free and made my way to the theater. City hall was much closer to the theater than either of them and they both needed a little time to get ready, so I was sitting in the parking lot of the theater on a conference call with them as we tried to work out what movie we were going to see. 

&amp;#x200B;

We finally decided on a movie and ended the call after maybe 10-15 minutes. I was tasked with buying tickets for us all so that we wouldn't have any delays getting in to see the movie. I was maybe 20-30 feet from the ticket counter when the doors burst open and people running out. It was surreal to see these people moving QUICKLY, but with very little sound. The only thing I heard people say was ""Get in the car!"".  I stood there for maybe a second or two trying to process what was going on when the person whose car was closest to me got close enough for me to hear him telling the 911 operator that there was an active shooter. 

&amp;#x200B;

I turned and ran back to my car to tell my g/f and friend NOT to come to the theater. Each of those calls probably took 10 seconds or so. By the time I was able to start my car, the first police car had rolled into the parking lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friend later asked why I hadn't gone back in to help. Besides being an IT tech, I'm also a firearms instructor and concealed carry instructor in my state. I asked him how he would differentiate between an active shooter and a good samaritan with a concealed handgun permit. I asked him how the police entering the theater would know whether \*I\* was the active shooter or a good samaritan with a concealed handgun permit.

iKirin,He surely does not understand what we are saying!,"Hi TFTS!

LTL, FTP, Non-Native Speaker you know the drill.
Also sorry if I screw up the formatting, this is my first properly formatted post so please bear with me. (rawr)

This is not a story that happened to me, but a colleague of a very good friend when she was working at $SP in the past.  
$SP was providing a pretty niche application called $software and are one of the largest providers for this type of application in europe. Thus having customers that aren't native to (Common Language) is not unusual. Most customers are pretty nice, but as always there are some rotten eggs in the basket.
Also since this story features text spoken in multiple languages I'll denote the spoken language with () before.

Let's introduce our characters for this little story, shall we?

&gt; $FT: Friendly Tech Person - Tech support that gets sent out by $SP to fix issues customers have or install new software updates
&gt; $GC: Gruntled Customer - Doesn't understand why he even has to pay for software
&gt; $AA: Annoying Assistant - When in doubt, the boss is always right!

The weather was sunny and the road clear. $FT was pretty happy - $SP had recently released an update to $software and so he was sent out to customers far and wide to bring them ~~gifts of joy~~ a new version of $software. This time around he had to go to $GC known for expertly wielding profanities, as $FT recalled from his time when he was working as a mere level 1 helpdesk ~~monkey~~ support. He started his journey at 6AM driving around 4 hours to finally get to the customer.
Arriving on-site and $GC was already waiting with $AA.

&gt; $FT: (Common) [INSERT DEFAULT GREETING]. I'm here to update you to the latest version of $software.
&gt; $GC: (Common) Ah, great that you're here! The PC with $software installed is right over here!

Needless to say $FT was more than a bit surprised - it seemed $GC was one of those customers that bark but don't bite. While he followed $GC to the PC, $GC was having a conversation with $AA.

&gt; $GC: (Troll) That dumbf@#* is finally here. It's already 10AM - doesn't he know some people have to work!
&gt; $AA: (Troll) And as always when $SP updates $software everything goes to sh@# all the time!
&gt; $GC: (Troll) I don't get why we have to pay that much for this piece of cr%@ $software!

$FT continued to the PC and not even an hour later $software was updated, he had checked that the printer worked and it properly backed up to the customers local backup solution. While he was doing so $GC and $AA continued cursing him and $SP. 

&gt; $GC: (Troll) I bet those suckers at $SP told him to take his time with updating $software and doing all kinds of unnecessary sh%# so they can charge even more for this!
&gt; $AA: (Troll) Why did he have to check the printer as well? It *always* works without any issues!

Bear in mind that $GC like many other clients of $SP regularly called in because their stuff is broken. $FT had already helped fix their *always working* printer back in his days at helpdesk.

&gt; $FT: (Common) Anything else I can help you with?
&gt; $GC: (Common) No, thank you very much!
&gt; $FT: (Troll) Good! I'll be taking my leave. Have a *wonderful* day.

It was at this moment $GC and $AA realized they had fucked up - majorly. While $FT did not look like it, he was half troll and even his last name was a typical troll name. As such he also spoke troll natively. With a grin on his face $FT left the premise. The rumors from helpdesk said that $GC had become a rather 'tame' customer after this whole incident.

&amp;#x200B;

me: [foo.example.com](https://foo.example.com) doesn't exist.

dev: OK. When was it removed?

me: we have no record of it ever being in DNS.

dev: OK. But it used to work.

me: Can you give me an example of a server where it worked, so I can see if maybe it was in the /etc/hosts file or something?

dev: It worked from [bar.example.com](https://bar.example.com).

me: bar doesn't exist either; it appears to have been decommissioned six months ago. Do you have a server where it worked recently?

dev: [baz.example.com](https://baz.example.com)

me: baz was decommed at the same time as bar. Are you saying you haven't used this in six months?

dev: Yes. We only run this once in a while. We moved to new servers six months ago but we haven't tested it until now.

me: OK. Well, foo has never been in DNS, and we can't look at the host files from bar and baz because they're gone.

dev: can you restore them from backup?

me: No, those backups are long gone.

dev: OK. We need to connect to foo.

me: Yes, but it doesn't exist in DNS, so you're not going to be able to.

dev: Can you put it in DNS?

me: If you tell me what it pointed to.

dev: Can you point it to where it used to go?

me: No, because it wasn't in DNS. I have no record of where it pointed to. Can you contact the developers of that app and ask them what server you should be pointing to?

dev: that's our app.

&amp;#x200B;

I work as primarily as a developer, but often also as a tech support guy, since I am the newest dev here.

I work for a company that is primary a web store, but we also have wood and brick stores, or what counts for them today inside shopping centers and we have a custom POS for them that is web based. It has connections to web front end, to apps and certain other things so it can do all kinds of things, but the problem as always are  .... users ...

&amp;#x200B;

So onto the story. We have a special feature for the web store where you can enable certain clients to purchase up to user defined amount of products for free every X days. The HQ has been using this for a while, but one of the newer stores just started using this feature. I being the dashing and helpful dev helped them set it up and explained how the feature worked. After confirming that they knew what they were doing I let them be and got back to my regular work, so yesteday I got an email from them going something like this. $me = Me, $manager = manager of the new store.

Hello, $me

&amp;#x200B;

the feature that you set up for us to give some items away for free is not working, when we tried to use it we got a bill and now we do not know what to do. Please do fix it, I thought you said this works already...

So since I was busy with other work yesterday I didn't manage to look at the issue till today. First I tried the feature on localhost, then on dev server and it worked everywhere, I checked version control system and everything was up to date ... Hmmm, what could it be? So I went to check the logs ... Aaaand there it was. They created the bill at 12:15 while they set up the feature at 12:30 ... So I responded back kindly.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello $manager,

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen that you have set up the feature, but the feature needs to be set up before you start using it. Unfortunately since you already created the bill and sent it to your tax ministry you will need to send  cancellation to your tax ministry for this bill and then use the feature.

QuantumDrej,"""I refuse to work with you or do anything you say, but you're a terrible support team.""","Brief context. I'm tech support for a POS software. We serve several clients in different parts of the US, and basic 8-5pm support is included in everybody's contract. You also get 24/7 support if you decide later if you want to be added to that, which means you'll get assistance from whoever's on call for after hours.

One of the businesses we support ($TourGroup) is led by a rather strange, perpetually displeased young woman that we'll call $Cersei.

$TourGroup used to be led by a slightly older lady who, while not the most tech savvy, was always polite and kind when dealing with us to fix her stuff. We never had very many problems with her personally - our only issue with $TourGroup was the fact that NONE of their employees seemed to be able to follow basic instructions or remember basic processes. Most of their calls were helping them with quick annoying stuff, but they were usually very appreciative.

When the other lady stepped down and $Cersei became the head of the business....things changed. Here's a few things to keep in mind:

* $Cersei does not and has never liked working with our support team. We haven't been able to figure out why. She will put in tickets about ""critical"" issues, but then never follow up on them even when responded to. She regularly dips out of scheduled calls to remote in. She reschedules several times and often doesn't show up for the remote session. She will put in tickets, then immediately email our manager before anyone has even seen the ticket yet to complain that we're taking too long to resolve her issue. She gets angry when we suggest any kind of troubleshooting step. Basically, if it involves working with us to any extent, she quickly gets upset and tries to escalate. 
* $Cersei relies on her in-house IT team for EVERYTHING. Remember what I said above about her not wanting to talk to the support team? Yep - if she has to troubleshoot ANYTHING or provide more information other than ""it's broken"", she assigns one of her in-house IT who barely know the software to the ticket and orders us to work together while she goes off to do god knows what. It's frustrating for her IT people because she gives them just about as much info as she gives us. Also, none of them are very familiar with what the software is supposed to do or shouldn't be doing, so the blind is frequently leading the blind.
* $Cersei has also been known to just plop one of her other employees on the phone with us when she decides she doesn't want to speak with us. Said employee often has only a very vague idea of what's going on. Blind leading the blind, once more.
* $Cersei likes escalating. I think she gets high off of it. 

On to the story. This story in particular is what essentially brought my manager to the decision of looking a bit more critically at their contract.

Last year, $TourGroup had been having a lot of issues with being able to perform refunds in the POS software. Which is a valid concern.

$Cersei put in a ticket titled ""Unable to swipe cards"" Explaining that they were having issues swiping credit cards and to please call as it is a huge inconvenience. 

Actually, she never did put in an actual ticket. She **emailed our manager directly** a few days prior and our manager made a ticket for her. She has been told repeatedly that this is not the best way to get support. 

I took the ticket. Asked some follow up questions, mainly questions about how to reproduce the issue, if it was happening for all computers, if there was an error, what kind of swipers they were using, ect. I also reached out by phone, but only got her voicemail. $Cersei, of course, wasn't happy.

&gt;$Cersei: I don't have time for all of this, please just give us a call so we can get this resolved ASAP. This is affecting our business. 

So, I try again to call, but it just went to voicemail. Noted this in the ticket and asked $Cersei if she possibly had a better number where I could reach her. She doesn't reply...for three or four days, even with repeated attempts to contact her. Along with the troubleshooting questions I needed to so much as guess at what might be going on.

Ticket closed for inactivity after four days, per protocol. End of story, right?

Nope. She emails back on the ticket - with her IT people suddenly CC'ed on the email chain.

&gt;$Cersei: When the card is sitting there normally, it shows a green light. When we swipe a card, the light goes out and doesn't show the information in the screen. We replaced it with a new one, but we're still getting the same issue. I think the swipers are black but ordered from you guys.

(Just as a side note, we don't support, manufacture, or sell the swipers. But we DO tell people which swipers to order when they first sign on with us based on what payment processor they're using. The swipers they ordered didn't come from us - they would have been ordered by $TourGroup. In this case, we're trained to send them to the manufacturer first.)

But it finally looks like we're getting somewhere. I cheerfully reply. 

&gt;$Drej: Hi, $Cersei! Thanks for following up. We unfortunately do not support or manufacture credit card swipers - those would have been ordered by $TourGroup and are supported by $Manufacturer. It looks like this is an issue related to the swiper hardware itself rather than $Software. I'd contact them first to troubleshoot. \*gives contact info\*  
&gt;  
&gt;$Cersei: The machines are not swiping. I would like to set up a call with $SoftwareCompany and $TourGroupIT to get this sorted TODAY.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Drej: I am unfortunately not going to be available for a call today, but I'd be happy to schedule a call with you tomorrow at X time. Could you or your IT provide the following information? -insert troubleshooting/necessary info here-

$TourGroupIT replies with the answers to my questions. So far so good. I email $Cersei again to see if she was able to confirm a date for a call the next day.

&gt;$Cersei: This has gone on for too long. Get me the contact information for your supervisor.

Long story short, the ticket is escalated, our manager basically tells $Cersei (gently) why we ask the troubleshooting questions that we do, why we're trying to schedule a call to resolve the issue, ect. Cersei is of course kind and polite to our manager, if whiny as she complains that we ""take too long"" to resolve her issues. Her entire reply to our manager is this screechy rant about she's had nothing but problems with our software and how our support is ""terrible and slow"" and she doesn't feel like her problems are getting handled quickly enough.

The issue was resolved, though - someone had messed up the swiper configuration. Of course, even determining what exactly the issue was required us to spend over two hours on the phone with her IT because again, Queen $Cersei can't be arsed to be on a call to tell us what the software isn't doing that it should, or what it's doing that it shouldn't.

$Cersei also still emails our manager directly for most things. She's also currently on our lowest, trashiest, break-iest version of the software because she refuses to upgrade because ""our upgrades break everything"". 

TL;DR: User thinks our support team is awful and that we're slow, even though she's unwilling to communicate or work with us and gets frustrated easily when encouraged to troubleshoot. ",talesfromtechsupport,1320,1535399554
DarkangelUK,Catching the toner thiefs,"I'm based offshore on an oil platform and printer toner is locked in a cupboard, the reason we don't let regular users replace the toner is that they somehow always manage to fuck it up each time, plus we need to make note of our stock levels as they never tell us when one is used and it takes days for new toner to arrive via boat.

Well of course the nighshift would grab the key to the cupboard when I wasnt there and I'd only realise when I went in to get a toner cartridge and see that we're low. I put a notice up saying 'if you take any toner please inform IT so we can update our stock sheet' but nope that didn't work, toner still going missing, wake up to notes on my desk saying the printers are fucked etc. 

To catch them I created a fake sign out form and stuck it on a clipboard in the stock cupboard with a pen, it asked people to write their name, date/time and what toner was taken, basically they were signing their own confession that they were taking toner and also coincided with the printer logs when the printer fucked up.

zanfar,Please Redirect All Inquiries to Yourself,"Short one from this afternoon:

I work in a somewhat unique situation in that I am on a team that manages the *product*, which being cloud-based, includes some network and system admins. In the same building, there is a Helpdesk team which manages the *office* which sells and supports the product. Making that separation even less clear, some of the more experienced Helpdesk employees have transitioned to the networks team over the years. In short, we have a problem with Helpdesk trying to enlist our help with issues outside our scope, or even dumping them in our laps disguised as ""asking for help"". We are a bit wary at this point any time a Helpdesk employee wanders into our area.

This afternoon, we finally got a replacement printer in our shared suite. This was generally considered a Good Thing as the old printer only would only manage to deliver a single page before going offline, and the next closest printer was three badge readers away.

As they happen to do, the Helpdesk employee (after installing and configuring the printer) took a lap to exchange social pleasantries with others in the office. They ended up wandering into my corner, and after some small talk, graced me with this conversation:

&gt; **$HD**: Hey, who should be the contact for this printer?

&gt; **$Me**: Contact? What do you mean? Probably whoever was the contact for the old printer, don't you think?

*When in doubt, deflect responsibility before you catch it*

&gt; **$HD**: This is a new system, there isn't an old contact. Would you be a good choice?

*Agghh! Get it off! Get if Off!*

&gt; **$Me**: **NO!** I mean, probably not, I'm out on location often. Why do you need a contact for each printer?

&gt; **$HD**: Oh, it's just in case we need to talk to someone about the printer, you know.

&gt; **$Me**: No, I don't. Talk to them about what?

&gt; **$HD**: Like if there are issues, or if we need someone to take a look at it, you know.

&gt; **$Me**: Issues? ... Helpdesk.

&gt; **$HD**: What?

&gt; **$Me**: If there are problems with the printer, you should contact the Helpdesk.

&gt; **$HD**: ...but that's us...

&gt; **$Me**: Yes.

&gt; **$HD**: But who should we contact in this area?

&gt; **$Me**: No one. You should contact yourself and take care of it.

&gt; **$HD**: But what if we need to check out the printer in person? Who can we call to do that?

&gt; **$Me**: Helpdesk. You're a sixty-second walk away from it, *you* can check it out in person.

&gt; **$HD**: ...

&gt; **$Me**: Look, this is a shared, common-use printer. It doesn't belong to any team, group, or individual. On top of that, it's literally your job description to deal with it. I'm sure, in individual cases, you can find someone down here who will be happy to give you a hand if you really need it, but no one in this area needs to have an additional task of managing this printer--especially if it is going to interrupt their normal course of work.

&gt; **$HD**: So I should write down...

&gt; **$Me**: Helpdesk.

So anyway, I work at a college  help-desk. My job mainly consists of helping students and staff navigate the extensive and somewhat convoluted College system, more or less monitor the systems and alert admins when something is going wrong for students or in general (online school program is down, wifi out,etc) as well as maintain the library computers and make sure the 60k piece of crap printers don't jam more than twice a day. 

A big one is emails. My college uses Gsuite, which is basically just fancy Gmail that the college makes students get when they register, and is the only email they'll send college related stuff to.

 I get a call one day from a woman who sounds kinda panicked. 

Me: Hello, how can I help you?

Lady: Hi, are the college emails private?

Me: what do you mean?

Lady: I mean I thought only the school could contact us through them, right? Just the school?

I know the email is basically just a gmail with some extra protections on it from the college, but otherwise works just like a normal email and tell her this. 

Lady: are you sure? Because I haven't put it on any sites or anything and I just got an email from a woman claiming to be the daughter I gave up for adoption 40 years ago?!

Yo, *what*? This floored me. I couldn't actually advise her on what action to take, all I could tell her is if she hadn't posted it anywhere there was a very real possibility that it was her daughter. Emails also aren't listed anywhere outside of online classes where other students can see them, so it genuinely was a, ""holy shit"" moment. I ended up giving her my name and she said she'd, ""come in and update me on what happens"" because she was going to pursue it. I was honestly hoping she would actually come in, though I didn't expect it.

Low and behold two days later she came to the desk and asked for me.

It was her daughter.

Through some question and answer stuff she figured out this lady was legitimately her daughter, and had managed to track her (the mother) down through a lot of extensive file digging and found her college email through this (apparently you can request emails). She was so excited and stunned because she'd hoped forever her kid would reach out but she never did, and she didn't even know where to start looking for her (she thought she'd moved as a kid, turned out she was in the same county of the same state the woman gave her up for adoption in). 

Now she has a daughter, and a 19 year old granddaughter, and both of them are coming up to visit the mother in September.

She told me if I hadn't been able to help her eliminate the possibilities of it being a hack she might never have responded. It's very tech-support lite in a sense, and I don't really think I should be given that much credit, but I'll be damned if that wasn't the best experience I've ever had at my job.

I'm checking each plugin and seeing if its function is still necessary, when I come across one that had been written by my predecessor at the company, called ""CompanyName tag-based sidebar""  I ask my supervisor, $supe, who was also my predecessor's supervisor, what it does.

&gt;$me: Hey, do you know what this plugin does?
&gt;$supe: Oh, that was written for the old version of the site.  It's supposed to show related content in the sidebar. We don't need that anymore.
&gt;$me: Okay, thanks.

I dutifully remove the plugin.  A week or so later, the guy who manages the web store comes to me.

&gt;$storeGuy: Hi, there used to be a custom post type called advertisements, and it's gone now.  Do you know what happened to it?
&gt;$me: Nope, but I'll look into it.

So I check the site's code, and I see almost-identical code for a post type called ""promotions"".  I then assume that the code to create the advertisement post type had been in the same file, and that some clueless person had deleted it, because it looked like it was a duplicate.  I restore the advertisement post type.

Another week passes, and $storeGuy comes back to me.

$storeGuy: So the advertisements are appearing on Page X of the site like they're supposed to, but I just noticed that they're missing from the sidebars of page type Y.  Can you fix that too?
$me: I'll poke around.

I open the site in the Wayback machine, and find a page with the relevant sidebar.  The ads are there, so I inspect them...and they all contain a data redirect through a plugin called ""tag-sidebar""  Oops.

I look at the code for the plugin (thankfully I saved the code before removing it) and discover that that plugin created the advertisement post type, as well as a sidebar widget to display said ads and track clicks and impressions.  So much for $supe's assurances that we didn't need it anymore.

I restore the plugin and re-add the widget to the sidebar, everything is fine and dandy, and $storeGuy thinks I'm a genius.

Bad sign #1: It's a physical disk, not a digital download. This isn't necessarily bad, but it was a sign of things to come. Bad sign #2: The package this disk came in had a label on it, simply saying: ""Win 95."" You can probably figure out what that means. 

After a bit of googling, and even more frustrating trouble shooting, I clicked through some options, to the backwards compatibility section, and told Windows to run it as Windows 95. To my surprise, it launched into what appeared to be a virtual machine set up by the eBay seller.

We are in the midst of phasing out a hop in our network, we used to have a dc in the middle of our route from the headquarters to sister dc. This was done because of the range, and because this hop allowed us access to some well connected datacenters and transits.

In the meantime I get our intern to make the patch from the supplier to our core switch in our datacenter, and I'm ready for liftoff, awaiting $doofus.

A few hours later I still haven't gotten a call, but it's the end of the day, so I figure I'll call the next day.

&gt;$me; Hey $doofus, did you get that patch done for me that I asked about yesterday?  
&gt;  
&gt;$doofus: Nah it was too busy.  
&gt;  
&gt;\* at this point I already know he's talking out of his ass, because he does fuck all every day. \*  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: oh that sucks, but I really need this thing today, so can you please shift some stuff in your 'schedule' and do it ASAP?  
&gt;  
&gt;$doofus: sure I'll see what I can do.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: awesome, thanks.

As it so happens, $doofus came up from his chair, and wrestled the very dangerous Cat6A UTP snake into the cable rails, and into the ports. So a little after lunch I was finally able to get my testing going.

&gt;\&gt; I start by bringing up the ports on both ends, which goes a little as follows:  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Port goes into autonegotiate  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol down  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Half/ duplex 100Mbit/s.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol up  
&gt;  
&gt;\*2 seconds\*  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;Link state down, protocol down.

At this point I've been diagnosing for about an hour, trying to change duplex modes, changing speed modes, autonegotiate, nothing works.

I ring up the supplier and ask them what's what.

&gt;$me: I'm having some issues with a connection, it keeps coming up on half-duplex, and goes down again after a bit.  
&gt;  
&gt;$supplier: Hm let me take a look.  
&gt;  
&gt;\*about an hour of back-and-forth troubleshooting, trying different MTU values, different speeds, duplex modes, nothing works.\*  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: confusing how it goes online only when you set it to half-duplex 100mbit/s, could this be a cabling issue  
&gt;  
&gt;$supplier: Not sure, it does have connection, so it seems cabling is not at fault.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: What type of switch are you running on your end?  
&gt;  
&gt;$supplier: it's a Cisco Catalyst 3560G.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Okay I've got a cisco 7609 on my end, so it shouldn't be a problem, but I'll go look up some datasheets and get back to you if i find a possible solution.  
&gt;  
&gt;$supplier: Alright that's good, talk to you later.

At this point I'm looking up the port features for this C3560G because I've got a suspicion it doesn't have the fancy features my switch has.  
And then it hits me in the face like a flyswatter hitting you at mach 5.

    Auto-MDIX is enabled by default. When you enable auto-MDIX, you must also set the interface speed and duplex to auto so that the feature operates correctly.

The port we have from our supplier is hard-set to 100mbit/s, so its not on auto.

I enter the datacenter floor wielding a pair of side cutters, RJ45 crimpers, and an RJ45 connector and do my magical TIA 568A to TIA 568B cross cable trick.

Back at the office I log into the switch, turn the port back on with the settings correct.

&gt;\&gt; Link state down, protocol down  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol down  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol up  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Full duplex, 100Mbit/s

I do a little victory dance and quickly grab my phone to call up $doofus.

&gt;$nondoofus: Yo $me, what's up?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Hey is $doofus there, I need a favor.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: No he's out of office at the moment, can I leave a note?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Yeah can you ask him to make that cable he patched for me yesterday into a cross-cable?  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: Sure I'll tell him.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Awesome, thanks!

The next day I ring up $doofus, to ask him if he got around to making that cross-cable, but obviously he was too busy doing whatever.

Another day passes before I finally have enough control over the Force to lift $doofus out of his chair to get him to do something for me.

&gt;$me: Hey $doofus did you make that cross-cable for me?  
&gt;  
&gt;$doofus: Yeah I made the cross-cable, its all good and patched in the DC.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: awesome, I'll go and test it later.

And so later that day I start to test it.

&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol down  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Half/ duplex 100Mbit/s.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol up

At this point I'm beating my head against the desk in a vain attempt to mix up the information in my head into a solution, to no avail.

I think to myself, $doofus must know how to make a cross-cable right? But it's doing the exact same thing when we had a straight cable connected...

And so I pick up the phone once more...

&gt;$nondoofus: Hey $me, what's up?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Hey is $doofus around, i need to ask him something.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: he just lef this spot, probably going to the bathroom.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: alright, maybe you know, did he happen to test the cable before he patched it?  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: Yeah he used the cable tester and he said all lights lit up just fine.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: all lights lit up huh? with that 10$ cheap-o-meter you guys use, right?  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus; yeah I think so, oh here comes $doofus, I'll ask him real quick.  
&gt;  
&gt;\*$nondoofus asks $doofus if the cable tester had all lights on during testing.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: yeah he says all lights lit up on the tester.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: okay, can you please drive to the DC for me, with a pre-made, known-good cross cable, and an RJ-45 coupler?  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: Yeah sure, but why?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: please just trust me and do it please.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: ok sure, I'll call you when I'm at the datacenter.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: awesome, thank you.

At this point I have a 99% certainty what the problem is here, and I wish I could bitch-slap $doofus so hard it goes down 3 generations.

Half an hour passes and $nondoofus rings me up

&gt;$nondoofus: Yo $Me, I'm at the datacenter, what do you want me to do?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Okay walk to our core switch, and unplug the port that $doofus patched on.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: done.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: okay now connect the coupler block, and connect the crosscable to the port and the coupler.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: alright that's done.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Ok give a sec to verify.

I log in to the switch and turn on the port.

&gt;\&gt; Link state down, protocol down  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol up

&gt;$me: $nondoofus, you still there?  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: yep, still here.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: okay we're all set here, when you get to the office I want you to go to the storage closet.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: when you get to the storage closet, I want you to pick up the old Cisco 7201 router we have lying around there, and I want you to hit $doofus with it so hard, that he comes gets his senses back.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: \*laughing loudly\*  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: why's that? \*still laughing\*  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Because this idiot made a STRAIGHT cable, when I asked him to make a CROSS cable.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: The reason is, he used that cheap shitty tester you guys have, and it only measures straight cables properly.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: all lights lit up, indicating it was a straight cable..  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: haha, this is going to make for a great story.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: thanks a lot $nondoofus, I'll talk to you later.

Flabberghasted I tell the story to $srtech.

&gt;$me: Finally managed to get that L2 tunnel online.  
&gt;  
&gt;$srtech: Really? finally. what was the problem?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: $doofus.  
&gt;  
&gt;$srtech: \*looks at me confused\* eh, what?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: I asked him to make a cross cable for me, and he made a straight cable, convinced it was cross.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: I asked $nondoofus to put in a good pre-made cross-cable with a coupler, it works now.  
&gt;  
&gt;$srtech: \*laughing at this point\* Good.

And that is how my colleague managed to waste a few days of my time troubleshooting by not knowing how to use the equipment he has to handle.

To this day I'm not sure he really knows how to make a cross-cable, and I don't intend to ask him to make one for me again.

What a shitshow that was....",talesfromtechsupport,863,1534766512
OfficialPiAddict,I can't print all my pages at once,"So, this is a story from a year or so ago. Let me set the scene, I'm a games developer, which means that my family and friends tend to assume that I'm some sort of all knowing computer focussed deity. This leads to many Tech support phonecalls, usually for 5 minute solutions like, ""OfficialPiAddict, I can't figure out how to turn in this windows desktop, the power button doesn't do anything"". To which I tell them to look for a ""big box under the desk"". That usually resolves the problem. 

My grandmother however, usually manages to get herself into more sticky situations. While I have many tales of her Tech issues, the one that stands out the most is the following.

Grandma: Hey OfficialPiAddict, sorry to bother you, but I'm just working on a book at the moment, and I want to print it.

Me: That sounds great grandma, have you tried going to File-&gt;Print?

Grandma: *minute of deliberation* Yes. I've tried that. 

Me: Okay, well did that work for you?

Grandma: No. It only printer a single page.

Me: When you open the print dialogue, can you see a little field that mentions a ""page range""?

Grandma: *minute of working* yes.

Me: Great, what does it say there?

Grandma: it says All.

*At this point I double check with her that the values are correct, and they are. I'm thinking that Word might be bugged, so I ask her to restart her computer. She does, and there's no change. I'm getting a bit confused here, as I run through some other common problems with her. It's now ~20 minutes into the call*

Me: Okay grandma, can you just run me through how you make your book?

Grandma: yes. What I do is, I type down what I want it to say. Then I put in my images, and I arrange them on the page where I want them.

*So far so good*

Grandma: And then when I want a new page, I go to the top, and I press on the file. And then I press new, and it gives me a new page.

..........

This took me a second to process. After some investigation, it turned out that she had created an entire 250 page book, filled with formatting and images, and every single page was it's own document. She had a folder of 250 word documents that she wanted to print.

I explained it all to her, and mentioned that a new page would just appear on its own when you got to the bottom of a document. She then hung up, and went about collating the documents. 

TLDR: Grandma tried to write a book, accidentally saved each and every page as it's own document. ",talesfromtechsupport,1715,1534721256
Calevara,"The financial cost of denial, a tale of networking woes.","I work for a large healthcare equipment manufacturer, as a network engineer. My job is largely helping to integrate our equipment into the hospital network to allow communication. Because our equipment is regulated by the FDA, most of our policies and procedures are outdated and incredibly insecure. As such most of my time is apologizing for our policies and helping to find more secure ways to isolate our equipment, however when a hospital seems to be experiencing a network problem, I often get calls to assist in troubleshooting.

Now for a large chunk of our customers we provide switches to provide an isolated environment for our equipment that we maintain, but for customers that don't want the added cost, or added rack space, we also allow them to connect our equipment to their network directly, provided that a) we validate that the network meets our specs, and b) they assume responsibility for any issue with their network. Of course the problem with this is that like all good network engineers know, it's not the network. It's never the network.


But unfortunately this time it definitely was.

**The start of our tale**

Our story starts Friday morning at 11:30, one of my field engineers contacts me to let me know that he had received reports from a local hospital that their equipment had gone down. This particular hospital had our equipment directly connected to their network, and this issue had occurred previously. The last time I had driven the three hours to the site, spent hours troublshooting our equipment only to receive a call the next morning to check if things were working now and everything to come up.

This time I was far too busy to drop everything and head off to the site, so I asked my coworker to move one of the non working pieces of equipment to the same switch as the controller it was supposed to register to, and see if it connected. If the connection worked, it stood to reason that the issue resided on the only part removed, the hospital network.

Later that evening as I was headed out with the wife to a friend's house, I got a call from my coworker saying that he had done this, but had only been able to get ahold of the hospital on call network admin as the on site contact had left at 4 with things to do. Unfortunately fifteen minutes into talking to the on call person, and trying to explain how the issue clearly resided on their network, we were cut off because she ""had another issue to deal with, and I can clearly ping all of the switches""

**A dangerous situation **

A brief aside here, this equipment is not some low priority value adding equipment. People's lives are attached to the operation of this equipment, and this outage was putting multiple people at risk. We learn early on to take these kinds of issues extremely seriously as a fault of our equipment that we ignore can leave us potentially personally liable. As such my coworker spent every minute he could on Saturday and Sunday trying to get the attention of someone in the IT organization to take this outage seriously.

Finally Sunday night someone finally checked their messages, or the right ear got shouted in, and the issue became priority one. A bridge line was put together and the IT team was engaged, but as this was now a hot issue, no one wanted to take the blame. This was clearly an issue with the vendors equipment and they needed to stop blaming their network. I did my best to show that our equipment was working properly when isolated from the network, and requested packet captures to be able to pinpoint the source of the issue.

I mentioned that this behavior I was seeing felt very much like some bizarre behavior with the connections between the switches (for the more technical, I specifically felt like this was something with the ether channel that connected the edge switches with two ten gig fiber lines back to their cores) this issue was shot down with an insistance that we troubleshoot first one then the next piece of our equipment and run in circles, until I was forced to drop off the call around 10 pm.

**A long and frustrating night**

The next day I was occupied with other work, but about 9pm I get a call from my coworker on site asking to join the call again, as we have escalated this internally to our company, and a second field engineer had been sent on site. Once again I ask for packet captures to test my theory and once again get shot down. I spend **7** hours on the phone doing everything I can, and finally get them to span the ports that I need and send me the packet capture. In it, things look strange indeed. The registration packet of the device is indeed arriving at our controller, only to be ignored. This is beyond nuts to me and I briefly lose confidence that this is actually their network. We start swapping equipment around and bring in new equipment and yet no matter what we see the same effect, but only if the equipment is connected through their network. If it's moved to the same switch it connects immediately, once again pointing back to the hospital network.

Finally at 5 am I drop off the call, needing to be on site at a different project early the next day, but troubleshooting continues through the night. Another field engineer is sent on site to help, and two more escalation people are brought in to troubleshoot. The same troubleshooting steps get repeated over and over again in escalation hell, and each time it points to the hospital network, but the network team has dug in their heals.

**Anger begins to boil over**

The next day I join the call around 10am. We are berated by person after person from hospital IT for insisting this issue resided on their network. They are insisting on alternative equipment be shipped out right away (which we do) and complain that next flight out isn't fast enough. We are called incompetent and are told that we were not treating this issue with the severity it deserved. To the credit of my team we kept our comments civil, and our accusations on mute at least, despite many of us having been working on the issue for most of the past few days, giving up lots of personal time and sleep. I end up being mostly redundant at this point, and since I have nothing much to contribute to the call I end up dropping off around 10 pm to try and get some sleep. 

**A bizarre answer **

The next day I get a request from my boss to join an internal call around 11 am. This issue has escalated to the point that one of our coders has taken a look at the packet capture and noticed something. With the data portion of the packet, the devices MAC address and IP address are included, but the IP address portion of the the data has been changed from 10.x.x.x to 11.x.x.x. This suddenly explains why our system isn't responding to it, the address is completely incorrect now. Of course we don't know what is changing this packet, but we have solid proof now that this is not a fault with our equipment. We jump back on the call and present our findings.

**Sunk cost behavior**

Now of course this is day six of a major outage. Additional staff have been forced to work long shifts on the clinical side to deal with this situation and every executive has been on this call screaming for a solution. Hospital IT has been standing their ground this whole time that this issue is not on their network, so their response is to argue, to obstruct, and try to disprove this new info, going so far as to accuse us of making this up. 

New packet captures are made, different pieces of equipment are removed and added and still the same result. I once again interject that this feels very much like an ether channel issue, and that it had been mentioned to be related to that previously. The lead network engineer of the hospital nearly lost his voice shouting me down that unless I had concrete proof I wasn't to bring up ether channels again.

Finally we were able to convince them to get a capture of each hop. From each side of the connection working our way down the line. Finally we see it. A capture shows that between the core and the switch that has the controller, the data in the packet is changed. Someone else internal asks us to take this down to a single connection to see if this resolves the issue and after one last smoke screen from the hospital IT claiming that the information is changed even in the functioning device, a claim very easily and quickly shot down, they begrudgingly agree to take down one of the legs of the ether channel.

** OH Shit. **

After a brief issue with the ether channel breaking the connection entirely, finally one leg is taken down. Almost immediately, a huge chunk of the down network comes back. Everything starts to work, and those that were still having issues are able to be restored by breaking a leg on the switch ether channel.

 Suddenly hospital IT has become very quiet. I'm listening in on the call on mute, shouting abuse and laughing like a mad man in my car as I am driving. Text messages between my coworkers are flying laughing at the sudden cooperation we are being offered, as IT states they will have to open a ticket with their network vendor to find a root cause. After almost a week of critical outage time, the issue has been resolved by the very thing I had mentioned to them on the first day of the outage. 

Now to be one hundred percent fair, this is a very rediculous thing to happen. As one of my coworkers mentioned, this is like writing a letter, addressing it, and when it gets to its destination, still perfectly sealed, the contents of that letter are different. It shouldn't happen, and it really doesn't make a lot of sense, but after spending days being treated like a liar and a dunce, being right felt really, **really** good. 

**The fallout**

Now during this call a LOT of big wigs at my company had been listening in, and they were very unhappy with the way our team had been treated. All of my team received instructions to make sure to log every possible minute of our time that we had spent working on this issue within the day. See this customer had not paid for a support contract with us Normally for a customer outage like this, we will usually ignore that to try and bring the system up, preferring happy customers, but in a wonderful foresight, the coworker who had gone on site the first day, had made sure to get a PO for this support call. The higher ups had paid for rush shipping, couriers, and nearly twelve resources on site or on remote support to appease this customer only to have the fault be exactly what had been communicated to them on the first day.

A call was put together and a full time-line was worked up. None of it looked good for the customers IT team. In the heat of the outage the hospital big wigs had requested my company management team come for an on site meeting to discuss this issue, likely thinking that they would be able to squeeze out some favors and financial benefits from the fiasco, and now our execs were looking at handing over what will likely be a five or six figure bill.

Meanwhile at the hospital, it was clear that IT was hoping to do damage control, they threw a ""Thank you"" party for their network team for finding the issue, but our team made sure that the full story was given to the clinical team. We got a very awesome thank you from the nurses later that day.

In the end we got a lot of praise from our bosses and we all felt good having actually found the root of this issue, something that may save us a lot of time in other similar situations down the road. For my coworkers, their paychecks are going to look really nice with all the overtime they were able to squeeze in (though unfortunately as a salary man I can't say the same) I definitely hope to hear what the vendor says was actually changing the data as it's a crazy bug, but in the end I think we were all too tired to really appreciate the shear train wreck beauty of this, so I felt I had to bring it to reddit. 

**tl;dr: A customer network team, faced with an outage, blames my company for six days, only to be proven in the most direct way that it is their network. Resume updating is nearly audible.**",talesfromtechsupport,1435,1534656221
CouldIRunTheZoo,My Backup drive is eating my tapes...,"About 25 years ago I was running the tech support for a car part distributor supporting all their outlets. I get a call from Bruno.  He's one of my favorite customers - a completely charming fellow who could rebuild a manaro engine with his eyes shut. 

He calls me ""my backup drive isn't working"". So I book a call and head out and yep - it's definitely cactus so I pull it out and tell him I'll be back shortly with a new one for him. 

A week later I get another call from him. ""My backup drive is eating all my tapes. I'm down to my last one... please help"". Confused, I head back out that afternoon and wander into the shop with yet another drive packed.  I greet him and ask him what's going on. He shows me the last tape as I'm approaching the counter and look around at the screen, and I say ""ok, show me what's going on"" and he hesitantly says ""this is my last tape man"". So he shoves it into the computer and I hear this ""clunk"".... 

I start to grin... and go around the counter and sure enough - the hole from the drive I removed is still there (I had forgotten to book a time to replace the drive). He had been shoving the tapes into the gap and they had been dropping to the bottom of the PC case. 

I open the computer and retrieve the five tapes piled at the bottom and hand them too him. He was ever so relieved that I managed to salvage his tapes.... ""mate, there's no drive there at all.""  ""Oh! I was wondering why it was so easy to insert them, so glad you could get them back for me"". He loved me forever after that.  I replaced the drive properly that day and he rang me that night to excitedly tell me the backup worked. 

Bruno is my all time favorite customer.

sambeaux45,Touchpad weirdness,"I've been trying to think of a more recent tale to tell and life just handed me an opportunity. Rather than going back 18 years, this story is from last week. 

I'm currently working for a municipal police department with roughly 250 officers. The IT staff at the PD consists of 3 people; a programmer, a systems analyst, and a technical specialist. The idea is that the systems analyst handles server side stuff, the technical specialist handles user side stuff, and the programmer supports in house software and/or interfacing existing data with new software. In reality, it doesn't really break down that way. 

An officer drops his laptop off with a note saying that the touchpad on his laptop doesn't work. My coworker ( systems analyst ) plugs the laptop in on our test bench and the touchpad works fine. She tries various things and nothing she can do replicates the problem. She puts a note on the laptop saying that it appeared to be working and left it in the watch office for him. 

The officer drops the laptop off again the next day with a note saying that the touchpad still doesn't work. Again, she is unable to replicate the problem. She brings me in and tells me the symptoms and we decide that it must be something local to the officer's vehicle. We ask the officer to come by during business hours for us to take a look. 

The officer comes by and we both verify that the touchpad is working. He starts plugging things in before I can stop him, and he's got a USB hub with 4 or 5 things plugged in, a power cable, a network cable, his GPS, etc... The touchpad no longer works. I assumed it had something to do with the USB hub and perhaps a faulty usb device, so I had him unplug that. The touchpad still doesn't work. I have him reboot the machine, but the touchpad STILL doesn't work. I have him unplug EVERYTHING, and the touchpad starts working again. After a little trial and error, we figure out that the touchpad stops working when the power is plugged in. 

I go to my office and grab a brand new power supply for him and as soon as we plug it in, the touchpad stops working. I am now dumbfounded. While I'm trying to puzzle out how this could possible be, the officer tells me that if he wiggles the power connector at the back of the laptop, his touchpad works intermittently. Huh, okay... Some sort of EMI from a bad solder joint on the motherboard power connector? So... I open a support ticket with the laptop manufacture. We discuss the symptoms we're seeing, run some diagnostics that all come up clean, and he decides to send out an internal power cord ( replacement DC jack ). 

We swap out the jack, and the problem still exists, but only in the vehicle. I notify the laptop manufacturer and this time they send out a palmrest and motherboard. We get those swapped out, and the problem persists. I tell the officer that I'm going to give him a different inverter for his vehicle and he tells me that he already has a spare. I asked him to try using the spare inverter and report back. After the weekend, I have an email from the officer saying that he's still unable to use his touchpad. I am now completely stumped. We've changed EVERYTHING, right? I start doing research, I ask every tech person I can think of about the problem and we come up with absolutely nothing 

The sergeant of planning and research comes by yesterday and tells me that he fixed the problem. How you ask? By changing out the officer's inverter. He apparently had a faulty inverter in his car. Which inverter did the sergeant swap for the faulty one? The spare that the officer already had.

\*sigh\* 

The officers are generally VERY good at following directions and giving good information about what they're seeing and what they've tried. This is a very unusual case in many ways, but I thought I had lost my tech touch. Sometimes I forget that even the best users lie, but that was only a very small piece of a very weird problem.

Kath: Hi, I'm at *conference hotel* and I can't connect to *my* wifi.

Kath: What key? 

Me: The hotels wifi key, they should have provided you with one to access their wifi. 

Kath: I'm not trying to connect to the hotel wifi, I'm trying to connect to *my* wifi!

Me: *incredibly confused* Your wifi?

Kath: yes. 

Me: How are you even seeing your wifi if you are in a hotel? 

Kath: I've brought by router with me unplugged the room phone and connected it up like it should be and I just want to get on the internet!

Me: *somewhere between speechless and kinda impressed with the logic* umm, I'm sorry that's not going to work, that router will only work with your home phone line, you'll have to get the hotels details and use them. 

Kath: *grumbling* what a con, so I have to pay them to access their wifi? ridiculous. *hangs up phone* 

That was certainly an interesting conversation with the boss when it came to ticket reviews.

OMG_A_Thing,Standing Up for the Little Gal,"Tl;dr has spoilers that I feel would detract from the long version, so it’s at the bottom. 

Hey y’all, long time lurker, first time poster. I know most people in the subreddit are tech savvy, but I’ll still try to provide explanations on anything that might cause confusing to the average end user. 

I’ll provide some backstory real quick. I have a degree in Net/Sys Admin with an emphasis on Cisco Routing and Switching, plus I’m in the last year of my cybersec AAS. Not to mention several certs. I got hired on at an MSP as a Network Engineer a couple months ago. First part of this interaction is shortly after I started. 

M: me, female (one of 5 women in the entire company and only one on the tech side of things)
C: End user who is the CEO of his company and is so computer illiterate it hurts

A lot of our users are cloud based. C royally screwed up his company’s cloud based storage. It was throwing all sorts of errors, you couldn’t access or save documents. [product support] couldn’t even begin to guess what he had done. I’ll save you all the technical stuff. [product support] keeps escalating us to different departments, different tiers, different continents (joking...ish). It’s been about three weeks at this point that we’ve been working with them with no end in sight. 

C calls in. 

M: thank you for call [company], my name is [m].”

C: give me [coworker]

M: he’s out of town, is there something I can help you with?

C, condescendingly: I don’t think you can sweetie. I need tech support. 

M: oh, that’s me! I’m the newest edition to the Help Desk. 

C, same tone: I need one of the men to handle it. I’ve been having issues for weeks with [product] and honestly one more person isn’t going to fix it. 

M: I can give you the most recent update from working with [product support] if you’ll let me pull it up. 

C, again being a punk: sweetheart, I doubt you can help me. Do you even have a tech degree? I’ll call later. 

And he ends the call and sends a particularly demeaning email to my CEO that my CEO forwarded onto our help desk team. 

Fast forward to a few days ago. Our service coordinator has been delegating C’s issued to other engineers (5 of us total) after that, but today I was the only one available, so he transfers him to me.

C calls in again with guess what! [product] issues. 

M, feeling dread: thank you for call [company] blah blah blah

C, sheepishly: hi [m] I goofed, can you help me?

M, remembering all my customer service rapport building tricks from the days were bad CSAT could get me fired even if it was out of my control: gladly, I’m so good at fixing goofs, they even pay me for it. 

C genuinely laughs and I remote into his computer, restore 30 documents he accidentally deleted and removed some adware that had been bothering him for weeks that he couldn’t figure out how to get rid of. 

During the time, I found out he’s a pretty decent guy, has a cabin a few miles from from the tiny mountain town I grew up in and he loves my Uncle’a cooking (owns a restaurant in said town). He’s just a d*ck when he’s stressed. Which not okay to take it out on me, but I get it, I’ve dealt with worse. I worked tech support for [satellite-tv company]. 

After the call, I popped into my CEO’s office to let him know that I’d gotten onto the right foot with him. I then learned that my CEO had responded to him letting him know that he needed to treat his employees with respect or we would be reconsidering our contract with him.


Tl;Dr: end user/CEO of a company we manage the IT for is a punk to me the first time for not being one of the men (I’m female) and not having a degree (I have one and another one I’m finishing after 6 more classes that I start on Monday). then my CEO whips him into shape and we build a decent relationship afterwards.

Yvels,Don't contact me. We will contact you!,"Just freaking happened and I'm still on adrenaline rush. Sorry in advance for formatting and errors, on my phone typing furiously.

For about 6 months already we were discussing a big move of a medium construction business into Microsoft Office 365.

They were under contract with some local business on Citric platform and it was slow and painful for everyone.

We made nice presentation and they loved it. There were some issues with ms project and some questions about licensing they had to take care of before we get a final GO so we had to refer to Suzan as the contact to this move.

I had to order 2 servers: file and backup (part of the project) to be installed. I already submitted to Suzan our work-plan and it was approved. We just needed 50% deposit and credit card no so we could start opening accounts etc..

2 weeks goes by and nothing. I contacted Suzan; they are busy right now. 1 week later: same thing. 1 more week and I call her explaining that the project that was expected to start during construction holidays (2 weeks here in canada) it's in jeopardy because we wont have enough time to get stuff delivered and tested beforehand.

Suzan: ""Don't contact me. We will contact you!"" CliCkc

Ok... not sure what happened but we got busy elsewhere and I didnt think more about it.

Construction holiday is over and I got a call from Suzan's assistant: I must meet some heads about the project.

I went there with nothing more than my cellphone and it was glorious.

I got assaulted from the bat by 3 people about how not professional we have been. Migration should be started long time ago. Why aren't we taking it seriously and whatnot.

Me: Um what do you mean? I never got the Go.
Pres: sure you did. we discussed everything and I told you it's accepted.
Me: you also refered me to Suzan here and I couldn't work with her.
Pres: what do you mean? 
Me: give me a sec. (taking out my phone, opening ACR and pressing PLAY)

ACR: .... ................. .......................... ""Don't contact me. We will contact you!"" CliCkc

You could hear the fly stuck on the window and Suzan's face got all white.

Pres: Could you give us 1 a min?
Me: sure think. want me to wait?
Pres: yes plz.

I closed the door and by walking away I could hear Suzan getting crucified.

I got called back with Suzan nowhere to be seen. Project is officially a GO. My deposit check was never done so promptly by account dept.

I kept stoic face till I got out of office. Still laughing writing this.",talesfromtechsupport,947,1534438588
Thorgar77,I CAN'T HEAR YOU,"Just read [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/97civy/the_frozen_phone/) story and reminded me of a customer I had a few years ago.

At that time I worked in a store for a network company where I mostly did the tech support for customers.

Someday this girl (16-ish) came to the store with her friend.

A few settings where off on her phone and she needed some advise on how to set them, kinda basic stuff for me.

So I start explaining the settings and advised her about some extra apps she could use when her phone starts ringing.

She answered the call and I heard a lot of ""can you repeat it"" and ""I can't hear you"".

After the call I asked why she had issue's hearing people and her friend kicked in by explaining she could barely hear anyone since she had the phone. They already spoken to a few tech-savy friends, family members and even went to the genius bar of the manufacturer. No-one could solve the issue and the ""genius"" told her to arrange a replace but since it wasn't bought in their store she had to go to the store she bought it and ask a new phone based upon warranty.

She received the phone for her birthday a few months ago and still hadn't time to go to that shop with her father (contract was on his name so he had to be present for that).

Since her initial issue was so basic I didn't really looked at the phone but just went through the settings and now it made me look closer at the phone. I already noticed she had a screenprotector but now looking better at it I saw that instead of using a new one she cut of the lower part of the original screenprotector.

And as some of you might already envision.....the screenprotector went over the screen into the back. Covering the earpiece. So I took it off and asked her to call her friend and listen how she sounded. Her eyes grew in disbelief that no-one noticed this before and me and her friend start laughing about the ""genius"" who should've noticed it in the first place.",talesfromtechsupport,729,1534410590
podgerama,"It's Cisco, it just works.","A long time ago my company took on a new client, a sister company to an existing client who after hearing that we got to the bottom of of some networking issues wanted us to come in and do the same.

During our first year with them, we upgraded their mail server and file server. They very much enjoyed not having exchange information stores dismounting on a regular basis. They also enjoyed the install of ExtremeZ-IP so the mac users could access the shares on the windows server with ease and they were especially grateful that we took the time to re-label their patch cabinet which had been put in by rank amateurs as the label on the patch panel had absolutely nothing to do with the port number out on the office floor, which finally enabled us to make sure all the OSX machines were on gigabit ethernet as opposed to the 100mb ports most were on to access their 600MB+ image files. All in all things were running smoothly. the only issue we ever had was that they were a 90 minute drive away from us on a good day when they needed on site skills.

Then they got a new phone system. My company does phone systems, but they didn't go with us or even let us know they were looking. We found out when we got the out of hours call.

$PI = phone idiot

$Me = podgerama

$client = the client

$PI: Hi, i'm doing some work on the phone system at $client, there's something wrong with your network, it doesnt work properly.

$Me: Pardon?

$PI: Yeah the phones aren't getting IP addresses, there is something wrong on your network mate!

$Me: Sorry, who are you and what work are you doing?

$PI: I work for (can't remember company name) and we are replacing their old Avaya phone system with a new Mitel one this weekend, but i've plugged all my kit in place and nothing gets an IP and now none of the computers which go into the back of the new phones get out to the internet. and now, all the computers that were plugged direct in to the walls don't even get an address.

$Me: okay, i was totally unaware of this work going on, and the last time i did some work on their network was on Wednesday and everything was connected and i had access to all VLAN's

$PI: well mate, somethings gone wrong and I cant complete my work until your lot fix this. 

$Me: \*checks monitoring system\* OK, i can see everything was up and working until 10:30 this morning, have you changed anything apart from the phone system?

$PI: no mate, i just started the install around then.

$Me: O.K. can you do a check for me, in the rack there should be a 48 Port HP Procurve switch, what are the lights doing on there.

$PI: That's doing nothing, I've replaced it with a Cisco!

$Me: Pardon? errm, what?

$PI: yes mate, replaced it with a better switch, this one's a Cisco.

(he gave the model number, it wasn't even a catalyst, it was a horrible budget re-branded DLink)

$Me: And there is your fault, what you have done is remove the core switch, with the VLAN's configured on it and replaced it with an unconfigured switch. Do you even know the VLAN ID's that were supposed to be programmed onto that?

$PI: What's a VLAN? anyway, this shouldn't be a problem, its a Cisco Switch, they just work!

$Me: excuse me? could you repeat that?

$PI: its a Cisco, they just work!

$Me: No, the bit before that!

$PI: what?

$Me: the part where you asked what a VLAN was?

$PI: I don't need to know about those, the Cisco switch can do all of that!

$Me: So you are telling me you have replaced the fully configured HP procurve switch, which has ports configured with LACP for extra server bandwidth, and VLAN trunks to separate the phone and data networks with a re-branded DLink and you are wondering why there is no network connectivity.

$PI: I don't normally have to do any switch config because these Cisco's just work.

$Me: listen, mate, you have clearly just walked and started messing with a network that is well above your pay grade. If you don't know or understand what a VLAN is then you don't have the required knowledge to be reconfiguring this network.

$PI: so what do i do, i told them i would only be an hour and its been three.

$Me: you abandon your install, you give me your email address, i send you a photo of the HP switch as it was two weeks ago and my excel spreadsheet of what cable was plugged in where and you plug that all back in as it was before you started at 10:30 this morning. Because of this conversation the call status has changed from out of hours emergency fix to Chargeable out of hours engineering, the bill for this is £250/hour so i don't think you are going to want me to be online for much longer.

$PI: so what do i tell the client?

$Me: i've already started mailing them and i'm attaching this call recording. This was the first my company has heard of the job and your company has not made any contact with us before about this to arrange out of hours support, and from our conversation someone with the requisite skill set was not sent. I would suggest you inform them that the network is more complex than you initially thought and further contact with my company is required to be able to preconfigure your equipment so this job can work.

$PI: err, ok, err, thanks

Anyway. he gets the original stuff patched back in and we hear nothing from them. They sent someone with more of a brain two weeks later who used the network diagram we provided to the client to work things out. I say a bit more of a brain, but not a genius. We got calls from the client the next week after the phone installs, all the Macs in the design department were running slowly and it must be our fault. After a support call to us it turned out the phone boys had patched them into the back of the new phones taking them down to 100mb connections. I proved this by showing the status page of the HP switch now with only 1/4 of its ports active.

The client called the phone people out to re-patch

The phone people patched them directly into wall sockets to the horrible DLink/Cisco and charged the client for doing so.

The macs showed 1Gb connecetions but were still slow over the network, the phone people said it was our problem. much back and forth later with the client getting more pissed off and the phone people blaming our network i decided to pop in.

The answer was staring me in the face with a big orange light. they had configured the port used to link the Cisco/DLink into the HP as 100mb. I showed them by plugging my laptop into the HP - 1000mb, then into the DLINK - 100mb. which turned all of this from free of charge break fix engineering into chargeable work.

The last i heard the client were tearing the phone company a new one for their incompetence, lack of understanding, for the amount of time wasted by the design department and for the £2K of billing from my company to fix their mistakes.

TL;DR - idiot with no networking knowldge and a big bag full of assumptions breaks network after thinking Cisco label will make everything magically work",talesfromtechsupport,2162,1534351273

$CQ : Confused small business boss from Quebec


While doing important work (browsing reddit) I receive a mail from an unknown email, $CQ, related to hiring me as a **cook**, in Quebec. I was about to hit delete when I realized that I was not the intended recipient of this mail.

Not willing to cost a guy a job, I read the mail again and realize that their must be another mySurname myName canadian guy looking for a cooking job. my own email address being mysurname.myname@gmail.com, this can happen.

easy resolution then, I just answered to the mail informing $CQ that he may have sent to an incorrect email adress, maybe because they are similar.

After I arrived home, I received a thank you mail from $CQ and then a few minutes later, the same initial mail, but this time it was sent to mysurnamemyname@gmail.com .

Indeed, with gmail, dot do not actually matter and it is considered the same address.

At this point, I do not know how these two guys communicated before but it is possible that the guy made a typo on his resume, or even did not have a resume and just gave an incorrect email address when meeting for the job interview.

I decided to not let it go, and started to use my google-fu.
No other ""mySurname myName"" on Facebook, but a guy with the right name seemed to have been playing hockey (so original^^) semiprofessional two years prior in specific town near Quebec.

that town , and the name was enough to find the right Facebook profile. it even had a few pblic hockey pics.

So I contacted my homonym through Facebook, informing him of the situation, and suggested him to contact the restaurant boss directly.

Issue fixed ! I hope you got the job, fellow mySurname myName.",talesfromtechsupport,996,1534323985
Dactaxx,The frozen phone,"My great aunt, obviously being old, is not a technology person at all. She got some cheap smartphone to be ""hip"" or something, and of course, she had to call tech support to learn how to set the thing up.

I was at a big family meetup with her and she was telling the story about how she called tech support and that she felt bad because she couldn't get the thing working because it was frozen. Apparently, no matter what the operator told her to do, nothing was happening on the phone. 

She gives it to me to fix since I'm young and understand technology, and I go into another room thinking that this is going to be some severe issue that I will have to focus and spend a lot of time on. Before this point, I had only glanced briefly at the phone, but now as I looked directly at it, I realized something looked really off: the protective fake screen protector thing was still on the phone.

I went back to where my family was all gathered and they asked if I had fixed it. I simply set it on the table and peeled off the screen protector. Everyone had a good laugh about that one.",talesfromtechsupport,920,1534283255

sambeaux45,Beware of sysadmins carrying oxy-acetylene torches...,"I'm sure you've all heard the expression ""Beware of programmers carrying screwdrivers"", right? Well... this is just a tiny bit different. 

As a sysadmin on a ship, I was responsible for many things... The network as a whole, our internet connection, phones, servers, PC's, Ipods... You name it. Further, I was responsible for the various sensors that allowed our systems to work. I was also the resident multibeam sonar expert. So... one day... I'm called down to the survey lab because our two YSI probes are showing different values. YSI probes measure salinity and temperature so that we can get an accurate measurement of the speed of sound through the water at the surface ( critical for accurate multibeam data ). Now, these can be calibrated on the fly, but no matter what we do, one is obviously WAY off. These probes are mounted in a ""sea chest"" in the engine room. A sea chest is just a piece of pipe teed off of the inlet for cooling water or desalination, or whatever. 

So, I grab a fellow sysadmin and head down to the engine room.  Along the way, I pass the Chief Engineer who sees us each grab a set of earmuffs and head into the engine room. Now, he's seen various survey crew head into the engine room to check on various pieces of our equipment, but he's never seen the ""computer guys"" head into the engine room, and I guess this sparks his curiosity.  We emerge a couple of minutes later and head upstairs only to return almost immediately with a couple of wrenches and a ratchet. Again, we disappear into the engine room. About 15 minutes later, we emerge and head upstairs and return within a minute or so with an impact wrench. This time he hears about 15-20 minutes worth of impact wrench noise, before we both emerge yet again, dripping with sweat. I ask him if we can use his oxy-acetylene torch and he hesitantly agrees, but follows us to see what we're up to. I open the valves on the oxygen and acetylene bottles and coil up about 40 feet of hose on my should and grab the torch, a sparker, and a set of goggles. We approach the sea chest and explain that the bolts holding it close are frozen and that we're going to heat them up to break them loose. He eyes us rather skeptically and starts to ask if I really know how to operate a torch. At which point I crack the acetylene valve open on the torch head, hit the sparker, and turn on the oxygen until I get a blue flame. I hit the oxygen handle a couple of times and smile in what I hope is a reassuring manner. He's still watching with some trepidation as we heat up each nut and my fellow sysadmin attacks the corresponding bolt with the impact wrench. Within a few minutes we have all 8 bolts off and we swap out the barnacle encrusted sensor probes with fresh new ones and get the sea chest bolted back together. I put the torch back where it belong and the engineer follows us out muttering something about the world coming to an end when the computer guys can handle a torch. LOL 

We were able to get the new sensors calibrated and were back to work in probably 2 hours. This was not the first or only time that I saw someone completely shocked that a ""computer guy"" had skills outside of computers. ",talesfromtechsupport,2173,1534189345

$Me: ""Sure, let's go take a look at it.""

$Me: *Showing the issue* ""I'll have to order this part. This isn't something I carry in my vehicle stock.""
$HC goes on rant of how nothing ever gets fixed.
$Me: ""How did it get like this? These things don't just sort of implode by themselves...""
$HC: ""Well, it stopped working over the weekend and I called the help desk. They said to check that cable that went into the cash drawer. It was a little loose and they said it needed to be pushed in securely. So I gave it a tap to make sure.""
$Me: ""... What'd you tap it with?""
$HC: ""I found a rubber mallet in the cupboard so I used it to help me. But the help desk told me to make sure it's secure! It's their fault!""

sambeaux45,Do you type that same command the same way every time?,"So... This is yet another tale of offshore sysadminning. In this case, I'm working on a seismic job. We run 20-30 lines per day, 24 hours a day. We are headed to the dock because of weather or needing parts or SOMETHING... My main jobs for this project are processing bathymetry data and making sure that ALL the data gets backed up to tape. I'm done with my part when I see our geophysicist sitting at his computer with a couple of pages stapled together laboriously typing out commands. I go over to chat. 

He tells me that he's several days behind. That he can only process 5 or 6 lines of data in a day and we are collecting 20-30 lines per day. I ask him if I can see his instructions and I realize that he is telnetted into my Unix machine running commands. Running commands typed exactly the same way in exactly the same order for every line. Probably about 10 commands. He does this for EVERY line. 

I ask him if I can borrow his sheet for a few minutes. He agrees, and I wander off to create a simple shell script that runs each of the commands in sequence and takes a line number or wildcard as input. That way, he can simply run ""Process \*"" and process ALL the lines at once. His mind is blown and within a few hours he's completely caught up. 

The next day, he asks if I can make a few changes... make it easier for him to pull up graphs, clean up intermediate files that are not needed, etc. I agree, and make those changes. This progresses/evolves over the next few weeks into a handful of individual scripts... one to process data, one just to view graphs, another to isolate traces, etc. It becomes a very handy toolbox for him, and basically adds nothing to my own responsibilities, so we are both happy. A couple of months go by and I desperately need to get off the boat for some time off. There are no other admins to take my place, so they send a programmer out and I get about 2 hours with him to cover everything he needs to know... He compliments me on giving him ALL the information that he needs, in spite of the rambling, stream of consciousness style of our meeting. While he was there, he took my collection of scripts and wrote a GUI around them. Now, instead of using wildcards, there's a file selection tool, and various command line switches are available through the use of radio buttons, pulldowns, etc. 

Basically, we accidentally created a very user friendly front end to a publicly available command line only data processing system that is very NOT user friendly. Within a couple of months, we were using it as a QA/QC tool as well as a troubleshooting tool for seismic data. We could catch problems in near real time that it typically took at seismic surveyor weeks or months to catch after the data had all been collected and sent off to a processing house. For the record, I'm no programmer.. but back in the day I was a hell-on-wheels shell scripter. LOL",talesfromtechsupport,2197,1533996292

$captain: captain of the ship

$support: Norwegian tech support person


I am awakened by someone pounding on my cabin door. I've been asleep for almost 4 hours. I open the door to see a somewhat panicked crewman. 


$me: What's up?

$crewman: Our helicopter lander system is down, you need to come see immediately!

$me: (blinks) What's a helicopter lander system?

$crewman: No time! Come now!

$me: (starts getting dressed while wondering exactly what I'm in for) Ok, give me a minute. 

$me: ( Heads up to the bridge )

$captain: Our helicopter lander system is not coming up. We have a helicopter on the way, but he doesn't have enough fuel to loiter more than 30 minutes. He's roughly an hour and a half out. If we can't get the system up in less than two hours, he'll have to return to base for fuel. We need to know as soon as possible if you can get the system up. (points me to a screen displaying a ""Insert system disk"" error and a beige box)

Oh boy, this is bad. I open up the box and check connections. When I do so, I see that there are two hard drives. I take both drives out plug them into another machine to see if I can see any data. I discover that the lander system is DOS based. The primary hard drive is toast, it knocks loudly but never fully spins up. The secondary hard drive has a backup copy of the lander system. YAY!! I pull a hard drive from one of our spare PC's, format it, and make it bootable. I don't remember where I managed to find a copy of DOS... I install the new(ish) primary hard drive and copy the backup data from the secondary drive. I now have the lander computer booted and the software running, so I bring it up to the bridge. Roughly 45 minutes have elapsed. I install the lander system and connect the gyro, gps, motion sensor, and weather sensors to it, but it's not showing any data from any of those systems. I tell the captain, and he's very pleased that the computer is up, but worried about the sensor data. The lander system cannot function without that data. He gives me a 10+ year old customer service card with a phone number in Norway. I call and wake someone up...

$me: Hello? 

$technican: Yes, hello? How can I help?

$me: We have a helicopter lander system that crashed. I got the machine up and the software installed, but am not getting any data. 

$technician: You will need to set up all the inputs. This would be easiest if you had the configuration file. It is named xxxxxx.cfg. Do you have it?

$me: I have one, but it appears to be blank...

$technician: Oh, that's not good. Well, we can set up each input manually.

$me: I have a helicopter inbound. I have about 30 minutes to get this system up. 

$technician: That's not enough time to manually configure. What's the name of your ship?

$me: It's the R/V mumblemumble

$technician: Great! We have your configuration file from 10 years ago, assuming nothing changed. Do you have email? 

$me: Yes... but it's very slow.

$technician: The file is only a few kilobytes, what is your email address?

$me: (gives email address)

The technician then walks me through installing and testing the configuration file and we are good to go. I'm able to inform the captain within 15 minutes of the deadline that the lander system was operational. Due to the wind and sea conditions, it took about 15 minutes to get the chopper landed, but it was inside the time window for the helicopter to be able to make it back to its base. 

TL;DR: I was woken from a dead sleep to fix a system I'd never even heard of, with a strict deadline of less than 2 hours... and pulled off a miracle.

Tech_Witch,"Terrible Teenager Touches Tush, Thrashing The Tower","I promised I’d tell the tale of what finally broke the camel’s back and made me quit the job at the sleazy fix-it store. This is only borderline TFTS so if it sways too far from TFTS standards tell me and i'll remove it.


As I have written in previous tales I like to have a spot of femininity when I work in such a male dominated area as IT. The day this happened I was trying out a pretty cool utiliskirt a sewing genius friend of mine made for me, think a kneehigh belted skirt made from tough cargopants material with enough pockets to carry a serious doomsday-prepper’s EDC kit with pockets to spare. I won’t bore you with fashion details so let’s just say it fit in rather well with my goth-y attire I favoured back then (and still do sometimes but thats beside the point). 


Now, in the fix-it shop we had a baby project. It was simply called The Tower and consisted of a full size tower packed to the brim with the highest spec goodies available at the time. This project was the boss’ lovechild and was supposed to be his present for his son (henceforth Sleazeball McGrabbyhands) who sometimes worked hours at the fix-it shop, when he turned 18. Parts had been bought, shipped, installed, rewired and replaced with newer and better goodies serval times plus done up with enough LED lights to rival the most garish American christmas tree, all to the boss’ very specific orders. 


Now, to explain why I call my former boss’ son what I do he was the slimiest person I have ever had the misfortune of working with. Any time he was in the same room to me I could almost feel his stare burning a hole through my bust. Add to that trying to bribe any good-looking woman who came to the store with store credit to get a date, trying to cop a feel whenever he thought he could get away with it and dropping not-so-very subtle hints about what he thought women were meant for (let’s just say it didn’t have anything to do with honest work and leave it at that) and you see what I mean.


It was the day before Sleazeball McGrabbyhands’s birthday and besides dealing with a full day of actual paying work I got the dubious honour of putting the yet again torn down and modified Tower back in shape and bring it to my boss’ office for the him to prep for Sleazeball McGrabbyhands' birthday. Of course on the day The Tower absolutely needs to be finished the store was at it's busiest it had been for months. Extras were called in and Sleazeball McGrabbyhands was one of them. 


As you can imagine I was stressed out, both by legit work piling up and having to avoid/putting up with Sleazeball McGrabbyhands all day. At the end of the day when I was finally done putting The Tower back together again I picked it up, carefully balancing the heavy thing in my arms and carried it slowly from our build area towards the boss’ office. It was at this time Sleazeball McGrabbyhands came up behind me and, in his best “Tokyo subway molester” impression decided to grab a double handfull of my utiliskirt and backside. This startled me and I instinctively pushed myself away from his hands, shifting my balance enough that I lost my grip on The Tower. Down The Tower went and the horrible sound from it hitting the concrete floor made all the other techs turn to see what the frak just happened. What seconds before had been an expensive and time-consuming gaming rig project was now utter thrash. The case had smashed itself open on the concrete floor and pieces of circuitboard had spread out from it like a halo of fail and misery. I almost broke down and cried there and then. Only thing that stopped me from bawling my eyes out was my burning hate towards Sleazeball McGrabbyhands, who had decided to slink away quietly while I was staring at the remains of The Tower in disbelief. 


After sweeping up the circuitboard breadcrumbs I marched straight to my boss and told him what his good-for-nothing son had done and what it caused. Guess who my boss blamed for wrecking his son’s expensive birthday present? That’s right: Me.  
According to my boss it was all my fault. I got called some very hurtful things, told that I should have put more effort into carrying it and that I should just have let his son grab me, no question asked. 


That was it. Namecalling I can take but being told that defending myself from molestation was wrong was so above and beyond morally wrong it could be. I told my boss where he could shove the remains of The Tower and resigned on the spot, effective immediately. Walked out with my head held high and never regretted it.",talesfromtechsupport,1720,1533883505
pinky0926,"""I'm really frustrated with how much admin work I need to do""","These were the words out of the mouth of a client who was on the verge of leaving us. Naturally, the next thing to do was figure out why he was leaving us and what he meant by ""admin work"". 
 
I work for a company that has made and supports a certain CRM using an (extremely) extensive SQL database. It's pretty standard stuff though. A person has a database  record and in that record they have a name, address, contact details and a bunch of other information. The software can run reports (or just a CSV export) on more or less anything if the right SQL/XML is written, so if you want to get back all the people who live in Kansas and don't have an email address but had a criminal conviction in the last 3 years and have that emailed to your compliance department, it's more or less just a couple of lines of select/from/if/where/then statements. The software isn't the most intuitive thing in the world to use, but anyone who buys it can call the helpdesk anytime and make feature requests/report design requests.  We thought it might be useful to get in touch with the clients who never called. This guy (Operations Director) was one of them, and he was inches away from dropping our contract because the software didn't meet his business requirements. 

It turns out he had been given a report by a colleague to run that would give him an CSV list of names of people who needed to be contacted every month. Some 1000 people typically. He would then open up the CSV on one monitor, open the database on another monitor and go through each row (those 1000 or so people) and manually type in each person's email address in a new column. He would literally sit there and flick through records on the database and go through retyping their email addresses into the spreadsheet. Every. Month. 

Turns out his colleagues had all told him that ""that's just how the software works"", and had all been following the same process *for years.*

They would then print the document and open the other screen where they had to look up the data and input new data.  It would take them several minutes for each and they would only get through a handful of these a day per each person.  

He noticed this and showed a person how to highlight the citation number, ctrl-c to copy, go to other screen ctrl-f to find and ctrl-v paste in the value.

peach2play,The tragedy of Y2k,"In the year or so leading up to the millennium, it was all over the news about Y2k. Lots of people were afraid we were going to be thrown back into the dark ages, because most computer programs at that time only coded the date as 2 characters instead of 4, and some other math that I'm sure much more intelligent folks than me can explain. Suffice to say, people were doomsday prepping left and right.  New Year rolls around, and, thanks to the heroics of some amazing folks (I know a few of the coders who worked to keep the dark ages away) nary a peep was heard except...

The date was January 2nd, 2000. I was fresh out of high school and working in the Service Center of a bovine inspired computer company. In walks a man with his tower, sets it down on the counter, and says his CD isn't working.  No problem, we are here to help. 

I grab the serial number off the back, and turn the tower around so the front faces me, when I see it. The front of the plastic case is shattered. Turning the case to look at the ""left"" side (the side that opened) I saw a hole, right about the right size for a bullet holes. I looked up at the customer, back at the computer, then sweetly asked home to wait a min. I ran in back and grabbed the techs, swearing it would be worth it, but not saying anything else. 

We arrive back up front, my three techs look on in wonder, and we all look at the customer who has gone very quiet. He explained he thought the end of the world was near so he stocked up on food water and about 30 Russian SKSs with sundry amo.  His son, who had some mental health issues, had gotten one of his possibly illegally modified SKSs and sprayed the whole living room down.  No casualties, except the walls and the tower.

Took it back, cracked the case. The bullet had missed everything except it nicked the IDE cable. We replaced it on the spot, buttoned it back up, and that ladies and gents, was out only Y2k issue.

shadyITguy,I didn't put that bullet hole there; you did!,"So this happened a few years back. It was technically before I was full on tech support. I was more of a hardware engineer at the time. 

I was working for a company that did third party repair of POS for food chains and a few other random retail locations across the country. This particular retail was based on the west coast, and our facility was in the midwest.

$Shady- Me

$Broken- Client

$Idiot- My manager

$Wraith- My lead/subtle genius

The phone in our workshop rings one day, and it's $idiot. She calls to tell us that she just got of the phone with a client and that they had a POS that had a broken screen and needed repaired ASAP. She assured them that if they overnighted it, we could have it done the next day, and back on a truck within 24 hours. Keep in mind, we have no idea what they are sending us, how bad it is, or anything else. She was infamous for doing this to us, as she had no tech background what so ever. 

Fast forward to the next day, and there is a giant box waiting for us in our workshop. $Wraith and I break it open, ready to get to work on this thing, and we just stand there in utter disbelief.  What we saw, was a POS that was broken in 3 pieces, with a screen that not only had a boot print on it, but what looked a lot like a bullet hole, too. 

We immediately call, $Idiot to the back to look at this thing. She comes back and take s a look and asks us what the problem is. We gently explain to her that it isn't something we can fix, as all the mounts are broken, the screen has a thru and thru hole, and the base looks like it took a good old fashion beating, too. She goes off the rails, as she often did, and started ranting about how we had a contract with the client and if we broke the SLA, that we'd have to pay out a bunch of money, etc, etc. She then told us that we would have to talk to the client when they called back in and explain to them that we couldn't do it.

She locked herself in her office for the rest of the day, and wouldn't talk to us, or the client when they called, so it came to us. We put him on speaker, and talked to him about how it was beyond broken, with boot prints, bullet holes and who knows what else. we also mentioned that it was packed poorly, with no package protection. It was literally just tossed in a box and sent to us. He went on about how we did all that damage, and he wasn't going to eat the cost of it, etc, etc. 

Eventually, we got the Company owner involved, and there were some legal things that happened. Long story short, we didn't pay for it, and $idiot was moved to manager over shipping, while my buddy $wraith became the manager over repair.

So i come to her,i help her set up her laptop,router everything.However wi-fi doesnt work,as it would connect to laptop but wont go farther.I start playing with router settings,unplugging sim and plugging back.After half an hour i ask her:""Did you called them to validate the sim so you could use it?""(Here you have to call the isp to start the connection beetween sim and server when setting up the router)
""Did i have to call them?""
Another story would be:
Same person,calls me 2 days latter that wifi doesnt work.I ask her if she disconected if she is connected bot network doesnt work,if she changed router setting's and the answer was ""no"".I go to her home just to find she unplugged the router from electricity.I couldnt stop laughing while heading home.Poor lady thought router's dont need electricity.

cozmad1,Guy says he lost his file; Forensics majors call him on his BS.,"I've never posted here so IDK if this counts. I'll try to keep it short.

About 4 years ago in College, I was in a fraternity whose chapter I helped start. I won't give the name here, but this wasn't a party fraternity or anything, it was pretty heavily focused on community service and actually forbade drinking at all official meetings and functions. That's not really important to the story, but it gives you an idea about the kind of group we were. Anyways, part of our pledge process involved a presentation that the pledge needed to make and present to the brothers, usually about the history of our organisation. We didn't expect a whole lot, we just expected them to A) get facts right, and B) actually do it.

Well, during my Junior year one kid (we'll call him $PK for Pledge Kid) was being a pain about pretty much anything we asked him to do. To be clear nothing was ""Crazy Pledge Stuff"", we're talking 'do a few hours of community service' and 'have conversations with all the available brothers', and he'd always have some kind of excuse. Eventually, $PK was assigned his presentation, and come the night of, he says he doesn't have it. The discussion went like this:

*$PK:* ""I made my presentation today,, but Power Point  closed before I could save it, and now its gone!""  
*Fraternity President ($FP):* ""Do you think you could present if you had the slides?""  
*$PK:* ""Definitely, I remember most of the talking points.""  
*$FP:* ""Sounds good. $Brother1, $Brother2, and $Me, can you go help him out?""  

You see, what $PK didn't realize was that $B1, $B2, and $Me were all studying Computer Forensics, and had all learned to retrieve a crap ton of information, and a lost Power Point presentation would be easy pickin's compared to some of our assignments. $FP explained this and, looking nervous, agreed that if we could retrieve the presentation that he'd present it. So the lot of us follow $PK to his dorm room, and he lets us take a look at his PC. Well we all ensured that we knew the right steps to recover the document. We go through all the steps, each of us making sure the steps are right (we were students, after all), and we do find an autosaved copy of the presentation.

&gt;*$Me:* ""So is this the presentation? It's the newest file here.""  
&gt;*$PK, looking nervous:* ""Umm, yeah, it probably was that.""  
&gt;*$B1:* ""Great, glad we could find it. Let's open it just to make sure it's right.""  

$B2 opens the restored document

&gt;*$B2:* ""There's only a title page here.""  
&gt;*$PK:* ""It must not be from the right time!""  

$B2 opens the document properties window.

&gt;*$B2:* ""This says it was last modified and last accessed at about 5:30 pm, about half an hour before the meeting started.""  
&gt;*$PK:* ""Well that's not right!""  
&gt;*$Me:* ""That also says the document was only created at about 5pm anyway.""  
&gt;*$B1:* ""If you needed extra time on your presentation we could've given you an extra week. We understand schoolwork comes first.""  

Back at the meeting place, $PK explains to us and to $FP that he was going to make the presentation after all his classes, and that once he got free, he started to create the presentation and closed it once he realized he wouldn't finish in time. We explained that we understood how time can get away from someone, and how we didn't take any of this so extremely seriously that we were gonna kick him out just for a late presentation, but that lying about it was a problem, and how we need brothers to be responsible for their actions and their inaction. How, since our fraternity focuses so heavily on Community Service, we need to make sure that we aren't making flimsy excuses to not participate in service outings. He understood, and I believe a week or two later he did present. But it was agreed by all, including $PK, that this fraternity might not have been a good fit for $PK.

evilninjaduckie,Gaijin attempts Japanese tech support,"Another tale from my time in legaltech.

I had been flown out to Osaka, Japan to assist in setting up transcription for a private arbitration at a hotel. My confusion with eastern-style toilets and astonishment at carrying a hundred thousand *anything* in my wallet aside (""merely"" two 50k yen notes), I adjusted fairly quickly to the setting, settled into the heat and got to work in the hearing room as they were preparing it.

Our system setup was a small linux netbook running our transcript server, connected to a Cisco router already configured for our purposes; we would chain out some network switches from the LAN ports, setting up laptops for local users, and use the local venue's internet access through the WAN port to provide the service to external authorised parties.

As usual I'd set up our core system for the transcription team and started on the networking. I looked around for a floor port but turned up nothing and gestured to the hotel manager, who will be $HM (and I'll list the other actors as they come in a similar manner).

&gt; **$HM**: Yes, sir!

&gt; **$ME**: (unused to such politeness) I, uh, need to get internet access to provide our service.

She goes over to a wall panel and unscrews it to reveal: their own router, plugged into the wall. I ask if it's alright to disconnect and I'm told it's fine, it's just for the wifi and there's plenty of coverage.

So I plug the cable into my router's WAN and wait for it to come up. I can't do much with the server until the internet is instated, so I'm waiting just for this.

It never does anything. I wait, I unplug, I turn it off and on again, nothing. I plug the cable back into the hotel router and connect to its wifi. Internet access is back in seconds. Oh dear. This must be a local router setting.

So I try something else. I take a cable from the hotel's router's LAN port and stick it in our WAN. Nada. Zip. I try it with a laptop.

I get an IP address and have network access, but no internet. And the hotel's internal network has security, probably MAC address limitations. I gesture to $HM again.

&gt; **$ME**: I need direct access to the internet but I think only your routers are allowed to use the local ethernet connections. Can I get a different line or have it reconfigured?

&gt; **$HM**: I am not sure I understand. Let me call an interpreter.

The English interpreter arrives post haste and I reiterate my query to her.

&gt; **$EI**: I am not sure I understand. Let me call an interpreter *with knowledge of technical terms*.

The technical interpreter arrives and I say, once more, my query. He nods at me and calls a number on the room phone. Four men in jumpsuits arrive and he presumably relays my question in Japanese.

After a moment, the men all nod excitedly and smile at me.

I smile back and take a seat.

The men continue to smile and stand there.

After a few minutes of silence, I realise my question has been lost in translation.

There are a few hours before the clients are due to start arriving.

After being told the local tech support does not speak or read English, I attempt to use a flipchart and markers to relay the message using pictograms. This is also unsuccessful.

Running out of both options and time, I wonder if I can reconfigure the router for our service by connecting to it with a laptop by cable and directly accessing the gateway IP.

I am confronted by completely incomprehensible Japanese characters with no way of translating them. I do know what a router login screen looks like however, so I ask the TI for the router admin details.

None of the hotel staff know, so I take a wild stab in the dark and try the default login details on the bottom of the thing (root / root) and ***what do you know***?!

Stumbling through menu options, I do eventually get the router configured as intended, sort out the rest of the room for networking and the job goes off without a hitch.

Now, this woman, in addition to being a crazy person who would later on go on to threaten to blow-up her workplace, which for the record was a school for children with autism, was almost COMPLETELY computer illiterate. I had to spend like an hour explaining she needed an ISP so that she could access her email at home, that this wasn't free, blah blah blah. We eventually got her set up on dial up, because she refused to pay for anything more.

Anyway, when we finally get to setting up the PC, she goes in her closet, and pulls out a monitor and puts it on the floor, along with the keyboard and mouse. I ask her as gently as I can, where's the computer?

Cue a long discussion on how the monitor she had was just a screen, and there's actually a box that it needed up plug into. She was sure she had given me everything, though.

Eventually she goes back into her closet for several minutes, and finally pulls out a tower. Apparently she just didn't know what it was.

I get it setup quickly, we go to Walmart so that we can get a disk for NetZero, and now she's more pissed she has a monthly fee for using it than grateful I got her emails up and running.

JustAnOldITGuy,My PhD gives me much better SQL skills than you...This is mystic SQL,"Over the years I have become the go to person when the iSeries systems operators discover a badly written DB2 SQL that is causing system slowdowns. I get an e-mail forwarded to me that has a chain of e-mails between the user and our operators explaining why they keep killing his SQL. According to the DB2 plan cache the SQL would exceed 20+ hours. Oops. Enter me.

I e-mail the user from this thread and kindly request the SQL statement. After some back and forth during which he explains to me he has a PhD in Materials Science and has taken so much more advanced math and computer programming that he doubts I'll be able to even understand what is trying to do.

As they say Challenge Accepted.

He sends me his query. He is comparing the data in two files to find where the data in the first file is not in a column in the second file. To be more specific he wants to know for a given part if it is never a child in the bill of material (BOM) file. His part file is 100 thousand parts and his part of the BOM file is 1 million parts. Since he is using a not in and the child field is not indexed the database has to look at all 1 million records each time it finds a part that is not a child. Since most parts are parent parts this means a lot of million row full table scans. I think the final result had about 10 thousand parts that were not children.

So a little SQL magic using Common Table Expressions plus reversing the logic so I can use IN instead of NOT IN and I get the query down to 20 seconds. I love DB2 SQL. (for the record I use Oracle and SQL Server as well and if forced to admit MS Access.)

So I send him this new query for him to test. 

Now we have a new back and forth. The query can't be right because it is... TOO FAST!

Finally after much testing on his end he concedes that I am correct and tells me my SQL is mystic. :D",talesfromtechsupport,2477,1533328999

As all of this is happening, I notice his computer is unusually slow for a decent gaming laptop. Takes a few moments for a simple display settings screen to come up. I think to myself that the next quickest step would be to do a reboot.

**Me:**  ""You know what? Go ahead and reboot your computer.""

(*Friend gets unusually annoyed at this request.*)

**Friend:** ""What?! No Dude.. Only bad IT tells people to restart the computer. There is some reason this is not working!""

(*He proceeds to ramble on how at his job, the 'bad' IT people will always tell people to reboot.*)

**Me:** (*Now insulted*) ""Actually, good IT will know when its appropriate to reboot and now is the time"". 

(*He reluctantly agrees to do it but still annoyed about it doing it*.)

**Me:** (*Still insulted*) ""There is a reason 'turning it off, turning it on' is a thing, and its because it fixes a lot of weird issues!""

We notice during the reboot that Windows is doing long updates which is a hint that he is not shutting down enough. According to him, he mostly just keeps his laptop asleep and closed when not using it. I may have a small thread of doubt that there is a 5% chance it still wont work and its like a bad display card or the TV HDMI port is busted but I'm confident the reboot will do the trick.

**Me:** ""When was the last time you shut this thing down?""

**Friend**: ""Maybe once every few weeks."" *(I'm thinking to myself. No wonder his sh\*\* ain't working.*)

After finishing its updates the moment of truth arrives and unsurprisingly, to me at least, the TV immediately gets the display on it right at the log in screen.

**Friend:** (*Looking somewhat defeated.)* ""Ugh! Why does that fix it? It makes no sense!""

(Keep in mind at work I don't get to be this blunt with users and I have to do everything with a grin on my face no matter how stupid it is so now I begin to teach a hard lesson. Also keep in mind that this particular friend loves to boast about his skills at his job nonstop and all the stuff he does so I get a little 'teachy' with him here.)

**Me: (***This may not be exactly verbatim***) ""**Because keeping it on long enough will cause system background stuff to gradually jump ship and stop working. Typically a reboot is the quickest and easiest way to get the operating system back to normal function. You need to shut it down at least once in a while. Also... only egotistical IT will ""try"" and fix an issue like this by wasting everyone's time and screwing with the settings for hours on end instead of trying a reboot."" (*I said all of this with a stern glare and stern voice but it felt good.*)

We proceed to watch the movie with no hard feelings. It felt good to show a little of my 'expertise' considering this particular friend talks not stop about all the stuff he does at work and how good he is at his job and always talking about the programs he creates. I was incredibly insulted when someone who likes to boast about their career and skills insults mine so I pretty much threw the book at him during this whole fiasco.

**TL:DR** \- Friend plugs laptop into TV. No display comes up. Tell him to reboot. He gets mad and tells me only bad IT people recommend that. I get insulted. He reboots, and screen comes up on the TV. He sheepishly listens to me while I teach him a lesson about how IT is more about finding the best and quickest solution for the issue rather than assuming it can be done in some longer time consuming manner.

whornacia,User decides to have her cake and eat it too,"This happened a couple of days ago, I work in a call center for a company that accepts walkins too.

Her version of windows is corrupted. Usually for this we almost always just pull the HD and reformat with a new one. We explain the steps to fix it and she insists she needs it for a conference tomorrow 3 hrs away. Again not a problem we have loaners setup for this specific purpose. We get one out, make sure its ready and hand it to her. Shes grateful for the loaner and then asks how fast we can do the reformat because she needs it tomorrow. 

My coworker and I look at each other a moment before explaining again how we have to fix it and that the loaner should be everything she needs for tomorrow. She chuckles and says ""oh no I need all my reports and powerpoints"" we tell her we cant get the data off it today as it was closing time. She doesnt understand so we tell her to come by tomorrow morning and we can take care of it,  she says she won't have time so she wants to just take the bricked computer with her. We explain why that seems really dumb and pointless but the words just go right over her head so I allow it. She leaves with a blank loaner and her computer with inaccessible data. We shrug and make a note to call her in 2 weeks when the loaner is due back. ",talesfromtechsupport,1693,1532813378
TerrifiedRedneck,Never Trust The Guy That's Leaving,"Another story to go along with my [tale of the broken installation](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8m94wc/its_installed_where/).

The big difference with this tale is that I take an awful lot of the blame for what went wrong. 

My own stupidity and not making time for the simple stuff left us pretty far up the creek without a paddle in sight. But please do remember, before you judge me too much, that as skilled as I am, I was simply used as a firefighter whenever those above me screwed the pooch. I had little knowledge of the infrastructure as that information was kept from me.

Some backstory...

&gt;As the IT Manager (**$ITM**) in my previous story was heading out the door to retire off on the south coast, his handover procedure was, shall we say, a little hamfisted. The main thing affected for the purposes of this story, is backups.  
&gt;  
&gt;Because it's always the bloody backups.  
&gt;  
&gt;For a couple of years, I (**$TR**) had complained that as what was essentially a ""keep the gears running"" team, we needed e-mail alerts for everything. Backups, Hyper-V clusters, anything. I wanted something to tell me if there was an issue so I could get into it quickly and try and rescue it before it affected the couple of thousand people I worked for.  
&gt;  
&gt;Alas, my cries fell on deaf ears and the information hogging $ITM simply read all the alert emails and told us what to fix. It made things a load of fun when he was on leave.

Anyways.

Upon handing his notice in, he started to edit these email settings so they mailed me directly.  I very quickly set up a Distribution List for such things and asked him to send them there.

*MISTAKE 1 - I definitely should have done this myself. Why, will become apparent pretty soon.*

**$ITM** ""It'll mail you anytime it has an error or fails a backup""

**$TR** ""Not for successful backups?""

**$ITM** ""No, there's too many jobs and it'll spam you and you'll just ignore them.""

*MISTAKE 2 - I know, I can hear you all screaming at me. I should have gone and changed that.*

Let's assume now that everything was running smoothly and I wasn't fighting a constant slew of dumpster fires on a daily basis just to keep things running for the 4 weeks between $ITM leaving and where our story starts.

A 6th form student (**$ST**) rushed into the room - on a friday afternoon of all the times she could - and kick starts just a shower of awfulness.

**$ST** Mr TR, I have lost my work!

*I've dealt with this particular student before. He's a decent kid and hasn't been one to BS me in the years I've been there so I forego the usual crap and we jump straight into it.*

I log on to the backup server and start the process of running a restore.

Except, there's no backups for the last five weeks.

None.

Zilch. Zero.

S\*\*\*! 

Right, there has to be an explanation, lets have a look.

**$TR ""**The server's being a pain in the ass. scribble down the file name and I'll recover it for you once I've slapped it about a bit.""

It doesn't take long for me to realise that the problem is that the backups have been failing, daily, for a full month! 

S\*\*\*! S\*\*\*! 

Not just the student data server. Finacial data, database servers that include information we are legally obliged to hold onto for years and ensure we have backups of. We are in a right mess.

I am in a right mess.

S\*\*\*! S\*\*\*! S\*\*\*! 

I could honestly see my job going out the window at this point. 

I dig.

I read through logs of jobs that I should have had mailed to me and discover that the repository has completely run out of space. I dig a little deeper and it appears that it has been doing this for months and $ITM has ""*cured""* it by either manually deleting old backups or extending the datastore it's using as a repository.

Oh crap!

The datastore...

My worst fears come to life when i see that no only has the volume for the Backup Repo filled to capacity. every other volume is throwing alerts for low space and everything is over-provisioned.

S\*\*\*! S\*\*\*! S\*\*\*! S\*\*\*! 

Surely I should have gotten emails about this, too?

Now I'm in a rabbit-hole of errors I need to find and I'm yet to recover this poor kid's work.

At this point, it's time to fess up and go see someone and tell them about the prolem(s) before someone else does.

&gt;*I'd honestly never held my head in true shame until this day. When I walked into the Business Director's office to explain myself.*

Meetings with financial directors and head teachers and department leads soon follow and I have to explain over and over again the issues and stand there and say I have no idea why I didn't know they were happening. The first of my three prepared envelopes doesn't feel like an appropriate excuse for a f\*\*\* up this monumental.

The thing about this story is, there was no magical fix that brought everything back to life. It was a near impossible situation.

I sat with the student and recovered what I could from the locally stored files on the last computer he was logged in to (thank god the profile wipe on logout wasn't working) and instead of losing weeks of work he only lost a couple of hours.

I had a little bit of goodwill left over from $ITM retiring and me keeping things going and I managed to keep my job. But not without being hauled up in front of a committee of governors and having to explain why i wanted to spend tens of thousands on a new backup system with a separate repository. As well as a few grand on increasing RAM on all of our hyper-visors that were running an entire academy's worth of servers on barely enough memory to keep the place functioning.

It was an absolute nightmare few weeks that ended with a checklist being created for whoever was in first everymorning to go through to make surethings were still standing. and to warn us of any incoming issues.

And the problem with the emails?

Wanna take a guess?

$ITM can't spell.

Selben,The Ritual,"**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

**$Selben** - Previous Tier 1 tech support now an IT contractor - a bit more into his career.

 

**$User** - Company employee, calling in for support!

 

**$Soda** - Entrepreneur and IT Consultant and indirectly $Selben’s boss. Extremely knowledgeable IT guru. Previously worked with $Selben at $SmallerCompany. Also had a never-ending supply of 48oz sodas constantly on his desk, in his car, literally everywhere!

 

**$Tech** - The last remaining helpdesk tech.

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

The office was dimly lit with flickering fluorescent lighting on their last legs as $Selben entered the office and sat at his desk one morning. Putting on his headset he looked up to see four ~~mysterious robed figures~~ technicians all stand in unison and walk out the door ~~drawing twisted blades~~ reaching for cigarettes as they left. During the ten minutes his machine took to load, $Soda arrived, waving as he passed by to his own cubicle.

 

Recently all the helpdesk technicians, including all the IT managers, had quit, except for one low level tech who had only been there a month. $Selben and $Soda were brought in on temporary contracts to help until the company got staffing back up to snuff. The other temporary techs were normally internal software devs and were filling in until new people were hired. Unfortunately, this meant they didn’t know much more than $Selben and $Soda about company procedures for the helpdesk. Documentation at this facility was completely lackluster. Almost everything had been tribal knowledge, being passed from technician to technician, making it difficult to troubleshoot internal systems.

 

Immediately on making himself available for phone calls, $Selben’s phone rang and he leapt into action!

 

&gt; $Selben: Thank you for calling $Company, this is $Selben. How can I help you?

 

&gt; $User: This is $User. Badge reader.

 

&gt; $Selben: Okay, let me just get a ticket started.

 

&gt; $User: Great thanks!

 

*Click*

 

&gt; $Selben: Hello?

 

The caller had hung up… $Selben began to fill in the ticket, but before he finished another call came in. He scribbled a note to himself to finish after the call. This user had a complex issue that took right up to his 20-minute call goal but managed to finish it at the last moment. He glanced at his note from the previous call, but his phone rang again before he could touch it. This repeated over the next couple hours, including getting several calls from other users who only stated their name, followed by “Badge reader,” before hanging up.

 

Getting annoyed by the abrupt calls with no information, he put himself on extended call completion so that he would stop getting calls temporarily and walked over to $Soda’s desk. As he approached he noted the other techs had gone on their fourth smoke break of the day, so it was just the two of them.

 

&gt; $Selben: Hey $Soda.

 

$Soda sighed and put himself on extended call completion.

 

&gt; $Soda: What’s up bud?

 

&gt; $Selben: Have you been getting weird calls about…

 

$Soda completed the statement for him.

 

&gt; $Soda: Badge readers?

 

&gt; $Selben: Yes!

 

&gt; $Soda: Indeed, it’s very odd. I was trying to find documentation for it, but there’s nothing. Let’s check with the other guys when they’re back.

 

Feeling satisfied there was at least a plan, $Selben headed back to his seat. Before he made it, a random user from the office caught him ~~with a snare and dragged him kicking and screaming from his cubicle~~ and asked he look at something on their computer. It took nearly 30 minutes. The user had managed to unplug and attempt to plug back in their VGA cable upside down. After some pin unbending due to no extra cables in the supply closet, $Selben got it working again ~~and was able to escape with his life~~ and returned to his desk to find chaos unfolding.

 

Two of the four techs were having a yelling match with a company VP, while the other two and $Soda were frantically taking calls. The call queue had blown up—it seemed none of the badge readers were functioning. $Soda finished his call and somehow got everyone to calm down.

 

&gt; $Soda: Okay $Tech, what did you do in the past when the badge readers stopped working?

 

He quickly got heated again.

 

&gt; $Tech: I don’t know! I was never involved, I just created the tickets that they called.

 

&gt; $Soda: Okay, don't worry, just think. Walk me through a call, would you transfer it or do something else?

 

&gt; $Tech: They would call, give their name, and then hang up. I’d then go and look them up to create a ticket and would ask them to call back if they still needed help. They never would. Eventually I would just close the ticket.

 

&gt; $Soda: Wait wait… Where would you look them up?’

 

&gt; $Tech: I opened the badge reader app, logged in and searched for the user to make sure they were there. They always were. Then I’d create a ticket and close the app.

 

&gt; $Soda: Show me…

 

After only a minute of $Tech showing him what his process was, $Soda stood up beaming and called out to the $VP.

 

&gt; $Soda: Hey $VP, if I can fix this issue permanently, will you buy us all gyros from the corner food truck?

 

&gt; $VP: Of course! No one else has been able to fix it since we got the readers years ago!

 

$Soda opened the badge administrator application and logged in. Quickly selecting all badge readers company wide, he went to their shared settings, and turned off…the sleep timer.



An hour later, all the techs were happily eating their gyros.



Unfortunately, due to the length of time this issue had gone on, most users were still repeating the ritual of calling in, stating their name, “Badge Reader,” and hanging up, before even trying to use it. $Soda suggested making a prompt on the tech support phone line for badge readers that would go straight to voice mail and be automatically deleted after a set amount of time, and $Selben was asked to implement it. $Soda and $Selben received more gyros for this as well.",talesfromtechsupport,1554,1532529277
UnintentionalAss,The Broken Password,"At a service desk at a big, big company sits little ol' me, taking business-to-business calls - and after jotting down some of the cases I've handled, a friend prompted me to post here, thinking I'd do a good job of it... So, here goes - The Story of the Broken Password! 


""Welcome to IT-Service Desk, how can I...""

""One of you did something to my password!""

*Interrupter. I love interrupters as much as I love bed bugs and pishmires...*

""Excuse me, Ms..?""

""Yes, hello! I had my password expire, so I called you guys, and one of your colleagues did something to it, and now it doesn't work!""

*Wrap my head around how she thinks her password is a physical constant that you can ""do things"" to...*

""Well... All right. Can I have your user-ID, please?""

""Is that my login? Because my login doesn't work!""

""Um, well, your user-ID - or username - won't be, um, *damaged*, and I need it to check who you are in our system and to reset your password.""

""That's what he said! 'Reset it', he said to me, and then after he did, my password didn't work!""

*Check her ID and verify her name. Her account has been locked out. Too many tries, most likely. I take her number and tell her I'll call back. I breathe deeply, reset the password to something easy and call her back.*

""Hi, it's UnintentionalAss, from IT, and I'm calling with your new password. Are you by your computer, so that we can make sure it works this time?""

""Yeah, I'm sitting here..."" *She doesn't sound happy. Not one bit.* ""...but I'm at the wrong screen!""

""At... The wrong screen..?""

""Yes. There's two screens on my computer, and it's much better to call IT-Service Desk when you're on the other screen!""

*Mute to take a deeep breath, so that I can wrap my head around how she thinks it will actually make any sort of difference which monitor she's on - and the fact that she refers to them as being 'on' her computer.*

""All right, then - you just have to click and hold your mouse pointer at the top of the CertainWebEnvironment-window and pull it across to the other monitor."" 

""Monitor..."" she mumbles.

""The other screen..."" 

“I know that!”

*I doubt that she knows that. I hear her click and pull and really make an effort to move her window, for some inexplicable reason only she knows.* 

""Shall we try again?""

""Yes, we can try.""

*I give her the password. It's a normal word. An easy word. Yet, she manages to do it wrong some way.*

""No, you see?? It didn't work this time either! One of you did something to my WebEnvironment!""

""Ma'am, I can assure you, one of us did not damage your WebEnvironment in any way, and my password should work. Would you be willing to try again, please?""

""Oh, I'll try again - but there's something wrong, I'm telling you!""

*I spell the password out to her, again, very slowly. Yet, there's still a problem somewhere - and if I could take a wild guess...*

""Ma'am, would you please make sure it says 'DOMAIN' and a backslash before your username?""

""Slash?""

""Backslash.""

""Which one is backslash?""

""Well, it's the slash that goes the other way, backwards, towards the name. It's right next to 'Shift' - the thicker upwards-pointing arrow.""

*She struggles. Oh, how she struggles, but it just won't work.*

""No, there's a backslash, but it doesn't work, because the password is wrong!""

*I start a remote session of WebEnvironment. I put in her username. I put in my normal, super easy password. It works just fine.*

""Ma'am, now I have started a remote session of WebEnvironment, and I used your credentials to login. It works just fine on my end, so I can't imagine why it wouldn't on yours.”

*She huffs, presumably getting an ulcer at the sound of all these unfamiliar words I try to use as diplomatically as possible. I have to try again.*

“Are you sitting at your work computer?""

""Yes, I'm at work!""

""Could you log into your computer with this password?""

""No!""

*I rub my temples, confused beyond reason.*

""Then... How are you logging onto WebEnvironment?""

""But that's what I can't do!""

""No, I mean: how are you on the computer if your System-password doesn't work?""

""I don't know, I just didn't log in! WebEnvironment is the first thing I log into!""

""All right...""

*I think. Man, do I think. I think until my scull hurts. Then, I take a wild guess, and I leap.*

""Ma'am, will you do me a favour, please? Will you check at the very left on your keyboard? There should be a sort of half-big button there, with the words 'Caps Lock' written on it.""

*She goes from angry to furious, because this one, she's heard before.*

""I HAVEN'T PRESSED CAPS LOCK! IT JUST ISN'T WORKING! I CALLED YOU TO HELP ME, NOT TO BE A JERK!""

*Suddenly, she's silent. Oh God, what a beautiful silence. I hear a click. She mumbles something. I hear, to my delight, a co-worker of hers chuckle from the distant Dark Abyss of Ignorance. I wait a few seconds. She types on her keyboard.*

""Ma'am..? Did you press Caps Lock?""

*She grunts. She grunts a beautifully shameful, annoyed grunt.*

""No, I didn't! I hadn't pressed it at all, but it works fine now! It fixed itself! Bye!""

*She abruptly and angrily hangs up. I shed a joyful tear. It's finally over...*

scottishzombie,Routine network maintenance goes wrong,"So this was years ago, back in 2001, and I was working for a company that was riding the wave of capital, just before the [dot.com](https://dot.com) crash.  I was tasked with going and checking all the data jacks under the cubicles and desks in a vacant part of the building that had been occupied, but we were making plans to expand back into.  Tedious work.  All of the cubicles had no chairs, as they had been been cannibalized to other parts of the building.  The only things remaining were the cubicles, the office chair mats, and the occasional piece of office equipment that had somehow been left behind.  So I get work, and start testing the ports.  I walk up to the desk, drop down on all fours, and crawl under there to connect the network scanner.  I'm a big guy, and I can get my work done, but after crawling under 20 or so desks, you start getting tired, and a little unobservant.  So I go walking up to my 24th or 25gh desk of the day, and just like I've already done a hundred times, I drop down an all fours onto the chair mat.

Someone had turned the chair mat over.

You remember that scene in Terminator 2? When Arnie throws the biker in the bar and he lands on the stove?  And he's just struggling to get off it, but all he can do is keep burning himself?  Yeah.  About 3-4 really good puncture wounds in each hand, not to mention the myriad of smaller, bruised pinpoints.  But my knees got it the worst.  Said goodbye to those pants.  I finally did what the biker did and just kind of rolled off to the side of the mat onto the empty floor and laid there, growling and swearing over and over.  It took me a looong time to get up, and finally did so, but figuring out the logistics of getting up from a supine position, without using your hands or knees is quite the challenge, let me tell ya.    

So anyway, that's my story.  A little self-deprecating, but if I got a laugh out of ya, I guess I can say it was worth it.  Now.",talesfromtechsupport,1119,1532431442
ExtraStrengthFukitol,Sometimes printers DO break computers,"An [earlier post](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/910cmc/plug_things_inprinters_dont_break_computers/) reminded me of something I ran into back a few years before I was a paid IT whipping boy.

Back in the mid '90s my dad bought a new PC for home business work.  Since I was already pretty experienced with Wintel hardware, he handed it over to me when it arrived to set everything up.  Things were running smoothly, but they went horribly wrong when I plugged the printer in to install the drivers.  The screen went black, everything stopped responding, and nothing happened when I hit the power button.  I didn't smell any magic smoke but that machine was hopelessly dead.  I didn't think I did anything wrong, though I was still a bit freaked out.  I told my dad about it, and ended up calling the company's tech support.  The guy I talked to was cool about things, but we were stumped.  After some back and forth, they wanted us to pack the machine up and send it back.

After hanging up, I had a sudden thought that I thought I'd investigate.  This computer was still in the AT hardware era where the peripherals (serial and parallel) use ribbon cables bolted to the case's backplane, rather than built into the board.  I removed the screws and confirmed my suspicion.  The internal parallel cable had a non-molded plastic shield that was easy to remove and expose the pins.  There was a defective solder joint that was bridging two of the pins.  So apparently with nothing plugged in, the bridge was harmless but attaching the printer destroyed the motherboard.

The damage was already done, but I was able to fix the connector.  I called support back and explained exactly what I'd found.  I'm not sure the guy was pleased with me tinkering around inside, but I was able to get him to just send a replacement motherboard so I could swap it out.  The operation was a success, the computer had many good years of life, and the printer was no longer homicidal.  I have a suspicion that if I'd sent the PC back, they would have just replaced the board and sent it back, and it would self-destruct again if I'd tried to plug the printer again without identifying the problem.

Lesson learned:  Whenever I encountered peripheral ribbon cables I made a habit of always checking them for defective solder joints.",talesfromtechsupport,736,1532308438
InfaSyn,"Drives fail, permanently bases","Morning all, 

Just had this ticket, still in work so ill summarise the script, unless its worthy of quotations. Apologies for formatting errors, still new to posting.

**Context:** I work in the hosting industry and we have a large customer with lots of big data stuff. He's very quick to blame us for hardware failures, even if mistakes are his or software based. 

**Cast:**  $me - Its ya boi  $ft - fellow technician   $cs - Customer support    $cu - large customer 

$cu - ""this system drives fail again why this system drives fails again and again please fit it permanently bases""

$cs - Hey there, drives were replaced a month ago, should be fine, will escalate to techs

$ft - Hey $cu, please can you confirm the state of the server and which drives have failed?

$cu - ""Disk 12 13 removed from bae"" (its Sunday, its too early for this, help me)

$cu - ""Sorry, old msg, Server is down DRAC shows black screen"" (Drac being Dell's LOM)

$cu - ""please any update""

$ft - Hey $cu, going to physically check your server now, is it ok if we power cycle it?

\*no reply\*

Guess its time for $me to take a look then!

60TB RAID 5 was fine, server was fine. Was stuck at a frozen PXE attempt and PXE was the only bootable UEFI entity. Turns out the customer had wiped his OS previously, was confused as to why his server was apparently down, and thought we had given him failed disks.",talesfromtechsupport,641,1532260601
scienceboyroy,And they probably thought they were doing it right...,"**Some background:** I work in a laboratory that runs blood tests for veterinary patients. There are very few tasks in the lab that I haven't done at some point, but these days I mostly work with computers. I maintain our databases, develop new features for the front-end client, and basically do everything from low-level tech support for my coworkers to writing my own LIS software.

One of my biggest projects lately has been the creation of an online submission form. The most time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone step in our whole operation has always been data entry; there's probably a correlation with the fact that anyone to whom we assign the task seems to hate it, but that's another rant. My point is that over the past year or so, I designed and implemented a system that we hoped would take the place of our old paper form, and by having our clients type their own responses, it would save us at least a couple of hours per day. I had little web experience prior to this project, but I designed it all myself, from the web form to the server backend to the integration with our database front-end client. I have a guy in our IT department who makes the changes to the official website, since I don't have the necessary permissions for that. 

The way the system works is that the user enters the information on their clinic, the patient, the test(s) they want, and any other data they wish to provide in order to get more accurate interpretation from our experts. The form is designed to anticipate the most common mistakes our clients could make, and after dealing with them for 8 years, I've come to anticipate their moves pretty well.  
Once they submit the form (by clicking the ""Submit"" button), a confirmation page appears. It shows a barcode at the top, along with instructions to print it out and put it in the box with their sample (a copy is emailed to them at the address they provided, just in case they close the window without printing it). When we receive the sample in the mail, we scan the barcode and the information is populated in our database. This eliminates the need to have someone spend several minutes typing in the (often just barely legible) handwritten information from the paper form (which, I should add, our clients often seem to misinterpret).

So that's the general idea of it. We've been using it for a few weeks now, and as more of our clients make the transition to the online form, it does save us a lot of time and headaches. But a few days ago, I came upon a submission that caught me off guard, though it probably shouldn't have.

**Here's where it gets interesting:** Someone had gone to our website to print out a copy of our old submission form. This time, however, they found the ""online"" submission form. They apparently reasoned that the ""online"" aspect referred to how they acquired a copy, because they proceeded to *print out a copy* of the web page, *write in their responses with a pen*, and stick that in the box with their sample. So of course they not only defeated the purpose of the online form (since we had to manually enter the data anyway), they actually did it in such a way as to circumvent several of the questions that only appear based on the user's responses.

I had to send an email to the  guy in IT that handles the website; we decided to add some CSS so that when someone tries to print it out, **it will only print a short list of instructions on how the form is to be properly used**. While there's a brief instruction section at the top of the form, our clients (with few exceptions) have never been great about reading those. 

Because as we all know, if users think they know what they're doing, they won't ever read the instructions.

**EDIT: Another odd one from the next day...**

I took a phone call from a tech who was trying to get to our old submission form, but when they clicked on the link, it took them to our new online form. They called to find out how to get to the old one so they could print it out.

I explained to them that we were phasing out the old one and gave a quick run down on how to use the new one.

A day or two later, I opened a package that was clearly sent through our online form (obvious because they had sent it using a FedEx label generated by the feature I had set up on the confirmation page of our form). I opened it up thinking that I would scan the barcode and be done with it, but no...

Inside, I found a copy of our old submission form along with the sample. Not sure what was going on, I used the FedEx tracking number to find the record of the submitted data and the barcode that should have been in the box (because of course I set it up so that all of this was available). 

When I pulled up the data they had submitted, it filled in all of the expected information, but in the patient history section (the part that usually requires the most work for the person doing the transcription, and therefore has the most room for error), it just said, ""See paper form included with sample.""

As far as I could tell, they probably filled out the form, needed a shipping label, and then called us. They went online and filled out the form, but they didn't feel like typing out everything they had just written down. So they made us do it instead. ",talesfromtechsupport,998,1532204395
strra,"I""m rude because you didn't email me back?","I work for an  MSP and one of our clients is a business furniture company in the area. 

Over the past 2 weeks, the owner of that company has emailed three times us stating that the snipping tool isn't working (and that's all the info we have). Every single time she asks for assistance, I've remoted to her computer and am completely unable to recreate the problem. 

All three of the times, I've asked her via email if she can show us the process they're using to get the problem she's seeing and have gotten zero response. Two of the times I tried to call and she was ""in a meeting but I'll leave her a message"". Again, zero response.

This last time, we get an email from our main contact over there asking why it hasn't been fixed yet. My response was exactly:  


*Hi \[contact\],*

*We've logged in to her machine three times at this point and have been unable to reproduce it. We've asked \[owner\] if she could show us the problem happening but haven't gotten any kind of response about it.*

*When can we schedule time with \[owner\] for her to show us the problem in action since we can't seem to get it to do it?*

Again, radio silence. The next day, our operations manager comes into the bullpen and tells us that \[contact\] had emailed him (and followed with a phone call) complaining that my response was very rude and I had a ""not my fault attitude"".

Here's her email:

*Hi \[operations manager\],*

*I need to draw your attention to this email. Assuming best intentions on the part of your team, the ""not our fault"" response is highly inappropriate not to mention unhelpful as we try to solve the issue. We have been long time clients of \[MSP\] and are paying on a monthly basis for IT services. We expect to receive a high level of customer service with a can-do, patient attitude.*

\[owner\] *is the owner of this company and has an incredibly full work schedule. Understanding that it is challenging to not get a response back immediately, if you ever have questions and can't get a hold of \[owner\], either \[owner's son\] or myself should be your default next in line contacts.*

Even the CEO of our company (who tends to be a stickly stickler) read the email chain and failed to find a problem with it.

This is my first time posting a story here, so if I've made any mistakes, please be gentle! For this story, I will be $Argo and the lovely chap that I'll be talking to will be Mr. Not-An-Admin ($MNAA)

For a bit of background, I work on the support desk for an online SaaS system used by organisation HR. As such, this software will often contain sensitive information of staff members stored in its database. Our support desk only offers assistance to people who are confirmed as admins. Cue this ticket coming in:

$MNAA

&gt;Hi support

&gt;My name is Mr. Not-An-Admin and I've recently taken over from Mr. Admin for \[CompanyName\].   
&gt;  
&gt;Please give my account full administrator permissions as I don't have them right now  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks, Mr. Not-An-Admin

The odd thing about this email is it actually came through from Mr. Admin's email account, but they pointed out straight away that they weren't Mr. Admin. Because of this, I knew I'd have to direct him to one of his in-organisation administrators, as having us give admin privileges to any random person who asked for it would be a GDPR nightmare.

$Argo

&gt;Hi $MNAA,  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for getting in contact. Unfortunately, due to our policies on data handling, I am not allowed to change your permissions without explicit permission from one of your active administrators.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have reviewed your system and I can see that you currently have 3 active administrators, including the one who has left the company. Either of the 2 remaining admins should be able to get you sorted out with those permissions.  
&gt;  
&gt;If they are having any trouble setting your permissions, please ask them to get in touch and we will be happy to guide them.

All good, right? Wrong. Not even 10 minutes later.

$MNAA

&gt;Hi $Argo,  
&gt;  
&gt;I think you've misunderstood. I've taken over from Mr. Admin. I need you to give me the admin permissions. Please action ASAP  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Not-An-Admin

Once again, I go back to the client.

$Argo

&gt;Hi $MNAA  
&gt;  
&gt;I did understand the request, $MNAA, however it is not something that I can action. As you are only a regular user, I cannot change your permissions to an administrator. This is part of the data protection policies we have outlined internally. As mention previously, please speak to one of the 2 remaining, active administrators.

I really wish I could say this was the end of it, but it wasn't. Cue this follow-up email (again within 10 minutes)

$MNAA

&gt;$Argo.  
&gt;  
&gt;That is most unhelpful. If you cannot do it, please give me the password to an admin account that can and I will do it myself.

That's right. I'd told him I can't change his permissions because it would be a breach of data protection. Now he's coming back asking for an EVEN BIGGER breach of data protection. Needless to say, I was blown away by this request. To be honest, the passwords are encrypted, hashed and salted to Hell and back, so I couldn't give that out even if I wanted to. 

$Argo

&gt;Hi $MNAA,  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm afraid I can't do that. Providing you with the password for an account that has admin permissions would be a serious breach of our data protection policies.   
&gt;  
&gt;Please speak to one of your administrators personally. I have already established that your account is not an administrator and therefore I cannot offer further support.

I called her to let her know the videos are perfectly fine and that I'll be giving it back to her with a program that can run the videos the way they were when she sent it (VLC installation file) and with copies that will run the video on WMP. She was ecstatic. Right now, I've got all the videos rendering to mp4 in Adobe Media Encoder.

kinkitup4u,A gaming laptop for a client,"A woman calls my shop, says she bought a laptop for her son so he can play his favorite game, and make videos recording himself play like his favorite youtubers. Working together, her and her son managed to get Steam installed but failed to install his favorite game. After several simple questions back and forth she revealed the laptop to be a Macbook Air.


Pause for sigh.


I calmly explain to her that Apple computers aren't gaming computers, and many games simply cannot be installed on them. She asked what her options were, and I told her the most cost effective solution would be to throw together a basic PC with a half-decent GPU, and it would be a great gaming computer for his favorite game. The kid demands to have a laptop instead of a desktop, so together we decided that returning the macbook and getting a similarly priced non-apple laptop will be more than enough for his not-very-demanding game. She thanks me for my assistance.


A week goes by and she shows up at my shop with her son (who I now realize is barely 10 years old) in tow. She places a Macbook Air on my counter, and explains that she tried to take the macbook back and get something for gaming, but her son had an otherworldly tantrum and absolutely demanded to keep the macbook. She spent days reading and tinkering and to her credit, installed bootcamp and had Windows 10 running natively, but now she is out of her element and can't figure out how to install programs in a Windows environment. I accept the job and install Steam and Ultimate Custom Night. (i know, i know..)


Another week goes by and she comes back with a laundry list of complaints. The game, and any other game he tries, run poorly. Screen recording programs don't work properly. He tried installing his other games but there's either not enough storage space, or the graphics card isn't good enough. I explain that the graphics absolutely can't be upgraded, but the storage can (though it's an insane process she wasn't willing to pay for) and she asked what her other options are. Once again, I suggested getting a non-apple laptop. She thought hard but turned the idea down, citing her sons tantrums, and exclaimed that if the kid can't be happy with what he wanted, too bad for him, she's done trying.

Adam3324,"We don't support you, you left the company","Background, I work for 2 sister companies totaling about 400 users together. These companies operate separately to the outside world but are supported by a Corporate umbrella for like our CEO reports to someone at Corp who reports to the President of the entire Corporation on paper. We have an IT dept that is around 20 people supporting those 400 users and we are the first contact for their IT needs, we occasionally have to request Corp IT help with certain items but users still work with us solely.

Just got off a call with an employee who a few months ago left us and moved to a separate company under the Corp umbrella that is not supported by our IT and has sole support from Corp IT. Albeit this employee not a week ago came by looking for a new laptop from us and my boss told them straight up we don't support him anymore and he has to contact Corp IT.

Me=M  User=U

Phone rings.........

M: Adam3324

U: Hi, Adam3324, I have this issue with my desk phone it's been happening for a while and I can't get to voicemails using it I have to use the company chat system, also I can't seem to clear my missed calls or view them, rambles on a few more minutes,,,,, can you stop by when you have time and take a look?

M: I won't be able to stop by, you need to call Corp IT so they can troubleshoot the issue and help you. If they determine the hardware is bad which we do own that desk phone( and let you use it), then they can ask me to replace it but, you will have to call them.

U: Ok, well it just started happening and it's been going on for a while, rambles rambles,

M: You will have to Corp IT they can help you and anything else you need.

U: Ok, so who do I call up there?

M: You call their support desk.

U: So do you have a number for someone up there I can call?

M: I don't have a persons number you need to call the support desk. 

U: Well what is that number?

M: That number is XXX-XXX-XXXX and they can help you with this and anything else you need.

U: Ok, so I will do that for the voicemail problem but, what about my missed calls on the phone it hasn't worked and the screen looks different that before.

M: You will still need to call them, the screen might be different as a firmware update went out to our phones a week or 2 ago changing how some functions look and the backgrounds got reset.

U: Well this problem goes back before a few weeks ago and the background is now white, what are we going to do to fix it?

M: You will need call Corp IT at the number I told you and they can help with that and I will only be able to help if Corp IT determines the hardware is bad and want me to help swap out the physical phone. 

U: Ok well I guess I will do that.

Hangs Up.

TLDR: Employee leaves to a sister company I don't support that has solely Corp (crap) IT support, asks for my help, I provide Corp IT's number, they reiterate part 2 of their issue, I have to again tell them to contact Corp IT and I will not be walking over to fix it.

This morning, my first call was at a car dealership.  I got all finished up and my customer was thanking me and offered me some cucumbers from her garden.   I don't like cucumbers, but she was so sweet and so proud of them, i thanked her and took 3.  It was raining outside, so i put them in my tool bag and immediately forgot about them. 

Fast forward to my next call that was an hours drive away..  After driving an hour, I arrive at call #2.   It's a call to replace a fuser in a big copier, so I gather my tool bag, keys, 2 phones, and huge box containing the new fuser.  I get inside, check out the machine, open the parts box, and get situated on the floor.  I'm now on the floor of a GYNECOLOGISTS OFFICE,  awkwardly wedged in a corner, and i knock over the open  tool bag and 3 HUGE CUCUMBERS roll out of the bag and tumble out of my reach.

ladydovahkyyn,"'Please don't use my name when you tell this story.""","Working for a University, a large portion of our users are people with doctorates who often forget that they aren’t experts in everything. On this fateful day I had interacted with many of these individuals and was admittedly not in the best mood. The players in this story are $ME and $TEACH, an instructor at the University who is several states away from the operating location of myself and my team. 


$TEACH had submitted a ticket the day before regarding her laptop, which could not connect to her home WiFi. She neglected to point out that her laptop could not connect to *any* WiFi, a detail I dragged out of her after my team couldn’t figure out what was wrong. I asked her to give me a call, and late that afternoon, she did just that. 


&gt;$ME: Hello! I understand you’re having trouble getting your laptop to connect to WiFi. I’d like to do some troubleshooting with you, but that would be easiest if I could connect to your computer and take a look. Do you have a desktop computer in your home with a wired internet connection?

&gt;$TEACH: I do! I’m not sure which cable is for the internet, though. 

&gt;$ME: That’s quite alright, could you go to the computer and take a look? 

*I explain what an Ethernet cable looks like to the best of my ability*

&gt;$TEACH: Oh, is it the one that looks kind of like a phone cable?

&gt;$ME: It is! Make sure you press down on the little tab before you remove it. 

&gt;$TEACH: Okay, I’ve plugged the cable into my laptop and it has a little loading symbol.

*A few moments later*

&gt;$TEACH: It says ‘unidentified network’, but I don’t have any internet. 

At this point I proceed to spend about 5 minutes walking the user through troubleshooting this error, most of which involves rapid Googling and reading her the steps because I rarely see this error on what I assume to be a functional network. 

&gt;$ME: Okay, so at this point I’m curious as to whether or not this issue is related to the cable you’re using. Could you connect the Ethernet cable back into the back of your desktop so we can see if it has the same problem?

*short pause*

&gt;$TEACH: (*I can hear the nervous laugh in her voice*) Before I say what I’m about to say, I need you to promise me you won’t tell anyone about this. Actually, I know you’re going to tell people, so maybe just don’t identify me when you do. 

&gt;$ME: Of course, what happened?

&gt;$TEACH: I was supposed to take the cable out of the computer and not the wall, wasn’t I?

&gt;$ME: (*struggling to suppress a laugh*) Yes, the Ethernet cable needs to be connected from your wall into your laptop.

&gt;$TEACH: I’m so embarrassed, I even helped a tech last week to set up a whole computer lab on the campus. Please just don’t tell use my name when you tell this story!

&gt;$ME: It’s an easy mistake to make, I should have mentioned it when we were switching cables around. My lips are sealed.


At this point she got connected to the internet, I remoted in and uninstalled/reinstalled the drivers for her network adapter, and all was well with the world. I’m glad she was a good sport, because I should have been much more capable of suppressing my laughter. She turned out to be pretty technologically capable and perfectly willing to accept help, which I can’t always say of her coworkers. All in all, it was a nice way to end my day.

jft135,Idiot doctor gave his work laptop with PHI on it to his son to use for college.,"I run a small IT business about a couple miles up the road from a big regional hospital.  A couple times a year we recover lost/stolen PC's that belong to them.  This one has the best origin story so far.

A kid brought in his Mac which needed a significant amount of work that he can't afford.  So his generous dad gave him his old work computer to use.  He brought it in to have us wipe it for him and make it like new.  Well, this ""old"" computer is practically brand new and had an asset tag as well as encryption software for the local hospital on it.

Standard procedure is to remove asset tags when retiring equipment, so whenever we see one, we call the company to verify that it has in fact been retired, not just stolen.  I called the hospital help desk, and surprise, surprise this laptop is still active and is assigned to not just any doctor, but a department head.  As is typical when we recover these, someone from the IT dept showed up in our office 10 minutes later to take possession of it.

For those who don't know, losing equipment with protected health information on it is a serious issue.  Lucky for this doctor, it was encrypted, so isn't a reportable loss, but he's going to be in deep shit tomorrow when he gets to work.

N_Leafboy,Flawless logic,"Hello TFTS, long time lurking and I was hoping to share a story someday.    
I got pretty excited when I got into a situation I knew was finally worth sharing, soooo FTP as well!  
Please forgive any formatting errors and be advised English is not my first language.


    Some context:  
I am, among other things, an ""IT coordinator"" in a small call center: meaning I have no formal training in IT but can google better than the next person and have an interest in the field.  
I'm used to fixing the small stuff (My coworkers are for the most part almost computer-illiterate. Not judging, just an empirical observation) and I am in charge of escalating to a local MSP in a clear and descriptive manner when I feel the issue is above my skillset. 


Early one morning, a visibly annoyed phone operator ($PO) came into my office with an issue she could not resolve:

&gt;**$PO**: Hello $Me, I'm sorry to bother you but my computer will not turn back on, there is no light when I press the power button.

&gt;**$me**: Hey, that's no trouble I'm here fot that, I'll come check it out.

I left my almost pristine cup of coffee on my desk with deep regrets and followed her

    Now I already knew this one was going to be weird: either a really simple fix or a pretty bad case of user error resulting in dead hardware.  
That feeling came from the fact she was nervously rubbing her hands together, sign of a sound mind in turmoil over a fuckup.  The word ""guilt"" was practically embossed on her forehead.

    I got to her desk and found the really small form factor (something like 20cm*20*5) desktop they use resting on a small rack under her table.  
I got down on my knees to check it and Immediately noticed something weird: it was upside down.

    I Fiddle with it a bit and notice the power cable was slightly unplugged. *easy peasy*  
I make sure it's back in place, flip the small PC and press the power button. A reassuring green light winks at me.

&gt;**$me**: Well that should do it, it was just not plugged in properly. The weird thing is that it was upside down, did you do that? 

&gt;**$PO**: ... *watching her display intently*

&gt;**$me**: ... *at this point I thought I had broke her in some way*

I was standing behind her desk, so, slightly suprised by her silence and reaction, I got around it to face her monitor.  

&gt;**$me**: Huh?

The Windows loading screen was upside down.   
after 2-3 seconds of total silence with my head tilted sideways for some reason, an epiphany washed over me and I repressed what was the beginning of a very large grin.

&gt;**$me**: *Looking at her* Did you?...

I met her gaze.

Her eyes were begging me not to finish my sentence. They were silently praying to a higher power for forgiveness and, most of all: oblivion.  

I did not have the heart to confront her. The look on her face had confirmed my hunch and my body language was probably screaming ""oh I know"". That was enough.  

&gt;**$me**: I'll be right back, I have to check something.

&gt;**$PO**: *Kinda whispering* Thank you.
 
Turns out before ~~bothering~~ coming to see me, she had just finished cleaning her keyboard with a damp cloth while the computer was on.  
She had therefore managed to make her screen do a 180 by pure luck (or lack thereof).  
Taken aback, a thought so pure it must have hurt formed in her mind: by flipping her PC upside down (and accidentally disconnecting the power cable), it would surely make the screen flip back... right?

Nope, but A for creativity. 

I got back to my desktop, found out there's a combination of keys that allows you to rotate your screen, went to her desk to fix it and went on with my day with a big ol' smile on my face.

First; preface... I'm Zztri, I'm a developer specialized in a few branches of the buzzword ""Smart Cities"". I'm also known as an undertaker - whenever I join a project this means it's dying and my job's to save the project if I can or at least lower the impact of failure.

Lately I became a consultant for an energy company for a GIS - geographical information systems - project. I did what I could for a  couple months but my kidneys acted up - kidney stones so my doctor asked me to take a few days off and enjoy some thermal spa.

Ten days before I started contacting every single person responsible with the project, telling them;

&gt;Because of health problems, I'll be unreachable from *last wednesday night* to *this monday morning*. Please contact me ASAP if anything urgent needs to be done. I won't be reachable at all during this period.

Wednesday night I set up the auto-responder simply reminding people the same thing and set out to the spa. As principle, my business phone was off and noone knows my personal phone #. I do not use social media at all, not even linkedin.

Anyway, I had a good time and I feel much better now. Today at 7am, I decided to check out my mail messages for the first time in four days. About 200+ mails in four days, including the weekend.

Markothy,Can't you just mail it to me?,"I work help desk for a large public university, so oftentimes we get callers that ask about getting their transcripts. After a certain amount of time without logging in, a student or alum account gets deactivated, and after reactivation, it takes until about midnight for account information to sync with the student records server. This information includes things like transcripts. Transcripts are easiest to access through the official student portal, although there are other ways to get it, namely coming into the student records office.

The other day I ($me) had this user ($alum) give us a call:

$alum: ""Hi, I'd like to access my unofficial transcript. I keep trying to log in but it's telling me my login information is wrong.""

$me: ""Hey, great. What's your username?""

$alum: $username

$me: ""As I suspected, looks like your account was deactivated since you haven't logged into your account for awhile. Let me just reactivate it for you, and you'll be able to access your unofficial transcript about 24 hours from now.""

$user: ""Can't you get it to me any sooner?""

Oh boy. I've had people like this before. They've procrastinated something too long and now they won't be able to get their transcript in time for their whatever.

$me: ""Well, the soonest it could possibly be on your account would be at midnight... if you need it sooner, our student records offices close in about 45 minutes and you would be able to go there and they could print out your unofficial transcript for you.""

$user: ""No, I live in $suburb-that's-less-than-5-miles-away, I can't possibly come in. I need it by midnight tonight, can't you just mail it to me?""

$me: ""Um, I'm not sure that we can email you your—""

$me: ""Uhhhh... I don't think the mail would get it to you in time. I'm going to transfer you to student records once I get you into your account.""

It's not my problem that you put this off for too long. It's your problem. There's even a very simple solution. If you don't have a car we even have this thing called public transit and it definitely goes to your suburb.

Which is annoying on multiple levels. First, I miss $Tunes... we have wonderful, intellectual conversations on a variety of subjects. Second, it is kind of creepy being the only person on the floor for the last three nights. 


It is finally slow at the moment. Time to get some writing in.


**Holiday Coverage**


You know we had a holiday this week? I couldn't really tell looking at the maintenance calendar. Freaking hard moratorium and I was double booked... seriously? It was supposed to be ZERO. I was looking forward to writing.


To make matters worse, my entire department was supposed to receive a holiday lunch. One of the perks for working a holiday. Except... the person in charge (fairly new) completely forgot our department existed. Ok... shoot... 


Except... I didn't bring a lunch... and I couldn't buy a lunch... because everything was closed due to... you know... A HOLIDAY. 


Basically, I was screwed. 


To make matters worse, one of the maintenances went REALLY bad. Not my fault, I swear!


I was granted permission to buy something... but would have to go downtown to do so. I would be away from my desk for about an hour... in the middle of working maintenances. Was not an option if I gave a damn about customers.


Missing one meal wasn't going to kill me. However, management WAS made aware of the screw-up. 


**Access Denied!**


We had some transport gear fail in the field. The maintenance was an emergency card replacement. Fairly routine. Shouldn't have been an issue. Except... the alarms didn't look right to me. Transport is handled by a different group. I have zero visiblity to the gear or their alarming systems, but I can read their ticket worklogs.


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


That isn't a card failure alarm. That is something else. It just felt wrong to me. I told $Optical what I felt.


&gt; **$Optical:** $Vendor said it is a failed card.


Some how transport was still working, but it was definitely sketchy. I agreed that it needed to be fixed. A critical alarm was not something to be scoffed at.


$Tech gets on site, and has problems accessing the building. He had a key card, but it wasn't working. One hour, fifteen minutes later, that finally gets straightened out. He now has access to the building. I should note, $Tech was an employee of the very same company that owned the building. A bit odd, but apparently there was a recent change made and not all techs were set up correctly. I'll just go with it.


He arrives at our cage. These at one time had card readers as well. Except, they were recently torn out and replaced with padlocks. $Tech was not informed of this recent change.


Who has the combination? There wasn't any record of locks being on site. Another hour wasted to track this down.


Finally, $Tech is able to view our equipment. And... $Vendor had him verify the critical alarms were active. THEN... they decided to have the card delivered. This was pre-ordered twelve hours ago. The courier was close by, but couldn't find a parking spot. He ended up just pulling in front of the building so $Tech can just grab it.


&gt; **$Patches:** Now, don't drop it.  


I don't think $Tech appreciated my joke. This card... would probably pay off my house. We aren't talking cheap gear here.


**Definition of Insanity**


Time to do my part. Most traffic we re-routed to other paths, and what remained were secondary. This should be quick and easy.


Per $Vendor's instructions, $Tech powers down the gear, inserts the card, and powers it back up. Except... nothing is working. We only had a singal alarm come in through the management port.


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


Another power cycle.  


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


Not good. Ok, due to the late start we were approaching the end of the maintenance window. Those secondary paths could not be kept down all night. $VIP-Group gets VERY cranky when they even have to go down for maintenance. They consider it an outage if they pass a certain threshold.


&gt; **$Patches:** We need to attempt a back out. We don't have time for additional testing.  


Due to the critical nature of $VIP-Group's data paths, no one except $Vendor argued with me. The original card (which was working before they toucehd it) was put back in and powered up.


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


The shelf was effectively hard down. It did not recover after the power cycle and $Vendor insisted the issue was the card.


&gt; **$Patches:** $Vendor, I want to clearly state... I find it statistically improbible that a brand new card would have the exact same error as the failed one.  
&gt; **$Vendor:** Oh, it happens. Occassionally you get a card that is DOA. We try to test the refurbished ones before they go out, but sometimes these things happen.  


Now THAT was an interesting slip. He said it was refurbished. According to our contract, it was supposed to be new. Notes made for management's sake.  


&gt; **$Patches:** Have you looked at the back plane or shelf? The alarm in question is indicating something else is there.  
&gt; **$Vendor:** Why? What are you seeing?  
&gt; **$Patches:** I don't have visibility to any of this equipment. That would be $Optical. I am just familiar with how things work.  
&gt; **$Vendor:** Perhaps you should leave this to the people with experience.  


I wasn't going to fight it. After all, this wasn't my gear. I just felt they were looking at this wrong.  


Two hours later (poor $Tech, I suggested he take a nap, but he was afraid to)... another card arrives.  At this point, the maintenance has turned into an outage. 


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


&gt; **$Patches:** Ok... come on, there has to be something else wrong.  
&gt; **$Vendor:** It's rare, but two DOA cards can happen.  


Two hours later (once again, poor $Tech... he was struggling)... another card arrives. The outage got upgraded to higher visibilty.  


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


&gt; **$Patches:** Really? Come on... There has to be something else.  
&gt; **$Vendor:** I'm ordering a new card now.  


The irritation in my voice was definitely coming through. Some of my local support team expressed concern via IMs. Remember that holiday meal I didn't get? Yah... I was getting cranky, and it was starting to show.  


I handed off to the next shift (was really hoping to see it completed), and headed home. I was already way past end of shift (and my shift is 10 hours long). 


After grabbing food ($Wifie's Korean BBQ experiment), and sleep, it was time to go back to work. The very first thing I did was follow up on the disaster of a maintenance.


Another card... and one more after that... A total of SIX cards were tested.  


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


Not a single one worked. Then, $Optical (not sure exactly who on that team, since I wasn't physically present) noticed that about five minutes before the alarm, the equipment experienced a power hit. There were storms in the area, so this wasn't completely unexpected, except... no one looked at history. (Something that I do on every ticket.)  


This equipment had an interesting glitch that occurred during power surges, such as when power is suddenly turned back on after a power outage. It drops its configs on the shelf.


And... wouldn't you know it? The default configs are looking for a card that hasn't been used in over five years. Which would give you an error similar to...  


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


Configs were restored from backup. Service came up immediately. Case closed.


**Take Two!**


The night after the holiday was once again filled with maintenances even though it was a hard moratorium. Go fig. Another one... was IDENTICAL... to the issue from the night before.  


*Circuit Pack Mismatch*


&gt; **$Patches:** $Vendor, by chance are you the same individual who worked on a similar issue yesterday?  
&gt; **$Vendor:** Yes, that would be me. I am the on-call all this week.  
&gt; **$Patches:** Second question before I go back on mute. Will you be checking the shelf configs before ordering new cards tonight?  
&gt; **$Vendor:** I just realized who you are... yes... and... Huh... Did this site lose power?  


I was giggling at my desk. 


&gt; **$Optical:** Actually, the building was struck by lightning. Why do you ask?  


I completely broke down laughing.  


&gt; **$Vendor:** The configs are missing on the shelf.  


At this point, I had to excuse myself from the area and grab some coffee. Between lack of sleep and being slaphappy, I wasn't going to be much use on that call.


We had it fixed within the hour.


**Just When You Think It's Over...**


It's close to end of shift... almost there... and... FIBER CUT! God, damn it! 


The next shift wasn't in just yet. Let's ignore the part where there is supposed to be people scheduled one hour before I even leave. So, focusing  on customers, I worked the issue. Coordinated various groups, dispatch sent techs en route, breaks being identified, the usual.


Management, who were notified as part of the outage process, started asking very good questions.


&gt; **$Manager:** $Patches, why don't you hand this off to day shift?  
&gt; **$Patches:** They aren't in yet.  
&gt; **$Manager:** Wait, what? It's past eight.  
&gt; **$Patches:** I am very aware of that, sir.  


I am not sure who was more pissed. Myself or my manager. This was Friday. The office should have been filled. And no one was in to release me.  


I ended up getting out of here at a quarter to ten. I was not happy about it. Management was not happy about it. 


I still haven't received an explanation on what the heck happened there. It wouldn't be the first time a manager accidently gave an entire shift the day off. 


**Epilogue**


My buds from around the states checked with me the next night. They wanted to make sure I was feeling ok, because I just had two nasty nights in a row. I really appreciate that. I told them so. I also explained that I try to start each day off with a clean slate.


Still... not much sleep this week.",talesfromtechsupport,1188,1531049919
happytrailz1938,It never ends. Even after leaving the desk,"Ok so I moved and got a new job at a big company (fortune 50). When I got the job it was a huge step up. I am now an engineer. I rarely take calls or do desk side support unless it is something weird or I have it scheduled. Yesterday, after a two hour architecture meeting I was walking back to my desk. The director for my division is wandering around my section (windows engineering). I ask him if he needs anything and he says he can't find anyone but I'll have to do (he reviewed my resume when I was hired and knows I did tech support). He says there is a Windows 10 problem with one of the executives. 

We head over to the executive team. They explain the issue (constant lockouts from their windows 10 PC).  I am not above desk visits for software I customize and support. I rushed over. They tell me what's wrong and how to fix it. I fix it in 2 minutes (cleared credential manager). They look at me and say that was really professional and very good support for an engineer. I find out later that desktop support was only given 2 minutes to respond to a ticket before he went looking for me and that they knew how to fix it the whole time but wanted to see if the team knew. I missed my next meeting to go over requirements for a rollout for their test. I thought I was done with this when moved to engineering. 

Tldr got brownie points for being a good support representative while in engineering and missed an important meeting for a ridiculous test that wasn't even pointed towards me. When you leave the desk the work always seems to follow you. ",talesfromtechsupport,840,1531006927
iwashere33,"ticket closed. no, now closed. nope, closed again.","(not my story, but a friend of mind. I had a chuckle though)

I sometimes get to see history of a ticket when I am looking at a new job. I received a call about a printer not working and saw this in the history, the important thing is that users can open tickets, and re-open tickets if the issue isn't actually fixed, it is meant to indicate bad tech's that just close tickets without doing anything but my mate had to explain what the story was with this as it was ""flagged"" for re-open. It should also be noted, that this is all the same user. Important note: the ticket system is all online through an internet facing page (not intranet, internet) as some tickets are raised by outside contractors and remote users. 

user: ticket open - printer not working every day

tech: ticket response - more information required, printer location and do mean the printer is broken and not working?

user: the printer is located downstairs in the warehouse, and it will print for the accountant and then everyone else but the next day it will not print until the accountant prints again

tech: thank you for the info, I am heading to that printer now. will update ticket with result soon

tech: ticket response/update with resolution.  found that accountant was plugging in the previously networked printer via USB to laptop which was then shared via windows network share. removed cable and networked printer to LAN cable. tested printer via LAN and all works ok. Ticket closed.

\~1 hour later\~

User: ticket re-open - printer not working every day. 

tech: this issue was already reported and fixed earlier today, can you confirm this is the same issue with the same printer in the warehouse?

user: yes, and it does not print any day that accountant is out.

tech: as per above ticket response, this issue has been fixed and the printer was tested to be working. Please open a new ticket if there is an issue with your workstation not printing. Ticket closed.

\~30 mins later\~

user: ticket re-open - printer not working every day

tech: is this that same issue with the ware house printer again? if so, can you please confirm that your workstation is the only one with the problem or is anyone else having the same problem. 

user: yes, my workstation is having the issue. 

tech: is anyone else unable to print? it might just be an issue with your workstation. I will come down to your computer and see if it is a local problem or the workstation itself. as the printer has been tested as working on the network I will close this ticket and create a new one if your workstation still has an issue. 

tech: update/resolution - tested workstation of user when user was not present (whole office was on lunch break) tested network printer located in warehouse. test successful, no issue found. ticket closed.

\~1 hour later\~

user: ticket re-open - printer not working every day

tech: can you please confirm if this is the issue as report as the start of the ticket history? the warehouse printer?

user: yes, i can't print to that printer until the accountant prints. I really need to get this fixed because the accountant is going away for all of next week.

tech: this printer has been has been tested as working on the network, and your workstation has been tested as working to that printer. Can you please confirm that you will be at your workstation so that I can come to you and see this issue you are having?

user: no, i am not at work today, I am at home. I have been sending my printing to the accountant that sits in the next desk to mine and he takes is laptop to the printer for me. I need to be able to print when he is away. 

tech (internally screaming at the sheer disconnect of logic here): in order to print to that printer you would need to be connected to our network internally, for example, from your workstation. when you are in the office please test the printer from there, if you still have an issue you can raise a ticket. ticket closed.

Radhil,No Good Deed Goes Unpunished,"Previous story from the silly datacenter in the middle of nowhere [here](https://redd.it/8w494i).  By request, I have one more to share from this place.  Will try to cut down the ramble (yes, this was longer), add more four-part harmony and feeling.

**Background** - My career so far has been a series of IT gopher positions, where I have learned near every subject in depth because no one else could or would.  My previous job had a large database oriented system... lets call it DB600.  Biz had bought this app to run on, but the system was an arcane and magical black box to all the muggles.  Once I came on as gopher, I got shown a dinky SQL prompt and was told ""make all the reports"".  So I learned SQL, and I did.  Lo, the gopher became the wizard, I pried many secrets from the arcane DB600, and I was even modifying the core app and writing simplish programs (lets call the language ""BFG"", it amuses me).

With all my ad-hoc learning though, I was pretty much a competent amatuer.  I longed to learn the ""right"" ways, from real pros.  Thus my pilgrimage to the datacenter, who had a DB600 that needed overseeing, and the holy mages of programming, who said ""Shaddup kid, you don't know anything, and we're too busy to babysit, so do what we tell you and dont touch our stuff.""

Le sigh.

**Here we go** - The operator gig on DB600 used a simple custom tool to process and log incoming backup and job requests, sending pop up messages to let us know what needed doing and telling users to get out.  It didn't control the entire system, just the part they wanted more order on.  Maybe a year or two in, said tool starts losing jobs here and there.  We'd get an incoming notice, acknowledge it, and then just find nothing available to run.  We work around it, or user resubmits.  Time goes on, problem gets worse.  Problem gets documented, system programmers take over.

Their response:  
- The problem is caused by duplicate records in the tool's history database. (er, how'd they manage that, but ok, yeah, sure)  
- To correct the issue, we need to purge out of date records from the history. (OK, keeping this year and last year, uh huh, got it)  
- Ops team is directed to use the tool to manually remove these records.  (*thud*)  

... The tool does have a function to view history, page by page, and remove entries, one by one.

My jaw dropped.  I checked my understanding with my $coworker, and his jaw dropped.  We asked for clarification, and got it.  They seriously wanted us to go through some 7-8 years of history and purge the history file line by line.

Being a dutiful sort, my $coworker started.  I helped streamline where we could, but at our best guess, with one person dedicated on it, we *might* get done in two weeks.

The more I saw him work it, the more the monotony, the repetitiveness,... the sheer *stupidity* crushed me.  *There was zero reason to do things this way in a database system*.  I absolutely knew that.  I hadn't heard of any crush project or programmers burning the midnight oil.  The only logic would be keep-our-tape-slingers-busy, or just plain spite.  And I got pissed about it.  More pissed I got, the more I indulged my unprofessional side and put my wizard hat back on.

Need more info.  
What database is this in?  
Check $coworker session locks.  He's using the same $TOOLDATA tool always uses.  
So there's not a ""history"" file, just one file. Tool must present a view for new jobs and a view for old jobs.  
What can I find out about this file?  
No access to that.... No, not useful.... Ah! Here's the file layout!  
Just the fields we see in the tool.  Submitted timestamp, job number, user details, release details...  
Job number is the index field?  8 digits long.  Even I know the system re-uses them eventually. Not a timestamp, or a combo?   
No wonder ""duplicates"" popped.  Bad design from the start.  
Still can't work the file though.  I need the data too.  
Start ""BFG"" tools... access denied, not surprised.  
Start data file utility... access denied.  
Start query manager... access denied. *sigh*  
Start SQL tools... access denied.  
Start dinky SQL prompt.... HELLO WORLD.  Careful now, step by step, don't screw up.  
SELECT * FROM $TOOLDATA;... its all there.  Only diff between old records and new records is release timestamp.  Scroll through a lot to make sure.  Can even see the recorded job numbers cycle back to 0000, two or three times since this record started.  
SELECT * FROM $TOOLDATA WHERE SUBMITDATE &lt; lastyear;...  review data rows again, slower, to make absolutely double-sure I caught only what fit the purge criteria.  
Hey, $coworker, stop that and back out of the tool a moment.  
Change SELECT * to DELETE.  Try not to flinch.  Hit enter.  
Start up tool.  Check history.    
I just saved us weeks of useless stupid busy work, by spending a little over an hour learning their setup.  
Document steps taken and inform.  

Supervisor calls me over later that day to issue me a formal written warning, approved by everyone upstream, for failure to follow instructions (absolutely true), and failure to use test environment to test my solution (true, but bullshirt, we werent even given logins for it).  $Coworker thanks me profusely.  Double-check two days later, yep, locked out of dinky SQL prompt.  
  
Worth it.  ",talesfromtechsupport,996,1530881641
TheLightningCount1,The files of the VP are missing. Who do we contact? IT? No. The Supervisor of IT? No. The VP of IT? No. The the vp over the server admin? No. Lets call the CIO. Who also does not contact IT.,"So the EVP over sales recently got a new PC and had immediate issues with it. We, in the IT Support area, never knew about the issues. 

Today I get an email demanding my attention at a meeting in the main corporate headquarters 10 miles down the road from the IT facility. I drive over there and immediately walk into the meeting 10 minutes early.

All of the execs, VPs, higher ups, supervisors, and I believe one guy eating popcorn all showed up to watch me get roasted. 

The meeting started out very confrontational with everything directed at me about some issue I had no clue about and some VP who I never met who was pissed her issue was not resolved. Ill skip the preamble and go straight to the head desk. 

After proving beyond a shadow of a doubt, by calling the CIO directly and putting him on speakerphone, I took a look at the issue. 

&gt; $DVP = Dumb VP  
&gt; $Me = Algernop Krieger

&gt; $ME - So you are missing files since getting your new PC?  
&gt; $DVP - Yes. I thought one of the reasons we got citrix was to prevent these kinds of issues.  
&gt; $Me - I can go ahead and look at this to see where you files went. (30 seconds later) Umm... your citrix profile is completely empty. Is your username $DVP?  
&gt; $DVP - Yes, but you wont find anything in there as I don't use citrix. 

Freeze frame. Full stop. Queue the word music from ff7 after Meteor had been summoned. 

&gt; $Me - So you dont use citrix at all?  
&gt; $DVP - No. I hate it, its slow, it reduced my productivity, and generally is not a good experience to use.  
&gt; $ME - So why would your files be transferred over from one PC to another if you never used citrix?  
&gt; $DVP - Citrix makes backups of all files. You said so yourself in your email to me 3 years ago.  
&gt; $Me - Well I was not with *our company* three years ago but I do know the email you are talking about. That only counts for files inside citrix.  
&gt; $DVP - I do not understand what you mean.  

Several people around the room did not either. The more technically inclined did. Several eyes focused on me like a laser while several more started rolling. The guy eating popcorn was eating his popcorn at cartoonish levels now. 

&gt; $ME - *Does not even hide his exasperated sigh.* Imagine this. Say you did not have an office assigned to you.  
&gt; $DVP - I fail to see how...   
&gt; $ME - Just roll with it. Imagine that every day you had to go to a new desk. Also every day you carry around a box with you with all of your office supplies. Now what goes inside the box, stays in the box for you to use. What is outside the box, is lost when you change desks.  
&gt; $DVP - oooookaaaay?  
&gt; $ME - Citrix is that box. Your files are those office supplies. Because you did not use citrix, your files are still on your old PC. I would need that before I can do anything at all to assist you with it.  
&gt; $DVP - Ill have to make a call.  
&gt; $ME - Make it. 

She calls facilities who brings the old laptop up to me. I hook up an external drive to it and startsimply xfer the non appdata side of her local profile and merged it with her new local profile. Its been 6 years since my last local profile transfer. 

The CIO had made it down to the building by this time and was sitting in on the meeting... where I was performing live tech support for a much smaller crowd and the one guy still eating popcorn. (That bag was bottomless)

The local profile xfer went perfectly, I removed all old shortcuts that were to old 2010 office programs and cleaned up any duplicates she had on her PC. 

At the end $DVP questioned CIO on why this took 4 days to fix. The CIO said he send an email over to the server guys as soon as he got it. They responded with the news that she never used citrix and to contact IT to do a local profile transfer. $DVP never responded to the email and magically thought my dept would be able to read her emails. 

In the end the CIO thanked me for my work and told me he would try to get this to our team first since that was company policy. ",talesfromtechsupport,4445,1530827724

$T1: Me!

$T2: Tech 2, my relatively competent coworker

$DL: Dumb lady, a University employee who is responsible for onsite low level support (think “my password isn’t working”) at remote locations




It’s the morning following our 4th of July day off, and I’m approached by T2.

&gt;$T2: Hey $T1, there’s a ticket in the queue from $DL. I reset the student’s password a few days ago at her request and she says it isn’t working. What do I do?

&gt;$T1: I’ll take a look and get back to you.

To the ticketing system!

&gt;$DL: Student still can’t log into her email using [old password].
 
&gt;$T1: Good morning! I see that the student is still having trouble logging into her email. This is because a tech reset her password 3 days ago, so her old password will no longer be functional. She will need to login using [new password].

&gt;$DL: Student attempted to log into email using [incorrect email address] and [old password], but it says her credentials are not correct. She has been locked out for several days now, it is very urgent that she regains access to her email account. 

&gt;$T1: The student will need to login using [correct email address] and [new password]. 

&gt;$DL: The student tried logging in with [incorrect email address] and [new password], but it still will not allow her to log in. 

&gt;$T1: The student’s email address will need to be entered correctly for her to login. She must login using the email address listed in [database] or the system will not accept her credentials. In the email box, the student needs to enter [correct email address], and in the password box she will need to enter [new password]. If she uses [incorrect email address] or [old password] it will not allow her to login. I have tested the correct email and password myself and was able to log in as the student. 

&gt;$DL: The student was finally able to log into her email. Getting her back in took way longer than it should have.

It reminded of something that occurred when I was about a month into my first ever IT job (or any serious job for that matter) at the turn of the millennium on my placement year at university. I was the sole member of the IT department.

The internet went off. In a casual conversation with a user (who I got on with), they asked me what happened. I said the satellite fell out of orbit and its real trouble. 

I did not expect anyone to take this seriously. A few hours later (or however, long it was), when checking my email, I had an email from the CEO (it wasn't a huge company) with all senior managers copied in saying they had heard about the satellite and were very concerned what this meant for our external data and wanted to know what I was doing about it.

I had absolutely no idea how to respond, I was fresh as a puppy. I went to his office and explained it was just a passing joke and the problem wasn't really that big of a deal. Fortunately, he saw the funny side and that was the end of it (at least that was the guise he portrayed anyways).

ITSupportZombie,Tales from Aircraft Maintenance: The End of an Era,"Many years ago, I was an Air Force avionics technician. I had some very interesting experiences while in uniform, some of them I can even share with all of you. This story is of the day that was the beginning of the end of my Air Force career. 

[As mentioned in this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8ozx2m/tales_from_aircraft_maintenance_sort_of_tank_you/), I was injured on the job which resulted in my permanent transition into civilian life and a much better life (it took a while to get here too) as an IT guy.

It was an oppressively hot day (triple digits hot) on the flight line of $deployedlocation, otherwise known as a normal day at $deployedlocation. I had returned to working on jets just days before and was longing for my semi-comfortable previous job running comms at our command post. The days were shorter and didn’t require me to bake in the direct sun or worse in the large and even hotter aluminum cylinders known as C-17’s. I was “lucky” this day, I was working night shift. I am always happier at night. It’s not so bright out, nor does everything metal require thick leather gloves to be touched.

Shift begins and I grab my tool kit and other equipment and head out to the ramp for the first of three landers I will be working that night. I perform all my checks on the generator and AC unit for the jet and do my FOD walk. Once the prep is done, I sit on the Hobart and definitely did not take a nap for about 30 minutes while waiting for my jet.

My radio goes off, announcing “my jet” is on approach as is another jet that is declaring some kind of issue, effectively this call amounts to one step shy of an inflight emergency (IFE). With this call, the fire department and medical are soon standing by just in case. The pilot was vague in his call out.

Fast forward about 15 minutes, my jet is on the ground, parked in its spot and ready to be serviced. I get to work. The first task is to make sure nothing fell off in flight or looks like it will next time it flies. As I am performing my task, I notice the “follow me” car leading the IFE jet into a spot next to mine. I also notice that there is a generator sitting there right about where the inboard engine (#3) would hit it. The driver of the follow me does not see me waving like a crazy person or the generators. 

Bad things are about to happen.

I turn on my marshalling wands and signal the pilot to spot, the jet continues to taxi towards the Hobart. About 100 yards to go. After I realize that the jet isn’t going to stop, I run as fast as I could to move the power cart. Of course this is one of the Hobarts with stuck brakes (about half were stuck). I put my back into it (literally) and push this thing out of the way.

Completely out of breath from pushing the cart, I collapse on the ground in time to watch the nonresponsive jet taxi past. Moments later, my adrenaline wears off and I feel immense pain in my abdomen. I proceed to collapse on the ground and curl into a ball hoping for a quick death, just to make this pain stop.

I was found a few hours later next to that power cart when shift change occurred. After my coworkers were done giving me sh- a hard time for laying around all shift, I am loaded on to that very same jet that had just taxi’d in. It was a medevac mission on its way back to the states and I was on it.

Within 8 weeks, I had my hernia surgery and was back to work. Day 3 back at work, I push another power cart and get another hernia in the same spot, nearly the exact same way. I found out later that the doc who did my first surgery was lazy and went in the easy way. Surgery two, the doc did it right, but it was too late. Permanent nerve damage. I haven’t worked on a jet since that day.

Urban_bear,But youens ran them wires! (end user story),"Another story from my days as a tech support worker for a small ISP in rural Indiana.

Me: ""$typical phone greeting""

Customer: ""My power is out.""

Me: I'm thinking maybe he just got some numbers mixed up and maybe I should just give him the outage number for his electric company. I'm able to quickly pull up his account based on his phone number.
""OK, I have the number for $electriccompany here, are you ready to write it down or would you like me to transfer you to them?""

Customer: ""Whut? Youenz needs to come fix it, youenz ran them whaaarrs"" (wires)

Me: Rather amused at this point ""We ran the fiber optics to your house, but not the electricity. $Electricconpany would need to fix them. Would you like me to transfer you to $electriccompany?""

Customer: now quite upset, starts yelling at me to come fix his electricity because ""We ran the wharrs"" 

Me: I begrudgingly start to open a ticket, whereas before I didn't even feel the need to log the call as it seemed like a wrong number. As I pull up more account information, I see that several set top boxes are up and functioning normally.
""Uh, it looks like your TV service is working, and I also see your data services are up and running too-- did your power come back on?""

Customer: ""No damnit, the power is only out in ma garage! Where youenz ran the wharrs!""

Me: ""Oh, you mean the battery backup for your fiber services? Yes that's installed in your garage. But it seems to be working, I'm seeing a normal battery status from here, so the power must only be out for some of you outlets.""
.....

This leads to me teaching a grown man about GFIC outlets, even though this has nothing to do with our service, all the while with him ranting about how our wharrz messed up his power.

evilfish2000,Coolest family support I have been apart of so far,"Any vital details has been changed for very obvious reasons.

So mom mother calls me up:

&gt; Hey, we are having &lt;very music talented friend we will from call Jeff&gt; over and helping us with your brothers wedding song. He have a problem with a computer. He tries to...

&gt; Me (cutting my mother off): Don't you think it is better for him to explain the situation?

&gt; Mother: Yes you are right. I'll give him your phone number!

&gt; Super!

Jeff is a happy old man, and his personallity is like the perfect granddad. He starts shooting me pictures of some softwere I have never seen before and start talking about a server he can't connect to. This leads me no where, so I ask him if we could do some remote support. He responds back that it will not be possible but he will be over the next day if thats is okay. I tell him it is.

The next day there is a knock on the door:

&gt; Me: Hi Jeff!

&gt; Jeff: Hi, thanks for helping me. Here is the machine.

Jeff hands me this very old laptop. Looks at least 15 years old and I look at it and see a sticker that has been torn off where i can make out ""avy"". 

&gt; Me: What operating system is this running?

&gt; Jeff: Windows 2000 NT (this story takes place in 2018).

&gt; Me (kinda excited): Wow! Really? Well lets see if we can make it work. What is the software you are trying to install?

Jeff: &lt;REDACTED NAME&gt;

&gt; Me: Never heard of it.

We get the computer started with no issues

&gt; Me: Is it this shortcut?

&gt; Jeff: Yes

I click on the shortcut where there is a radar on it. And I get an error message. I quickly figure out that the installation is wrong and I go through the process of reinstalling it. I will skip this part because it just trouble shooting and following 2 guides that are both right and wrong, but I get through it and gets the server started.

&gt; Me: There we go the server is started.

&gt; Jeff: Super, try the client.

I start the client and it pops up fine and suddenly I have a screen of my nations outline that looks like a RADAR picture and all surrounding contries. I look up on the task bar and see plane, boats, tanks, and nuke icons plus alot of other military looking things.

&gt; Me: Err... Jeff... What is this!?

&gt; Jeff: Ohh yeah, is it a program our army used to decifer radar signals and play out war scenarios. It has been decommisioned 10 years ago. I am going to use it for roleplaying games.

So what I have not said yet was that Jeff is a veteran and a highly ranking one at that. He somehow convinced the army/navy of my country to hand him a decommisioned tool that was used by our army for real and is now trying to use it for role playing games in a real world war 2 bunker where collages kids is going to see a scenario play out on a former real life war program, controlled by him.

&gt; Me: WOW! That is cool.

&gt; Jeff: That is not the best part. If I got it working, the army will provide me with a live feed from all radars of the country to get real life data.

&gt; Me: WHAT!?

&gt; Jeff: Cool right. Btw, can you install it on this old desktop to?

TLDR: I did family support for a family freind, expecting it to be just normal computer error. Instead I got to play with software used by the army/navy 10 years ago on an old windows NT machine that is going to be used in a roleplaying game in a real bunker 2 months from now, with live radar feed from my country!

Currently Jeff is sampling the system. If it goes okay I may have an update on how the role playing went in about 2-3 months as I might need to help them set it up.",talesfromtechsupport,1768,1530390260
Dielyr,I've received my first free request from a stranger.,"It has begun. This is a minor case compared to many, but it's significant to me as my first unsolicited tech support request.

I'm halfway done with my computer science degree and while I help immediate family out with tech stuff from time to time, this one's a first. About an hour ago, I got a call from someone who I don't know at all. I didn't hear the phone, so she left a message:

&gt; Hi, **Dielyr**, this is **JaneDoe**, I'm having a problem with my computer and talked with **FamilyMember** last night who said you could help me. I just need some help getting Microsoft Word compatible with my device, so that I can open resumes. Please call me back at your convenience.

Along with a text message from **FamilyMember** who almost never texts me: 

&gt; Good morning. Hope all is well. My friend **JaneDoe** is gonna call you this morning. She needs your advice on some computer questions and your dad said to ask you cause you can probably help her. I hope you don't mind. Thanks honey, enjoy the day.

They're seven hours away. I'm going to have to talk this woman through installing Word on what is apparently a vague nonstandard device over the phone with no visual, for free. Since my father refused to help I'm pretty sure it's macOS, which I have no experience with (so wish me luck with describing how to navigate the UI to where she needs to be, as I don't even know what the UI looks like...).

Spitfire_SVK,You want earn money on poor people suffering with cancer!!," Hello everyone,

Been suggested to post this here as you guys would enjoy this story

Just one thing on beginning: My English is poor, so please excuse my grammar, formatting, etc...

This happened 3 years ago when I joined small IT company. I started as the IT Technician dedicated to offer support on site with servers, computers, emails, etc. However, in not that busy time I’ve been asked to do some “laptop” repairs in our workshop. At that time, I did not have much knowledge about hardware in cheap laptops like the one that this story would be about.

Everything started at one day when I did not have nothing to do, so I’ve been asked to assist Workshop manager by helping with some of the jobs or with booking of the jobs to the workshop. Older couple walked in to our workshop with cheap laptop. Let’s call the brand of that laptop **H**arry**P**otter. They complained about slow speed and some of the keys on laptop have not been working. So, I took their details and explained, that we are limited with the things that we can do with keyboard to fix it and we might would need to replace the keyboard.

Workshop manager told me that this job should be simple for me and to have a look at it straight away, so I did. I booted up the Laptop and realized that there was barely 1 letter that was working. Usually replacing keyboard is much cheaper then trying to fix faulty one. I took out the keyboard, connected external one then proceeded to look on performance issues. Taking away unneeded start-up entries and services rapidly increased performance of the laptop. After this initial work I called the customer that the performance issue was resolved, and the keyboard would require to be replaced. I quoted them our minimal bench fee (around 30£) and price of the new keyboard (around 12£). Keyboard arrived, and I did connect the new keyboard. After that laptop refused to boot up. Fast forward this was caused by keyboard, but because my poor knowledge in laptops hardware I told customer that the motherboard failed (Yeah, funny I know). They said that this is strange and mentioned that they will get their son to call us as he is working for brand HarryPotter.

Next day I received call from “John” and said that he is from head office of HarryPotter (And indeed he was, as I found later through some searching on internet). He proceeded with questions like: Have you been using Genuine keyboard, have you been doing work on anti-statics matts, etc… After these questions has been answered mostly with word Yes, he then proceeded that he thinks that I want to scam his parents and earn easy money. He also said that this is extremely unacceptable as his father suffering with cancer and I can’t imagine what he had to go through. I did say I did not quoted them more then our minimum bench fee and, I did not offer them any replacement of their laptop, so with all respect I don’t know why he does have that feeling. Also, I said I know how people with cancer suffer as my Grand Mother died because of cancer.

After my Workshop Manger found where I did the mistake I called him and apologised for my mistake and said that we will fix that. He replied that he is not interested, and his parents will collect the laptop and he will fix it for them.

They collected laptop and I though this would be end of that. After two months they came back to our workshop with laptop which was completely stripped down and broken motherboard in half. They said his son couldn’t fix the laptop and he damaged motherboard. We told them that the motherboard can’t be fixed, and replacement would be beyond economical repair and we offered them new laptop. They agreed, and we transferred all their DATA to new machine.

My Workshop manager decided to call customer's son after they visit us for second time, just for the fun. Workshop manager was asking something like we need to find what happened with this laptop as your parents could not explained it to us. He was trying to blame us for breaking M/B in half and lot of different BS. He newer really admitted that he broke the motherboard.

In the end they been so impressed how we prepared new machine for them and with the performance of new machine, that they decide to sign maintenance contract with our workshop and mentioned that they would never ask their son to fix their laptop.",talesfromtechsupport,1203,1530185344

leftmostpuddle,There are dinosaurs coming from the fiber optic cables outside.,"Obligatory ""this didn't happen to me"", but still one of my favorite tech support stories I've ever heard.   


Unimportant backstory: I was having some issues with my cable box not displaying a certain channel (if you must know, I just really needed to watch Law &amp; Order re-runs and that was the only channel not working). This turned into 2+ hours of system resets, updating firmware, a bunch of things I don't understand but the tech finally got it working.   


As we had a solid 2.5+ hours on the phone, with a majority being waiting time, we wound up chatting and I asked him about his most ridiculous IT story. Hilarity ensued.   


$TS: tech support  
$OL: old lady  


In the area $OL lived in, they had just dug up and placed underground fiber optic cables. $OL calls in to tech support with an...unusual issue.   


$OL: ""Due to the new cables underground, dinosaurs have been coming out at night. I need this fixed immediately.""  


($TS could barely breathe while telling me this story, and assures me this is 100&amp;#37; what she said, in a very matter-of-fact tone).   


$TS in his infinite wisdom, decides that there is no way possible this lady will be happy with being told, ""That is impossible."" Instead, he tells her, ""I am so sorry, that is an issue we have been having with the new cables. Right now I will reset the system, and this will no longer happen.""   


$OL was satisfied with this and hung up.   


I deal with some interesting characters at my work, but this takes the cake on the weirdest story I have ever heard. ",talesfromtechsupport,715,1530070830
TheTechStewart,Free service for family will always come back to bite you.,"Inspired by [Streaming Services Require Internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8md57c/streaming_services_require_internet/), I bring you my tale of woe.

A few years back, my mother was ""employed"" by a local businessman who ran his various companies out of his own home.  She evidently did some bookkeeping of some sort for him, and used her personal computer to do so.  Evidently, the guy was reluctant to let my mother connect to his personal network, so he configured her laptop to connect to the $localISP public access points, and used his own UserID/Password to authenticate past the captive portal.  The ISP in question happens to broadcast their ""Public"" access point from almost every residential Router/AP combo that they install, so my mother had internet access seemingly everywhere she went.

Fast forward about 3 years, and Mom moves into my apartment building.  Naturally, with me being in an apartment 2 floors below her, I automatically become tech support.  Again.  I moved out over a decade ago to escape this!  Regardless, I was able to deflect most of her requests by gently explaining that I'm a Linux Sysadmin, and therefore have absolutely no idea why she cannot do XYZ with her Windows computer.  (Sssh.  That's my excuse.)  This worked up to a point, but eventually her laptop powered off for the last time.  Being that I'm the one who selected and purchased the machine a few years prior, ownership of the problem naturally falls to me.

After the machine showed up at my front door, I proceeded to break out the tools and tear it down.  The motherboard's shot.  The main CPU fan hasn't been spinning for who knows how long, the innards are clogged with bed fuzz.  The dodgy power adapter that's serving as her third replacement tests good on my bench after cleaning it up and patching some insulation, but it likely had a hand in the machine's demise.  It's not worth my time to chase parts and attempt to service this machine, so I order a cheap Dell business class notebook off Ebay.  The system shipped without an OS, and I don't own a Windows license.  I throw Ubuntu Linux on-board, give Mom a primer on how to connect it to her network and use it, and shoo her out of my apartment so I can get back to work that actually pays me money.

The follow-up call comes in promptly.  She can't connect to Youtube.  I try to remote in, but TeamViewer doesn't show her machine online.  I ask whether she's connected it to her wireless.  I get a quizzical silence in response, so I grab another laptop for testing and hike upstairs to check things out.  I ask where her router is - there's not one.  I ask who she pays for service - she doesn't.  It hits me - she's been using $localISP's free-for-customers hotspot feature for years, piggybacking off her former employer's account credentials.  The idea of paying for internet simply never crossed her mind, she's had it everywhere.  I connect the machine, point her to the captive portal, and ask her to log in.  I get a blank stare in return.  She has no idea what the credentials could be.  Her former employer had shut up shop ages ago and even though they were still friendly, he no longer had a login for her to use.  But how had she retained connectivity up until this point on the prior laptop?

I'd always suspected that $localISP wasn't authenticating the captive portal login every time, and was instead likely using the MAC address to whitelist clients.  I rushed downstairs and grabbed the WLAN card from Mom's old laptop, which was in bits on my dining room floor.  I installed a macchanger app, configured the new laptop's card to use her old card's mac, and SUCCESS!  Well...until a reboot.  The MAC address reset every time the machine restarted, or even if the system was powered on for long enough.  Frustrated with troubleshooting my hack, I decided to swap the old card into her ""new"" machine - after living for years with IBM/Lenovo hardware whitelists on my ThinkPads, I thought the chances of success were slim.  But, upon reboot, the machine's (downgraded) network card connected immediately to the $localISP hotspot.

Looking on the bright side here,  I got the significantly better AC card in trade for the  N card I swapped in from the old laptop.  Mom gets to stream Youtube to her heart's content, and continue her apparently eternal free ride on $localISP's network.  I just pray that that machine never breaks.",talesfromtechsupport,1102,1530043727

UpUpLeftLeft,Public announcement - Don't build an office in a concrete basement,"Few months ago, my client was doing a refurb of a few rooms inside a swanky downtown hotel.

They decided the carpark basement would make a great location for a site office. 

I was called to discuss internet options, I straight off the bat advised that a basement will be a very difficult place to run an office for comms, but was assured that the staff will make do with the realities of life in the basement.

I attend site, and as guessed, there was zero mobile phone signal, meaning options for running mobile internet are out. I discover that they have a booster signal for a particular phone provider, but it's weak as hell and unreliable as anything. 

I advise them to negotiate to have internet provided to them by the hotel or provision their own, this advice falls on deaf ears and Financial controller says they have a 4G site kit and let's test it out (because it's free).

I advise against it, but test it out, it's unstable as hell, but it works. I advise not to rely on this, and to negotiate internet connection with the hotel. I speak with and email all of the people involved advising to TEST THIS OUT and LET ME KNOW the results, so I can provide recommendations (which is to provision their own internet).

So a week or two goes by, people start arriving to the office, and our helpdesk gets complaints.. site users start emailing my boss saying this is ""unacceptable"" and I get ""What the hell is going on over there"" emails. I again, engage all of the stakeholders, repeat the previous message that this was a TEST PHASE because IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WORK and we SHOULD PROVISION INTERNET but they ask .. ""What about the guest WiFi network?.. can't we use that?""

I advise THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WORK and YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PRINT WITHOUT SWAPPING NETWORKS and YOU SHOULD PROVISION INTERNET but I go out.. find the PUBLIC WiFi signal isn't strong enough, and the GUEST network requires authentication. I leave stating they need to get a Guest logon for me to test, they say they will and get back to me, I leave.

They complain, saying the internet still isn't fixed and this is unacceptable, I say do you have the guest logon?, they say yes, I say have you tested it, they say no. So I go out, test it out, it's weak and pretty crappy, but usable.

I let all the stakeholders know, yes the guest network works but the signal isn't the best, you SHOULD PROVISION INTERNET but they ask.. what about the public network..  Joe bloggs tested it and said it's fast, I say the signal strength isn't enough to reach in the office, so they contact the hotel asking for it to be extended.

So today, after this painful journey, the hotel agrees to be able to move the WAP that broadcasts the PUBLIC network (very fast) so we go out. My tech moves the WAP to near their office, connections are great, full signal strength fast internet, great. Only problem is they have to disconnect to use their printer, I have explained this several times and everyone has agreed.

  
Except for new Site Forman, never been involved, never spoken to anyone, self appointed head honcho says to my tech ""You aren't going anywhere till you fix this, if you can't fix it I'll find someone who will"". 

Baffled my tech calls me saying that new site forman is demanding we fix it (Fix what? I am thinking.. this is exactly what has been agreed to). I call Financial controller to get this guy in line.. he is on leave, I call office manager who said ""I don't really remember what the issues were.. could you go over it again?"" 

So I have to call this guy, listen to his heavy breathing and completely oblivious ramblings like Donnie from the big lebowski completely out of his fucking element, and I have to explain to him the realities of life. Then, out of the blue, he says he has approval for running cables out of the basement, into the golden sunshine to allow a mobile signal booster to be installed (this has been denied for two months that this was possible). So while I am organizing this, he sends an email to all people involved advising this is SUPER URGENT and UNACCEPTABLE and that the current options WILL SIMPLY NOT WORK.

After being ignored every step of the way, being forced to work with solutions that I KNOW will fail, and finally dancing to the beat and getting exactly what was agreed upon working, I get an ear full from someone who had not the time nor the inclination to get involved. Pure frustration in it's finest form, I have flash backs to that phone call that started with ""We are going to be building an office in the basement"" and which I had of hung up right there and then and gone on leave for two months.",talesfromtechsupport,2615,1529982703
muzzsjm,User cannot cope with height of monitor after PC removed,"Another tail from the organisation I'm a service desk manager for.

We had an agile/smart working role out recently. 200 computers replaced with docking stations and converted to touch down desks that users book as and when they need them. 

All the old dual core Dell Optiplex 760s were replaced with HP Elitebooks 8gb RAM and SSDs. So users complain about laptop screens rather than appreciate they have a new superfast laptop with wifi they can use to work from home on.

Anyway a lot of the monitors were sat on top of the computers so now they are wrong height and a certain user kicked off big time. As a temp measure whilst waiting for a laptop/monitor riser we used a box file or told users to use a box or paper, not ideal but would be fine for a day or two whilst we get arms or risers. The user still kicking off writes an email copying in me, the accommodation lead, various HR reps and a project manager.

Needless to say one of HR managers was not happy and setup a quick meeting next to the users desk with me. From an IT point of view not really much I could do other than tell the user to use books or a boxfile. The user there and then threatens to stay at home due to a neck condition refusing to work because the monitor is either too low or too high. Brilliantly the HR manager asks the user to step aside, sits down, adjusts the users chair and then shouts problem solved.

Needless to say the users was red faced.",talesfromtechsupport,3450,1529925352
tabascodinosaur,Wireless Data Transfer in action!,"As I've posted here before, this story isn't mine, it's my partner's, as I don't work in tech, he does. Regardless, it's truly one worth sharing, out of the many, many I wish I could share, and I'll try to do it justice second-hand. 

My partner is a engineer for a large medical records and billing firm. He had a client get bought, and the parent firm was switching their systems over to one of their competitor's systems, so they sent them a data locker with a few terabytes of records. When the locker reached the client, the firm then received a distress call from the client. 

$client = client contact, has received the data locker

$hd = support staff receiving the front line call. 

$eng = engineer receiving the distress call escalation. 

This is our setup! 

$hd: Hello, this is [firm] support, how can we help? 

$client: Hi, yes, your data isn't working!  

$hd: Alright, let's try to figure out what's wrong. 

$hd is a bit out of their league here, so escalates it to engineering quickly. They're used to resetting passwords and dealing with client interface issues, so this is fine. Engineering then takes over the call. 

$eng: Hi, yeah, we are trying to figure out why you're having issues. Can you see any of the file system? 

$client: No, it's not showing up! I think this thing [data locker] is busted! 

$eng: Well, do you have it connected properly? 

$client: Of course I do! I'm sure it's an issue with the device. 

$eng: Can you open the device manager and tell me if the device is found by your PC? 

$client: No, it's not showing up at all! 

More troubleshooting ensues. 

$eng: Well, can you send me a picture of the device? 

$client: Sure, but I don't know what good it'll do. 

Picture comes through. Data Locker is sitting on top of her PC tower. No cord, no power, simply sat on top. I now have seen a picture of a Data Locker sitting on top of a tower, with the body of the email saying ""I don't know what I'm doing wrong!"" ",talesfromtechsupport,1556,1529853426

&gt; $ft: No you don't get me. With everything dark I mean EVERYTHING's dark... Literally. There's no staff here except for the gatekeeper and the whole plant has no power.  
&gt; $ft: The gatekeeper told me they're on company holiday and the power supply is turned off for maintainance.  
&gt; $me: I'll call you back, gonna call $cu now what's going on.  

Ofc we need power for our machines to be able to do our work. It's not like we could check it simply by looking at it.  
Furthermore there must be someone of the customers guys around while our tech is working, simply so they can't say afterwards we broke it if something needs to be fixed (we learned that the hard way)

&gt; $me: $ft just arrived at your site and told me the power is turned of and there's noone around.  
&gt; $cu: Yeah. We planned the maintainances to be done during our holiday so it won't affect our production.  
&gt; $cu: I know you guys and $ft. Just go ahead and do your work.  
&gt; $me: Well... We need the power to be turned on at your site in order to do that. Could you send someone over to turn it on?  
&gt; $cu: Eeeh. Can't do that.  
&gt; $cu: We're replacing our transformers and disassembled the old ones. The new ones will be delivered in 2 weeks.  
&gt; $cu: You'd need to wait until then.  
&gt; $me: ...  
&gt; $me: Look sir. We can't do our work without power. I can't let $ft stay at your site for 2 weeks waiting for you to get the power working.  
&gt; $me: If you can't get the power working there's no chance we can do the maintainance now.  
&gt; $me: I'm going to cancel your order but you need to pay the travel costs for $ft and the time he waited at your company  

I'm skipping the $cus complaining here, it would be too long.

etwasred,"When blind luck is better than skill, or IRL Nat 20","Background : I'm still quite new to the tech support stuff. Only been doing it for six months or so now, and my technical background is more hardware than software- I'll happily solder on some circuit boards, but right now, I'm doing Tier 1.5/2 stuff supporting a government facility. 

My facility was in the middle of a tech inventory, which meant by our policies we were going to be on lockdown for issuing or returning computers for a few days. Not really a big deal, as our stuff is (mostly) reliable, and we have a solid team to ensure we're not swapping a good machine for another good machine.

We are also the kind of facility that requires an Operations Center, the nexus of all sorts of high level, 24/7 manned goodness. People across the world call our OC at all hours of the day and night for any number of things. The government entity I work for has spots all over the world that make the OC a requirement to have manning all the time.

The second day of our inventory, I got a ticket in for a critical computer in the OC. It controlled some unique systems (Deliberate vagueness here) that were not used anywhere else on site, and possibly across our Gov't Entity. And the problem was, they forgot the bloody login!

Psht, no problem for a mighty IT dude with his wallet of admin credentials. Off I go to the OC to have a whack at this misbehaving machine. When I get there, I find it's an older box compared to most, and I settle in and slap it with my admin password.

*DENIED*

Wait, what? I tried twice more, checking my Capslock key and all that, and get denied every time. Before I can really mess with it anymore, LeadMan and TopGun charge into the OC. Both LeadMan and TopGun (LM and TG) are highly skilled in IT, and are the go-to guys for asking obscure information. You know the type I am talking about. Both are solid mentors. LM and TG came because it was a major OC issue, and apparently, the OC had called LM directly to let him know they needed this box up fast as possible.

I was pushed into the backseat (As was right to do on critical stuff) while LM and TG started working. I found out a few things fast from what they were saying- whoever set the computer up failed to set it up to Gov't Entity Standards, and it was not taking any of the default credentials or anything else. LM began to make phone calls to try and prep for a quick swap while TG hammered at the generic admin account with every password he could think of.

LM got off the phone, saying that our many-levels up boss would approve a transfer mid-inventory, but wasn't happy about it. The OC guy asked about the super unique software... which started another round of digging for info. The unique software was nowhere else, but on this machine, and OC guy had no idea where copies were. We sure as hell didn't. OC guy also said the person who put this software on and set this computer up was at some distant base, presently unreachable. TG threw his hands up at this stage, shoving back from the desk and saying he couldn't get in. So I asked if I could try, and got the go-ahead.

I leaned over the keyboard, and then asked the Sky GM for a Computers roll to figure out the password. Sky GM said sure, roll your computers skill, here's all the penalties.

*NAT 20*

The workstation gave a happy little chime and loaded up the admin page. LeadMan, TopGun, and OCGuy were all staring at me as I threw my hands up and said, in front of the entire OC, ""BOOM! I'm fucking GOOD!""

Both my LeadMan and TopGun demanded to know what the password was I had thrown in. I kind of grinned and said ""Well, we're in the Operation Center, so I tried 'operationcenter', and yanno....""

Blind luck trumped well earned skill, on that one rare occasion.

GrowingTech,"Because The Trial is on Here, I Expect You to Give Me the Full Version For Free!","I don't know what it is with my company and working with consumers who think [they are entitled to Microsoft Office,](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8qzprs/replacing_your_lcd_screen_would_not_have/) but this particular story happened just a few weeks ago at my current job. Hopefully this is the last Microsoft Office story I have for a very long time. TL:DR at the bottom if you don't want to read this.

# PREFACE:

So a bit of background information before I get into this story, **you can skip this if you have already read my previous story about MS Office**\- So I work at a company that sells and repairs computers. Very small company, the computers are more expensive but what we offer with us over places like Best Buy is warranty- free lifetime labor warranty for as long as you own the computer. It's really helpful for a lot of old timers because we're basically their IT Department. Problem is, consumers are stupid so we get stories like this every once in awhile where they expect the world.

# THE STORY:

It was another beautiful day at work! My manager and I were closing and we weren't too crazy busy during our last few hours in the store, suddenly we get a phone call... he answers it and then gets busy. Suddenly, another phone call- I answer, and boy- was I in for it once again.

&gt;$Me: *Company Name*, this is GrowingTech- How can I help you?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Customer: Hi, I have this computer I purchased from you guys, but it keeps telling me I have to activate my Microsoft Office before I can use it?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: I can look up to see if Office was included with your computer, can I grab the name on the account?

So the customer gives me his name, and all seemed normal at first. **In case you don't know-** Office is not a free product. It may have been included on some old computers like Dell and HP back in XP and Vista days depending on what computer manufacturer had what deal with Microsoft, which has caused a lot of people to be pissed when they find out they have to buy it now because the common misconception is that it was once free... no, not the case.

Regardless, I look up the customer's profile. Our database shows a customer's history- every time they bring it into any of our locations, it keeps track and tells us what we did, why it was brought in, if they purchased anything, etc. I see that his computer was purchased back in 2014- wait... the dude is just finding out now he doesn't have Microsoft Office? I put him on hold for a bit and start searching his history, making sure we didn't do a reformat on the computer and never bothered to activate Office- nope- he's only brought the machine in for tune ups- and if you don't know what that is- trust me, it wouldn't have deactivated his Office.

I keep searching, finding that he has had no purchase of Office through us. I take him off hold and tell him my findings- and it went on from there.

&gt;$Me: Hi sir, I am back. I have went through your entire history from when you bought the computer to the last time you came into the company- we have no records of you purchasing Office. You'll have to purchase it in order to get that Activated so you can use it.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Customer: But... it's included on my computer! Nobody every told me it was a trial!

Actually- unless the person who sold the computer to this guy was a complete moron- we would have told the customer that. But this was 4 years ago, and why he is finding out he doesn't have Office now is beyond me- he apparently doesn't need it that badly but whatever, my personal opinion. Either way- this is the case of the Customer Conveniently Forgot An Important Detail disease.

&gt;$Me: We normally go over this information with our customers, I apologize but you will still need to purchase it in order to use it.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Customer: Well because it came included with my computer, I expect you guys to activate it for me.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Sir, Office by default of the Windows 10 Operating System comes included as a trial.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Customer: I don't care, I want you guys to give it to me for free because it is on my computer.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me (Starting to lose my patience- did I forget to mention that I despise retail?)  : ....Sir, you could go to Best Buy or any other retailer that sells computers and buy a computer from them- but the trial edition still comes included on those computers as well, this isn't any different with our company. Office comes as a trial as part of the Windows 10 OS, you have to purchase it separately- this is the case of whether you go here or another retailer.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Customer: I understand that but still- nobody told me about this and I expect compensation for that! Where's a manager?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: He is with another customer, I can take down your info and have him call you when you are free.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Customer: Okay, call me at this number, I expect you guys to make this right- and I expect a phone call tonight.

I get off the phone with the customer, manager gets off the phone shortly after. I tell my manager who is rolling his eyes just about as much as I am at that point. I am so happy to work with a manager who doesn't give away free stuff for the sake of angry customers, he told me he would give the guy a deal and it would be $140, still expensive but not full price either- and we would be losing out a little on the license as we don't have any special deals with Microsoft either.

Well, manager calls the customer back... and what do ya know, he had to leave a voicemail! Customer never called us back and it's been almost a month since this happened.

So, not the craziest story- just a case of  ""Expressing my Entitlement"" type of story. Still- I hope my next story for this subreddit doesn't include Microsoft Office anymore.

**TL:DR:** Customer wanted a free copy of Microsoft Office because the trial edition was installed by default on Windows 10 and he ""wasn't told"" when he purchased the computer, Office is not included.",talesfromtechsupport,611,1529691600

Peach=yours truly

Cus:...(after introduction) ....I went ahead and threw them out since they are covered under warranty and I have the receipt

Peach.........

Peach: We would need the defective product. We do not simply replace them at someones will

Cus: It doesnt say that in the warranty

Peach:  The word 'replace' is used several times as well as the phrase 'swap out'. No warranty gives you another device if you throw out the original

Cus: So what do I do here?

Peach: Can you retrieve them from the trash?

Cus: Possibly but I am a music producer and its important for me to have these ASAP so it will be a huge time inconvenience and a financial one for me to have to wait until you receive my broken ones and then ship it back out

Peach: We dont wait for your broken ones to be received prior to shipping out a replacement, we immediately ship the replacement and if your defective ones aren't received then there is a charge imposed. What I recommend is that you purchase another pair, since you need them immediately then try to find the dumpster pair and send them in. Once you receive your replacement, you can return the brand new ones that you just purchased for a full refund.

Cus: This is completely unacceptable-I will be going to corporate &amp; the media about this as well as purchasing your competitors product form now on!

joeborder,"Sorry, was that server important?","The year was 2014, I had been working 2nd line support for around 8 months fresh out of university. It was the final day for one of our Senior Developers before he left the business, he was handing over a number of products - one in particular was coming to me as I had been supporting it since beginning of my time there - the application was about a decade old, written in ASP Web Forms with a backing windows service to read an exchange mailbox, download attachments automatically and read/process the files within. The client for said application had a requirement in their business to respond to files within 48 hours or they would be fined *per violation,* and because of the requirement to read emails on their server, it was hosted in their data centre, not ours. 

**The players**

* $Me/$Op
* $SD - Senior Developer of $App
* $DM - Development Manager, $SD and my boss. 
* $CNA - Client's Network Administrator.
* $CAM - Client's Account manager, his boss. 

**Act I - Setup**

So 08:55 Friday morning. The phone rings, it's first line support saying they have an urgent ticket - not uncommon - I ask who it's for and they say they actually have $client-network-admin on the phone, can he be conferenced in. Alarm bells start ringing, I haven't even had my coffee yet - my PC is still logging in, but I take the call. 

&gt;$CNA: Hi, $Op, we might have a problem with $App.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Okay, whats going on  
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: Well all of the files we've received overnight haven't been processed, they're sat in the inbox.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Oh okay, let me remote onto the server and check it out.

I remote into the server and check out the service logs, endless stacktrace, the job to check the email inbox is continuously failing to make a connection. I check the settings on the app to ensure the endpoint and auth details are correct - no changes or unnecessary deployments made. I ping the mail server and get host unreachable - ah, the mail server is offline. But then I recall $CNA telling me he could see the mail in the inbox, how could he see that if the mail server was offline? I call him back 

&gt;$Me: I can see the problem, your mail server is offline, how is it that you're seeing the mail in the inbox?   
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: Which mail server  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: ...what do you mean which mail server...?  
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: Well we migrated the mail server to our new Exchange box last night  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Did you perhaps do this at \*time logs started throwing errors\*  
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: Yeah that sounds about right.   
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: what did you do with the old exchange box?   
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: Well we decommissioned it  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: You're going to need to restore that server, we cannot read the mail unless we can reach that server  
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: We don't have backups, we're deprecating the box - we've been planning this for months, we have some old disk images but we don't have the hardware, we disconnected it from the rack last night, it's an ancient box and needed to be replaced.   
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Does anybody here know about this? Has $SD been coordinating the migration?  
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: We didn't think we'd need to $App just reads mail from outlook right? The mail clients haven't updated, we just upgraded from Exchange 2003 to Exchange 2010  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: I'm going to have to get back to you $CNA. 

**Act II - Confrontation**

I hang up and go to $SD who is just chatting with his desk buddies, enjoying the start of his final day. Explain the issue, his jovial expression is somewhat ruined. He goes straight to $DM and explains the situation. A loud ""THEY DID FUCKING WHAT"" booms across the office. $DM calls $CAM and takes the call into the meeting room.

In the meantime $SD and I work on seeing if we can get $App to start reading using the new version of EWS, as expected the 3rd party library we used to read EWS would not work with 2010 and the version that would work was so vastly different from our current setup that it would require a fairly extensive overhaul of a large part of the system, and by then we had 8 hours left in the working day. $CNA rings my phone I answer and patch in $SD

&gt;$CNA: So I've just had a chat with $DM and $CAM, they've said I should call you guys and see what can I do to help  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Well you can start by restoring that old box - we've got a few hours left, get it back on the rack, boot it up and do whatever you need to do to get that mailbox running.  
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: Ah, well, we've already redirected all of our traffic to the new box. If we boot up the old one all of our users are going to get locked out of their emails.   
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Can you make it so that only our account is routed to the old box?   
&gt;  
&gt;$CNA: Sounds like a tonne of work - would it not be easier to just upgrade $App to start using EWS 2010

My eye starts to twitch, but then (perhaps fuelled by the knowledge that he doesn't have to care once it ticks past 17:30) $SD chimes in.

&gt;$SD: Are you serious? You switched off an entire server which has housed one of the backbone features of $App for 10 years, you didn't tell anybody at our office you were doing this, your business is going to suffer as a result of this - not only is your job probably on the line for this blunder but I've been working with $CAM since this project started, and I wouldn't be surprised if she's going to be waiting in the car park to beat you up if this isn't sorted by CoB. So don't tell me it'll be easier for us to just upgrade an entire system to an untested, unknown framework. Get that server out of whatever skip you threw it in, get it back on the rack, boot it up, migrate our mailbox and tell us when it's ready to use! 

He slammed the phone down, I heard $CNA mention something about giving us an update in an hour or two and he hung up. There was a tense silence in the office when $DM casually said ""Do you feel better now $SD?"". Everybody laughed and $SD relaxed a little. 

**Act III - Resolution**

The rest of the day went somewhat smoothly. $CNA got the server back up and running, it took a few hours to migrate our mail to the old server and $SD, $DM and I did have to design some on the fly solutions to correct some issues which had been caused by failing to *send mail,* as $App for some reason expected everything to work first time, and had no fail safes in place for when things like email servers weren't there. 

At 5pm we switched the whole thing back on and all the mail pieces started to move, our outgoing mail was re-queued properly and all the data fell into place, crisis averted. 

$SD, $DM and the rest of our office then promptly left the office and went into the nearest pub. $CAM emailed us at 11pm to say that the mail had finished, thanking us for our help. 

**Animal house ending**

$SD - thrived at his new role, we keep in touch on LinkedIn.

$DM - is still as grumpy as ever

$CNA - amazingly kept his job. Thankfully he now informs us every time anything within their server farm changes. He and I have actually become quite good friends over the past 4 years and we have a fairly healthy working relationship. 

$OP - I oversaw the upgrade of $App to use EWS 2010, and after a thorough testing process made the switch. At which point the old EWS 2003 box could be safely thrown in the trash. 

$CAM - Had a great deal of respect and time for $DM and I since that issue. She may or may not have still beaten up $CNA in the carpark. ",talesfromtechsupport,2112,1529584516

&gt;Hello there, I have a problem with my emails, which is that I seem to loose everything for hours then it comes &gt;back again, and I don't know what is happening,  I work a lot at night, and I have watched it, and at three &gt;minutes past midnight, suddenly all the emails for that that day disappear and are gone for 24 hours
&gt;and then it all comes back again a day or two later.  I have watched them disappear when I work at night. I was &gt;working on something last night and it happened again.  All the emails that came in yesterday, Monday, suddenly &gt;disappear, and I won't see them again until Wednesday, when they will all come back again. So I can't reply to &gt;anything that has just come in, because they disappear, and i have to wait a day or two until they reappear on &gt;Wednesday. It's really inconvenient. I don't know what's going on, I hope you can sort it out for me, bloody &gt;computers! Please ring me when you get this, thanks.

I've never met this guy; one of my clients does secretarial support for him, so she referred him to me. I remoted in to his PC once and fished a few lost emails out of his deleted items for him.

I get his message and I'm thinking ""WTF is he talking about? Sounds crazy!""

But, I try and suspend judgement. I don't want to engage with this madness, but I am somewhat curious, so I call him and remote in...

He fires up Outlook 2010. 

First thing I see is ""Date:Yesterday"" is docked, collapsed. Nothing for ""Yesterday"" is visible.

So he is actually describing it as he sees it.

At three minutes past midnight (by his wristwatch) all the emails in ""Date:Today"" are move down into ""Date:Yesterday"", but because ""Date:Yesterday"" is not expanded, they all suddenly disappear. And after he has waited 24 hours, at three minutes past midnight the following day, they will reappear again, as they move down into ""Date:Wednesday"" which is expanded. And then he can reply to them.

So I showed him how to expand ""Date:Yesterday"" and suddenly all was right with the world!

joeborder,Today my User was a pretty cool guy,"Although I am a Dev I occasionally do field support for one of our contracts, I cover the North of the UK while a counterpart in the South covers the other half of the country. 

Somebody called the helpdesk saying that their PC was displaying system time 01/01/2000 whenever they logged in, and it meant security certs weren't valid etc. It's becoming a more common problem as some of the PC's have been around a decade or so and the CMOS batteries are starting to die, so the clock resets every shutdown. The sites can reset the clocks themselves but as its a continuous problem we eventually need to replace the battery. While the tech setup is really low key - it's a medical workstation and has a fairly high impact and when a site can't access the system and needs to use the contingency, the slowdown in productivity can have some fairly dire medical consequences. 

On this occasion the site was slap bang in the middle of the country, technically I was closer by about half an hours drive away, which would be an all day trip out of the office - driving hundreds of miles to replace a battery. The guys on 1st line sent the CMOS battery ahead of time in the post, then called the local IT for the site and asked if they could spare a hardware tech to come out and replace the battery. They refused. We told them we accepted liability for any damage to the machine, and if they broke the PC entirely we'd have to come out anyway to replace it - so either way we had nothing to lose. They still refused on the grounds it wasn't their kit. 

Annoyed (but not surprised) I called the site to arrange a time I could go out and replace the battery myself. This is when I encountered something that had not happened before. I spoke to the medical professional - lets call him John -  explained the situation and asked when was best to come out; his response shook me. ""Just the battery on the motherboard? I've done that before - do you mind if I just have a go?"" I said yes, as whether he broke the machine or not I'd need to be heading out. ""Give me a few minutes, I'll go find a screwdriver"". 

He called back a few minutes later saying that he'd done the switch and the machine was keeping time; but he'd ring back next day to confirm it was working. Called me this morning first thing and said the PC was working fine, and we could close our ticket.

While this story doesn't really have a funny punchline; I thought I'd share it - because in tech support sometimes you just need that glimmer of hope that one day you will get a *John,* somebody who not only understands but cooperates and makes the job just that little bit easier. Thanks John.

M: yes ma'am, you did. And I told you it was part of the SSO. I even tried to get you to try your current network password, but you demanded I reset it anyway. 

S: I have to turn this in today, I can't wait for my manager to come back. 

M: I can email her manager, explaining the situation, and you can try to contact them about it as well. 

S: that is idiotic, why are you doing this to me?! 

M: I simply did as you demanded. 

After a lot of angry bargaining, she came to terms with the fact that I was not going to help her, and reluctantly agreed to contact her managers manager. 

Thing is, when I sent the email after I had released the call, I got an out of office notification from him. He is out till the end of the month.

LeonHeimdall,You know I can still hear you... right?,"Here is a story about why you should watch what you say (to a degree) TLDR at the end.

Before I weave this tale of magic and mystery I need to give a little background. I work at a large university and everything is sectioned off. I work for $primary-HD which applies to everyone. Employees have $departmental-HDs that will do everything beyond password changes/verification/simple web stuff. 

The story's cast: $me (that guy), $C (client - employee of the University), and $CIT (Client's departmental-HD).

$me: Standard greeting

$c: (already yelling) I CAN'T LOG ON.

$me: ...k... may i have your $info?

$CIT: yea this is $CIT and $C here, here is her $info, and as you heard, she cannot log in.

$me: oh, ok, so what are you trying to log into

$C: everything!

\*\*keep in mind that we use about quite a few systems University-wide and each department has their own, on top of that some have different passwords/usernames\*\*

$me: ok, can you log into $main site for the University?

$C: NO 

$CIT: she can't log in anywhere, she just told you that.

$me: ok, let me look over a few things \*\*mutes phone\*\*

\*\*note, we don't really put people on hold at this University, we always just mute ourselves, just in case they have an ah-ha moment or if something pops up on their screen that we need to know, guess they didn't know that...\*\*

$C: \*scoff\* wow, he has no idea does he?

$CIT: Yea those $primary-HD people are really the bottom of the barrel. They don't know anything, just, they are they are the only ones who can do anything with passwords. Sorry you have to deal with him.

$me: \*internally\* well, that's swell. 

Then I notice that the username has NO attempts to log in. No incorrect passwords. Nothing. No access attempts for the entire day.

$me: \*I take myself off of mute\* oh, so I actually don't see any attempted log ins at this time

$C: I am trying to log in right now, did you see THAT?

$me: no, I didn't, but I think I know the issue; $CIT and $C, can you check if the caps lock is on? As you know all of our usernames are case sensitive.

\*\*a hush\*\*

$C: ok I can log in now, thanks.

\*\*I am not done yet\*\*

$me: oh, and just so you know, as your $CIT said, ANY technical issue can be solved by reaching out to YOUR $departmental-HD. We do have training and most have A+ certifications so we can troubleshoot a lot of issues, but the $departmental-HDs have requested to cover any issues you may have, that is why as $CIT said, I am pretty much just a password person. ... anything else?  
$CIT: no... thanks  


BONUS - This call was pulled by our head of IT ($primary HD) and I just saw that the $CIT was pulled into the office. The name of the meeting on his calendar - discussing appropriate banter and relationships with other IT departments. 

TLDR: Caps lock is not your friend and remember that people can hear you.",talesfromtechsupport,1005,1529431451
Santacabasa,What's a Charger?,"I used to work IT in a retailer. Best story by far was when a lady tried to return a laptop because ""it didn't turn on"".

**Me**: Hi, how can we help you

**Lady**: I bought this yesterday and it doesn't turn on. I just want to return it.

**Me**: Okay ma'am let me check it out. do you have the charger for it?

**Lady**: I don't know what you mean, how would I even charge it.

**Me**: \*asks lady to see the box.\* (She brought back everything to return the laptop)

The charger was untouched in the little side compartment of the box. I asked her if I could plug it in, and when i did the Dell logo popped up immediately.

**Me**: Sometimes computers do not come pre-charged and you have to plug them in to power the battery.

**Lady**: Well, Your sales people should really tell people that they need to plug in the computers before they can use them.

She took all of her things in a pout and left. I always thought chargers were a common knowledge (especially someone who looked relatively young)? ",talesfromtechsupport,1041,1529345872
ambercore1000,Is it plugged in? Are you SURE?,"So, back with another tale, this takes place at my first job, when i was studying to work with IT. it was a normal day running without any major issues. Until the phone ringed. 

&amp;nbsp;

**ME** - Only a Student getting the hang of things.

**CU** - Confused User.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**ME**: ""Standard Greeting""

&gt;**CU**: Our internet is down on the whole top floor! Please come out and fix the issue!!!

&amp;nbsp;

Now this costumer has two floors in a ""Business apartment complex"" but is hosting their own IT equipment in their office. This also means that i know at least 20 users is without internet. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**ME**: ""Okay, that's bad. Can i get you to go to the IT room and check if there is light in the humming boxes out there?"" 

(When i say IT room, image a broom closet where the cleanup people store stuff, then just a open rack closet attached to the wall. no doors)

&gt;**CU**: ""Everything is dark! There are no blinking lights?! Is that normal?""

&gt;**ME**: ""No that's not normal. Is there a power cord that is not attached to the power strip?""

&gt;**CU**: ""No everything is attached!""

I spend a couple of more minutes trying to get the user to make sure that the cords are correctly seated in the power strip.

&gt;**ME**: ""Well, then we will have to send a guy onsite. We will be there in around 1 hour""

&gt;**CU**: ""Good! Just hurry!""

&amp;nbsp;

Now getting to the costumer does not take 1 hour, this was just to give myself some time. This was in a major city and taking public transportation was the quickest way to the costumer. So i gathered some tools and went to catch the buss.

&amp;nbsp;

I arrive at the costumer 30 minutes later, walk up the stairs and into their top floor.

&gt;**ME**: ""Hello CU, i am here and i'll just take a look at the issue.""

&gt;**CU**: ""Sure! Do you need anything? I'll just go grab a cup of coffee.""

&gt;**ME**: ""Naa, i'm good! thanks anyway.""

So i go into the ""Server Room"" and plug the switches into the power strip again, and head for the kitchen.

&gt;**ME**: ""So i will be heading out of here.""

&gt;**CU**: ""What do you mean? We cant work? did you forget some tools?""

&gt;**ME**: ""No? The power cord was not attached to the power strip as we talked about over the phone...""

&amp;nbsp;

I end up spending 30 minutes at the location teaching the user how to plug a power cord into a power strip, and give them some recommendations on how to prevent this from happening again. All in all a great day as i did not have to do phone support.",talesfromtechsupport,1940,1529316327

Yesterday, I received a call from a user who I will call Lazy User. (LU) Now, LU was on a call for which a customer was missing some TV channels.


LU has all the tools at their disposal in order to check to see if the customer has the channels on their account. If we see that the customer has the channels on their account but cannot see them, that is when I come in and get that escalated. Here's how the call went with LU.


Me: Tier 2, this is u/devdevo1919.


LU: Hi. This is LU. I have a customer here who's missing some channels.


Me: Have you checked Tool 1 to see if they're paying for it?


LU: Yes.


Me: Okay, show me where it says it in Tool 1. 


LU: It shows it here under *Package*.


*LU was correct*


Me: What about Tool 2?


*This is the tool that matters. It shows us everything programmed onto their account.*


LU: Yes.


Me: Where?


LU *stuttering*: Uh, well, it should be under *Package* like Tool 1.


Me: Did you check under *Package*?


LU: There's a lot of things listed there. 


Me: I know there is. You have to click on each of these and go through them all so we can be sure that the channels are not listed.


*There was about 50 different selections.*


LU: That's a long process, sir. Can I send a ticket or escalate to you?


Me: No, LU. You need to make sure the customer does not have these channels. You know you need to do this. In the time spent with me you could've been checking the sub-packages under *Package* in Tool 2 to see if the customer has the channels.


LU: But sir, the customer is frustrated.


Me: You still need to verify. Is there anything else?


LU: *sigh* No. *click*

SargoDarya,"RAM is an abbreviation, not a command...","This happened at the beginning of my career when I was doing an internship in a PC building and support shop around 13 years ago.

Usually, the way it worked at the shop was, a customer comes in, tells us what he needs and then we would order the components, build the PC and hand it off to the customer. Occasionally though, we also had customers which took the matter into their own hands so we just ordered the components and sold them separately to the customer so he can build it himself.

In came a guy we sold some hardware 2-3 days ago and complains that he inserted everything and plugged everything in but the PC doesn't boot up. We tell him we're going to look at it and if we find something we'll call him and give him a quote. Sure enough, he left and we went to investigate.

After having plugged everything in, we try to power on the machine. Nothing. Our first guess was that he forgot to attach the power pins of the case or the PSU wasn't properly wired up. While the wiring looked a little bit wild, it seemed to be properly connected so that was a dead end.

While looking through the wiring, something else caught my eyes though. There were dents on the RAM sticks edge. 'lo and behold, it seems like the customer had trouble getting the RAM sticks in so he used a hammer to make it fit. 

You know the little notch RAM sticks usually have so you can only insert them one way? Well, apparently the customer didn't and he made it fit the other way around and in that process, broke his mainboard too.

In the end we ordered a new mainboard and 2 new RAM sticks for the customer and installed it for him. He was more than happy to have it working finally. Still baffled though how you can manage to wire up a full PC and then be dumb af when it comes to the easy part.

TL;DR: Customer was wondering why his PC didn't boot when he inserted his RAM the wrong way with a hammer.",talesfromtechsupport,3743,1528974316

bilfred_,"Upgrading network drivers is easy, right?","So I used to work as a trainee at my school (kinda still do work there, not as trainee tho), we were a fairly sizeable school so had equally sized infrastructure to boot. At the time, our core infrastructure consisted of 1 server that performed core roles like AD, user storage, and main network functions (like DHCP and the internet proxy) - with 2 other servers that performed misc services and any custom programs we needed to host.

Because of the size of the school, the core server actually had dual gigabit NICs. But when the server was initially installed, no pairing configuration was set on the cards - so they weren't operating in failover, round robin, teaming. They were just two independent cards. For a long time, we just kinda let it slide because we never had any issues with network performance (if it ain't broke, don't fix it).

Eventually, it got to the point where we were starting to hit capacity on the single gigabit NIC, as the school grew. We knew the server had a second NIC installed, so we planned for some configuration changes in the last week of term.

I am **SO** glad we planned to do it then.

When we went to go down and enable teaming so we could get the full fat 2gbps, the cards' drivers were complaining saying they needed the latest drivers to enable teaming. No big deal, just download the latest drivers and update... right?

We started the driver installer. It started uninstalling the old drivers so it could install the new ones, but then it said to finish uninstalling the old drivers it needed to restart. Yeah, ok, lets restart then.

One small problem (that we didn't realise at the time).
If the network drivers are going to be uninstalled on restart, the system will have no network when it comes back online again. To login to the server, we needed the AD server as there was no local login (due to security policies). The server was the AD server though. 

So now we had no AD. No internet proxy. Luckily, one of the other slave servers was setup as a DHCP failover, so at least the local network kept operating.

Which still wasn't much use, because with no AD no one could authenticate with any of our AD driven services (which most were). And aside from that, no one could use the internet, teachers and students couldn't access their files, printing wasn't working. Pretty much the entire network was brought down.

To try and fix the issue, we had to somehow manage to get a local account onto the machine, use said local account to refresh the network drivers, and remove the local account and login with AD again. This was way too complex for our pay levels, so the head IT guy contacted the regional tech guy (who has more clearance and experience than us to fix these things), who in turn had to contact the server manufacturer directly to be able get this custom software thingy they had to use to flash a local account without breaking any of the files on the server. We never really got told the direct process of how the solution worked, but it took them the entire last week to get the network back up.

The school had no network for an **entire week**. This is why planning ~~outages~~ changes is important.

I work in the home office, so we have a decent number of employees here as well as the upper leadership like CEO, board members, etc.

Apparently, every time she opened outlook it would scroll infinitely, she couldn't get any other programs to open, things were typing strange, just really anomalous behaviour. She'd had the CEO come and take a look as well as one of our nursing co-workers.

They all agreed it was acting strange and to come get me. So, I take a look over her computer. The problem is instantly apparent once she showed me what was happening. When she hit the windows symbol, for example, spaces would be created over and over.

It turns out, she'd laid a clipboard down on her desk, right on her space key. Once the clipboard was removed, the computer started working fine again.

hidesinserverroom,They Aren't Sure What They Are Buying; Saved Ya Couple Ten Grand,"Back for a new adventure that has been running for the past several years. 

So a little back story on this, we have a client that for the past several years asked for an implementation of Sharepoint and conversion of local resources into Sharepoint. All in all this is about a 100 \- 110 hour job for the work requirements between setup, implementation, conversion, design, engineer and on\-site support. This has bounced back and forth multiple times over the years, paused, stopped, re\-quoted, etc. 

This on particular day after some long and lengthy discussion on when this would be ready to begin the scope of work it went a bit sideways. 

At the beginning our conversations we had gone over Office 365 and it's requirements versus an on\-prem solution requiring varying licensing, hardware and software purchases. To our surprise they went with an on\-prem solution, later we would find out that during our discussions on O365, they kept referring to the Office suite of products and didn't seem to understand the Sharepoint part of it. 

Because of their business and size they were offered really aggressive pricing from us, but Microsoft had even better purchasing power, however they decided to spend a couple ten\-thousand with us from licensing, software and hardware. 

Then one day this happened. We get a call saying we need another meeting, after already signing everything. 

* **ME = Well Me**
* **Customer = Well Customer of course**

&gt;Customer \- So we need to talk about the Sharepoint pricing and why you are charging x ten\-thousand dollars for software and hardware  
&gt;  
&gt;Me \- We offered pricing on the base software, all needed licensing and hardware needed to run the Sharepoint instance  
&gt;  
&gt;Customer \- We are interested in other products now rather than just Sharepoint

At this point I go about explaining the on\-prem versus the Office 356 with Sharepoint options, yet again. Giving them examples of our pricing vs Microsoft. It was as this point we also learned they had not involved their IT department until after everything was decided upon. Also learning their internal IT department had explained better pricing via Microsoft vs us and seemed to not believed or maybe understood exactly what O365 with Sharepoint was.  

As such I confirmed what their IT department told them and proceeded to save them oh about a couple ten\-thousand dollars in the process.

harrywwc,sometimes two mouses are better than one,"last year a colleague damaged her right (dominant) arm with an OOU/RSI^* -style injury. This hand, obviously, uses the mouse a lot, and this was causing more than a little discomfort.

At first she tried just moving the mouse across the desk for her left hand to use, but the buttons were (of course) under the 'wrong' fingers. So, she asked me for a second mouse (without explaining why) and she plugged it in, but still had ""issues"".

She finally asked me ""how do I change the mouse buttons?"" and so I showed her where the rodent's settings were in Win10.

But she **still** hadn't explained what was going on.

She struggled along for a few more days, but came to me in frustration (and more than a little pain, no doubt)… ""every time I want to use the mouse on my left hand, I have to go into the settings to swap the buttons. And when I want to use the one on my right hand, I have to swap it back.""

Add to that, the mouse on her right hand was ""too heavy"".

I had a think. She needs two mouses [yes, I know, the plural should me ""mice"" - but a long time ago a certain bunch of 'Murikans deemed that it is ""mouses"" when referring to more than one computer mouse], and she needs the one under her right-hand to be ""right-handed"" and the one under her left-hand to be ""left-handed"". It would also help if the right-handed mouse was lighter than a normal mouse.

Can't do it with the one mouse-driver... hmmmm…

I pulled out a light-weight wireless mouse ($low-GI-tech - although, why you would eat one is beyond me, but ""low-GI"" is supposed to be good for you) and put the dongle in the USB port, loaded the drivers, and configured it as a ""right-handed"" mouse.

Into Windows settings and configured the (heavier / wired) mouse to be ""left-handed"", and she was ""good to go!"" and a happy camper!

tl;dr - see title

postscript - she moved to another job late last year, and called me earlier this year asking ""how did you solve that problem? I need to get the IT guy here to replicate the solution.""

U_RACK_DISIPRINE,Getting schooled by my 78 year-old Gran,"Hi TFTS, unqualified 'family tech-support' here. As oldest of the grandchildren, it has become my reluctant task to help my family with all problems relating to The Google, The Internet Button (ie, IE), and Have You Tried Turning It Off And On Again. This includes increasingly senile Grandma, whom I am visiting for a fortnight to prepare her for a move to hospice in the near future.

Old Gran isn't doing so well after having a couple of strokes. In terms of tech support, she is terrified by anything more complicated than a washing machine, to the point that when her TV showed her an unexpected message last night she turned it off in a panic and had to sit down and take some deep breaths before shakily turning it on again. What she had done was press the 'TV Guide' button. My mum had tried buying her what she thought would be a user-friendly tablet, but Gran was unable to do the quick taps required to push the buttons on the touchscreen, she could only press and hold. All this combined with her general confusion with life has made for a difficult fortnight.

All that said, she still manages to be sweet at times, and  the other day she bought a CD of what she hoped was some good pop music that my generation liked. This CD turned out to be Cliff Richards, which is not my style, but I was touched that she was thinking of me so I fired up the CD player. This is an ancient beast which used to be part gramophone, at least 30 years old. She hadn't touched it since her husband died, but after a dust off and a plug in, it fired up nicely. 

There was one problem though - the CD drawer wouldn't open. There was a big round button that said open/close, and I jabbed away at it, but it wouldn't budge. I tried pressing it from the front, from the side at every angle, even wiggling it in case a wire had come loose, trying to find the magic touch for 15 minutes, but nothing worked. I told Gran that it was busted and prepared to switch it off again, when she suddenly overcame her fear and gave it a poke herself. 

...and it worked. You see, I was using the quick taps that most buttons and touchscreens these days needed, but dear old Gran was pressing slowly and holding, and that's just what the old machine wanted! Sometimes an old machine needs an old touch",talesfromtechsupport,884,1528559554

NYFranc,Human Resources and It's Over 9000! Baby Pictures,"Over the past decade of IT Help Desk/Administrator, I dealt with my share of odd IT requests and situations. These days, I work with a tight\-knit group that provides level 1 tech support to various companies in various industries. Boy, this was a fun one from the Human Resources manager of a fashion company a couple of days ago.

So, it was a typical Wednesday morning at first, I was drinking my coffee with a pair of double chocolate muffin tops. Enjoying the calm before the storm and then the Help Desk phone rang from the manager of Human Resources herself. The HR director developed a reputation of a micromanager with a swift mood swing. So, I braced myself and answered the phone.

&gt;$NYFranc: Good Morning, this is Help Desk, $NYFranc speaking.  
&gt;  
&gt;$HR: Help Desk?! Thank god, I need help. It's Over 9000!  
&gt;  
&gt;$NYFranc: Huh?! What's over 9000?! The NASDAQ?  
&gt;  
&gt;$HR: No, silly man. The baby pictures on my iPhone. I'm not tech\-savvy and I need IT to salvage my baby memories from myself. I ran out of space on my 32GB phone and I want space for the new memories.  
&gt;  
&gt;$NYFranc: You got an iPhone. So, I will assume you got a Apple account. You most likely synced your pictures on the iCloud. You can download the pictures from the iCloud and once that's done. Delete them off your phone and we'll make a few tweaks so the iCloud data don't overwhelm your phone.  
&gt;  
&gt;$HR: I don't remember my account info nor I want to do that. I'm very busy and need an immediate fix.  
&gt;  
&gt;$NYFranc: Ma'am, you're the director of HR. You just called IT Help Desk and **started a ticket using a Dragonball Z reference from a Japanese anime cult classic**. If you want a fix, you will wait until tomorrow morning when I will be on\-site. As soon you arrive at the office, I will gave you my undivided attention.  
&gt;  
&gt;$HR: Are you sure you can't do this remotely? I'm a busy woman.  
&gt;  
&gt;$NYFranc: The call is being recorded and I ain't risking my job over baby pictures. You're the HR Manager, **YOU CAN MAKE PEOPLE WAIT!** If you cherish the pictures of your child that much, your subordinates **WILL WAIT** and when you're good and ready, you'll see them!  
&gt;  
&gt;$HR: You're the 1st tech guy I ever spoke with that convinced me to wait on anything. Fine, but I expect results, $NYFranc.  
&gt;  
&gt;$NYFranc: Deal.

After the call, I informed my counterpart on\-site Help Desk supervisor my plans for tomorrow. He saluted me for taking the challenge. After that, I popped a couple of Tylenol and guzzled them down.

The next day, I got there at 9 o'clock, sharp and entered her office. The HR director smiled instantly and told her subordinates to not disturb her until further notice.

&gt;$HR: You are a man of your word, $NYFranc. I asked about you after our call yesterday. Various staff members told me the same: direct, forceful, smart, punctual, and no.1 rule: make sure you got COFFEE! I wish my husband was that manly. He got money, but that's it.  
&gt;  
&gt;$NYFranc: Thanks, let's get started.

I planted myself down on my Executive Leather chair and she proceed to express endlessly about these three things in this order: 1) iPhone storage, 2) baby pictures, 3) Japanese Anime

I humored her on all three with whatever I knew and then my audit on her phone finished. **IT'S NOT OVER 9000 PICTURES! IT'S OVER 20,000 PICTURES!** Holy smokes! It's a freaking museum to first born children everywhere.

Her face flushed in embarrassment and I calmed her down and told her, ""No worries, it's my job"". 

Then, I began the process of migrating 20,000 baby pictures and moving them into a flash drive. She gave me a surprise hug and talked about her 2nd baby coming in the upcoming weeks. She re\-emphasized that she needs room on her phone to take more baby pictures. I advised her to get a phone with more hard drive space, so this ticket don't have an immediate sequel.

She chuckled and waited patiently for the picture migration to finish. After two hours, it was all done. She gave her thanks to me for my hard work and she allowed her neglected subordinates permission to see her again.

An hour later, the head of IT Operations approached me and told me that he was stunned I managed to shut down Human Resource for two hours. I replied, ""**what's done is done, my friend. I didn't want this haunting me**."" He advised me to be more diplomatic with the other managers and thank me for handling the ticket.

Fribanaw,Changing the password on an inactive account is always a fruitless exercise,"Hi All, infrequent poster, but I don't seem to have many interesting stories that I can post without giving away too much of where I work...

Yesterday however I had a situation come up that struck me as a surprisingly new one for me and my fellow techs in my department (should have suspected it would happen one day, but we didn't think anyone would actually do this).  For quick pre\-amble to explain, I am tech support for an access control system solution.  While I do have back doors into systems, it requires a remote session, and usually either turning on said back door from in the program, or using a physical link to the server via serial cable.

I will be $me and my caller will be $HR for the rather clueless HR director who called.

\&gt;$Me: Thank you for calling tech support, this is $Me speaking, may I start with your name please?

\&gt;$HR: Yes, this is $HR, we have one of your \&lt;redacted, but not event quite correct company name\&gt; systems and my password stopped working, can you reset it for me?

\&gt;$Me: Unfortunately, I do not have any remote administration capabilities to your system to do this, but could I get you to try logging in with the default credentials? They are \*username\* and \*password\*.

\*\*(As a side note, I find it scary how many installers and sys admins leave these at default)\*\*

\&gt;$HR: No, that didn't work, is there any other way to fix my account?

\&gt;$Me: Possibly, is there anyone else in your organization with a working login available right now?  If so I may be able to walk you through resetting your password with that login.

\&gt;$HR: Yes, $HRDrone has a login and hers is working right now

\&gt;$Me: Excellent, here are the instructions for her to change your password for you (Insert simple 5 step process)

\&gt;$HR: Ok, I will get her to do that, I'll be right back

5 minutes later...

\&gt;$HR: Ok, $HRDrone did it, and I can login now, but it says I'm not allowed to do \&lt;insert routine task here\&gt;, also we had to change my username because it said it was already in use.

Had a bit of a sinking feeling here, because as call center tech support, I am being measured on call times, and I feel like this will take much longer than it should.

\&gt;$Me: Ok, would it be possible for us to do a remote session with $HRDrone so I can see what is happening and help fix your account?

\&gt;$HR: Yes, that should be fine, let me transfer you to her

\&gt;$HRDrone: Hello, $HRDrone speaking, how may I help you?

(Great, a cold transfer, I always love those...)

\&gt;$Me: Hi $HRDrone, $HR transferred me to you so we can do a remote session and fix her account up.  Can I get you to go to \&lt;insert remote session website here\&gt;?

(Guidance on getting connected provided here)

\&gt;$HRDrone: Ok, can you see my screen yet?

\&gt;$Me: Yes, can you please open the Access Control system for me now, so I can get things corrected?

\&gt;$HRDrone: Yes, here you go.

At this point, I searched for $HR in their system, and curiously I found 2 listings for $HR, one marked Active, the other being Inactive.  Checking the Active listing, I found an account with no logical permissions, just door access, and with no card/pin set to make use of said access.

I then proceeded to check the ""Inactive"" account, it seems to have full logical permissions to the system, has the original username too.  I changed the account to make it active, and sure enough, the login now works.  Of course, I did not leave it at this, I quickly pulled up an audit on the account, and lo and behold, marked inactive just a couple of hours prior by $HR.

From here, I gave a quick rundown of how $HR broke her own account, found out what they were \*trying\* to do, and advised how to actually do it.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* Changing the password on an inactive account is always a fruitless exercise.",talesfromtechsupport,631,1528471434
Ulfsark,You literally paid us to do that two weeks ago...,"Hey guys, I work for a small MSP that supports mostly schools. Part of that involves using 3rd party software for managing Fruit devices. Generally managing these are pretty simple, get the Fruit devices linked to the system, and push out apps, settings as necessary. 

I receive an email asking if we will be removing the remote management from the new Ipads. By design, when you factory reset the device it asks to be joined to the MDM software again and requires credentials for that to be entered. Turns out they had factory reset their iPads in hopes to connect a new fruit account... (We did not add any accounts to these as they are not needed to get programs as they are managed by the 3rd party program) 

However, what they actual did is undo part of the project they had paid for recently. A few days prior they asked about the fruit accounts , and I had mentioned that they could add a new fruit account in the settings and even remove the current one if it existed,  I explicity said ""You do not need to reset it"" 

Looks like this project is getting a phase two...",talesfromtechsupport,1791,1528437975
bigfatguy64,"""The whole system is down! Get there now!""","backstory:  I (FatGuy) spent a summer working as a sort of IT guy at my Dad's (Dad) office after his long-time IT guy/Office Manager retired abruptly.  This was a small doctor's office with probably around 12-15 employees.  I was by no means an IT expert, but I could fix most of the issues that came up, which 9 times out of 10 were ""the printer won't work.""  in the very rare case that it was something I couldn't solve with a quick google, I knew enough to not mess with anything, and outside of adding a user to the Active Directory once, I generally left the main server alone.

&amp;nbsp;

Most of the women working there (office was pretty much all women) could use a computer well enough to do their jobs and get to facebook but that was about the extent of it.  There was one early-mid 40s big redneck woman in particular that was completely computer illiterate...for the sake of this story, let's call her Kevin.  Kevin had been a receptionist at the office for at least 5 years.

&amp;nbsp;

Scene: 7:30am, morning of 4th of July.  

&amp;nbsp;

Me: passed out after drinking with my buddies the night before.

&amp;nbsp;

Dad: (throws bedroom door open...running in in a panic) **FATGUY! WAKE UP!  There's something major going on at the office.  I think we've got a virus or something!  The whole system is down! You gotta get there now!!**

&amp;nbsp;

Me: Good one dad....it's 4th of July and even if it wasn't the office doesn't open until 9.

&amp;nbsp;

Dad: This isn't a joke.  Kevin came in to get caught up on a few things.  She's down there right now and just called.  She said the machines keep crashing when she tries to turn them on....she's about to try to get on the server and see what it does.

&amp;nbsp;

Me: **YOU KEEP KEVIN OFF THAT SERVER! I'M LEAVING NOW** (the thought of Kevin touching the server immediately put me into a panic)

&amp;nbsp;

after making record time to the office ...

Me: Okay Kevin, I need you to show me exactly what's happening

&amp;nbsp;

Kevin: (flustered) Okay, well I tried to turn on my computer and it gets halfway through the loading screen and then just turns off.  Then I tried another computer and it won't even turn on at all. See, watch.

&amp;nbsp;

Kevin walks to her computer, presses the power button, the machine starts to boot...I notice Kevin is still holding the power button...the machine turns back off.  Then Kevin walks to second computer, presses the power button, ""See, it won't even start to turn on...the screen is still black....what the hell is going on?""

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, realizing exactly what was going on, I reached Picard levels of facepalm.  I walk to the first computer, press the power button, release the power button, computer boots just fine.  Then I walk to the second machine and flip on the monitor.  Worked like a charm.

&amp;nbsp;

Kevin asked me to make up some elaborate story to tell my dad about how I fixed a major problem, but I thought the truth was better than any story I could have come up with.  Needless to say, almost a decade later and Kevin still hasn't heard the end of it.",talesfromtechsupport,691,1528389440
Universal_Binary,"The day the PFY graduated, but not before ""DAMN YOU, $BOSS"" echoed across the room","I was once $Boss, and from time to time I had PFYs (Pimply-Faced Youths, young/inexperienced in IT) reporting to me.  Sometimes I got to watch them grow so much in skill and confidence that they ceased to become a PFY almost right before my eyes.  But, in this case, not without one last hiccup.

To recap from my earlier story about this PFY ([Never squander a good outage](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8k4ad4/never_squander_a_good_outage_and_how_to_train_a/)):

/// cue flashback ///

&gt; I was constantly trying to drill into the PFYs:

&gt; 1) Check the simple things first.  EVERY simple thing.

&gt; 2) Question all assumptions.

&gt; 3) Don't give up

&gt; When a PFY got stuck and came to me for help, I would always ask about the simple stuff before giving other advice. (You've got to LIVE the rules to internalize them.)

&gt; At the beginning, this would result in many trips back to the equipment, to personally verify that it was plugged in, that the power cable was seated properly (on both ends!), that the network cable was plugged in, etc. This was always accompanied by a quantity of annoyed muttering.

&gt; As they got better, they would come to me saying, ""The box won't turn on, and I've checked both ends of the power cable, verified the outlet works, etc...""

/// back to the story... ///

So one day I had this conversation with a PFY:

&gt; Me: I need you to install Linux on this computer.  It'll ask you a few questions.  Here are the answers you'll need.

&gt; PFY: I've never used Linux.  I don't know anything about it.

&gt; Me: I know.  That's why I assigned the task to you.

&gt; PFY: Oh.  &lt;eye roll&gt; Great. &lt;/eye roll&gt;

PFY had been with the company for awhile by this point, and was getting to be good.  I knew he could handle it.

Off he went to the workbench in the lab.  It was in the opposite corner of our open-plan office from my desk.  He started off fine.  Then it started getting noisy.  I heard grunts.  Groans.  ""Dammit!""  And other visible signs of frustration.  But I left him alone.

And he didn't give up.  It was a personal thing with him now - he was determined to solve problems himself, without asking me for help.  He hated it when I solved a problem that he couldn't.  So he kept at it.  Googled, power cycled, everything.

Finally, after an entire hour and a half of frustration, he came over to me.

&gt; PFY: I just can't get this thing on the network.  And before you ask, I've checked everything.

&gt; Me: Any error messages?

&gt; PFY: Yes.  [ shows me ]

&gt; Me: That means the NIC doesn't see a network link.

&gt; PFY: I know.  But I made sure it's plugged in!

&gt; Me: Is the switch working?

(There was a little desktop switch underneath the workbench.)

&gt; PFY: Yeah, other machines on it are working.

&gt; Me: Then go back and double check the network cable to the PC.  Make sure it's plugged in tight on both ends.

&gt; PFY: I'm sure it's fine.  I've checked it at least 20 times!

&gt; Me: Just do it.

&gt; PFY: &lt;really annoyed&gt; FINE.  &lt;stomps off noisily&gt;

20 second later, echoing throughout the entire open-plan office, we hear, VERY loudly:

&gt; PFY: DAMN YOU, $BOSS!

Soft chuckles echo around the office...

He came over to my desk.

&gt; Me, unable to entirely suppress my grin: Oh, was the network cable unplugged?

&gt; PFY: Yes.  The network cable was unplugged.  AT THE SWITCH.

That was the very last time the PFY missed something obvious.  He went on to work for several tech companies, being a star tech at each, and recently getting a thoroughly-deserved promotion.

One day.... Oh yes, one day he will have PFYs.  On that day, I'm going to call him up and ask him to check his network cable.",talesfromtechsupport,3295,1528384182
Kabukikitsune,The toilet partition that took down an entire building's internet...,"Sub title:  Why did you put the server *there*? 

Okay, while I wasn't in tech support at the time, this was some what my fault; and since then it's left me wondering what the particular company was thinking...if at all.

Several years ago, my father and I ran a company where we installed toilet partitions in bathrooms.  It was a pretty high paying job (figure 5 to 10 grand per bathroom), with relatively easy work load. No more than three or four hours a day, if that. Depending on the number of bathrooms being installed, that is.

In this particular case, we had been called in to replace the partitions in every bathroom on the floor for this company.  They had recently been purchased, and that floor (previously unused) was being converted into a cube farm.  Since the floor hadn't been finished in the first place, we needed to add all the fixtures and partitions.  Due to various laws in place, we were limited in the type of hangers we could use, settling on something called ""full height"" brackets.  Basically an aluminum channel that goes the full height of the partition, and attaches at three or four places, as opposed to the usual small brackets and two attachment points.

In any case, after checking the building plans to make sure we weren't going to accidentally drill into anything dangerous, like power cables, or water lines for sprinkler systems, we set to work getting ready.  The first few bathrooms went fine, with us getting two or three done before we ran into problems.  

About halfway through the next install, one of the crew complained that he had 'hit' something with his drill.  That something had produced all manner of aluminum strips and scrap, making him think he'd hit a metal beam or something.  He hadn't been shocked, nor had water started spraying through the hole; so we told him to stop where he was while we sort out what happened.

We're consulting the plans, finding that there wasn't anything in that particular wall, when a rather harried fellow came running into the room.

&gt;Fellow:  What did you just do? You shut us down! Fix it, fix it now!

&gt;Me:  Wait...what?

&gt;Fellow:  We just went dark, and customers have business to do! This has to be your fault!

&gt;Me:  We're hanging partitions...so how is this *our* fault?

&gt;Fellow:  I don't know, it just is.

We immediately stopped work, and started investigating. It didn't take long to figure out what we'd hit.  Walking around outside the cube farm area, we discovered a locked door; complete with a rather interesting keypad entry.  Calling down to the building security, we informed them of the problem and asked what was behind the door.  After several minutes of searching, they informed us that it was the server farm for the company. 
Oh... great.

Eventually someone from IT popped up on the floor, and after much complaining and consideration, agreed to check the damage.  Guy returned about five minutes later to inform us that we'd hit a server.  So... yeah.  The guy had drilled through the wall, the back of the server, and right into one of the blades. (how the guy didn't get shocked is beyond me.)  This was likely to cost us dearly.

Thankfully we ended up being off the hook when it was revealed that there wasn't any interior drywall in the server room.  Literally it was just open support channels, and one sheet of plaster (drywall) hastily plunked on the outside to make it look secure.  No one ever expected someone to have to drill into it, and didn't consider the consequences of having the servers less than an inch from the newly hung drywall.

Company ended up losing quite a bit from that, I'm told, both from the less than secure nature of their server farm; and the damage caused.  It took us another month to finally finish the contract, after another construction crew had to be paid to actually secure and finish the server room.  

The company closed about a year later, having gone bankrupt.  Given how blasé they were about security...I can't say i'm surprised.

Mbx_Hntr,“Please stop scheduling things with users for me without telling me...”,"Obligatory this happened about twenty minutes ago. 

I’ve been working with this manager lady (officially name here on out) in my department for the last two years. Now, she’s not my boss, let’s clear that up first. She manages another department under Computer Services (CS), but still is managed by my manager (MANAGER). It’s confusing in practice, because this gives her the illusion of authority over the Help Desk staff. For two years, I let it slide.

Not today. This morning during our staff meeting, I make a joke that “I just quite smoking, so I’m going to be edgy for a few weeks. I’m apologizing now.” She should have taken that a little more seriously...

A few hours later, I’m neck deep in a project my MANAGER deemed “high priority. Anything else doesn’t matter”. I mention to him earlier that MANAGER LADY is going to want this other project done today ASAP, to which he replies “well than, she can do it. You can tell her that. Or you can ask an engineer  (ENGR) to look into it”.

Now I’m not going to bother an engineer with a DBA’s project (MANAGER LADies role in CS is primarily a DBA). That’s just silly, they’re actually busy, and she is not. 

I decide to take a break from my project and check the Support Ticket Queue. Not to my surprise, it has a ticket in there I haven’t seen post marked two hours prior. User needs help with new DB mapping’s. MANAGER LADY literally replied with “don’t worry, Mbx_Hntr will be by shortly to get you squared away!”

Oh. Hell. No. 

I promptly open up a new message in outlook, and CC an engineer friend for good measure... it went something like...

“MANAGER LADY,

Mbx_Hntr will NOT be by to check USERS issues today. I’m currently working on a project. I’ve scheduled this work for Friday pending issues tomorrow with my project. I’ve cc’ed ENGR so he’s in the loop. I’m hoping one of you can do it today. If else, Friday’s when I’m doing it. 

In the future, please do not schedule things with users for me. Especially if you don’t tell me, because I didn’t know about this one. Glad I caught it before the user realized I’m not coming over...”

So I waited a moment. A second later my EGNR replied “anything I can do to help, I’m good”. He’s new, still very eager; poor bastard. 

MANAGER LADY replied “that’s okay, I checked with MANAGER, and I’m just going to take care of it...”

OH SO YOU SENT MY COMPLAINT TO OUR MANAGER, WHO ALSO TOLD YOU TO FUCK OFF?!? GOOD. 

There is NEVER a reason to make promises for other people, especially when the user base cries when their mouse batteries die... 

So as I’m sitting at my desk working, I see her and our manager walking off to go have a meeting on what I only assume is to discuss her behavior in pretending like she’s my boss. Fucking. Good. 

If that’s doesn’t resolve this issue, I’m not sure what else will.

Selben,Completely Encrypted,"**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

$Selben: Me! Tier 2 help-desk technician for a mid-sized company, with a very skeleton-crew help-desk. 10 of us total providing 24-hour coverage (not including supervisors) for 2500+ people company-wide.

 

$HRDrone: Random HR person.

 

$HRLead: The HR ~~Hivemind~~ manager.

 

$Sup1: Previously in sales. No IT background and causes more issues than he solves.

 

$Sup2: All around great supervisor. Worked his way up from the support line and understands how the helpdesk works. Being the night-shift manager makes communication with all shifts difficult.

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

$Selben muted the customer and yawned. It was the last day before a holiday weekend and had been a long shift. Despite only three calls and two emails for the entire day, none of the techs were allowed to leave early, just in case an important issue arose. $Sup1 was pacing around the office and in a particularly bad mood since he had been given the responsibility of locking up the building when the techs all left.

 

&gt; $Selben: Okay… Now reboot.

 

&gt; $User: It won’t reboot!

 

&gt; $Selben: Click reboot.

 

&gt; $User: Oh, its rebooting now! Is it done?!

 

&gt; $Selben: Let’s wait for it to reboot…

 

$Selben finished all his notes for the ticket, then stared down at the time, waiting for it to magically speed up, while occasionally responding to the customer with the occasional ‘Yep, just wait! And what do you see now?’.

 

&gt; $User: It’s working now!

 

&gt; $Selben: Great, have a wonderful weekend!

 

&gt; $User: Okay, bye!

 

$Selben then along with all the other techs returned to staring at the empty call queue

 

With two hours remaining, $Selben watched as a couple other techs finished their shifts, nodding in solidarity as they headed out. Another hour passed with no calls or emails, $Selben sat quietly. $Sup1 was on his cell chatting with someone, looking a bit more cheerful as the day was finally coming to an end. Once $Selben was off his shift, $Sup1 could also leave - from what he overheard $Selben concluded $Sup1 had a date. With ten minutes left, naturally $Selben’s phone began to ring, he could practically feel the dagger like eyes from $Sup1 across the room.

 

&gt; $Selben: Thank you for calling, this is $Selben.

 

A panicked voice came from the other side.

 

&gt; $HRDrone: This is $HRDrone from HR!

 

&gt; $Selben: Okay.

 

&gt; $HRDrone: I need to take care of something urgently! But you can’t look at it, because the information is confidential! I need this file completely encrypted!

 

&gt; $Selben: Okay, no problem! That should only take a couple minutes.

 

$Sup1 stood next to $Selben’s desk, pointing at his watch. $Selben muted the call briefly and explained it was someone from HR. $Sup1 threw his hands in the air and stomped back to his office.

$Selben was eventually able to get $HRDrone to give up some of the “classified information.” It was something that had to do with a legal issue, so to be emailed around it needed to be encrypted. Simple enough. $Selben offered to connect in and show how to use the software they normally use. However, $HRDrone refused to let him connect in case he tried to look at the files. (*Sigh*) After two and a half hours, $Selben was finally able to walk $HRDrone through installing the software and encrypting the file. $HRDrone seemed happy about the success and finally the call ended.

 

No sooner had the receiver hung up, $Sup1 was practically pulling $Selben out of his chair and pushing him out the door. Besides the minor delay, $Selben had a good holiday weekend. The whole company was off, and the IT Department was included - three worry-free days of bliss.

 

Naturally upon returning to work Tuesday morning, $Selben was ~~ambushed then captured~~ greeted and taken to a side office by some HR ~~minions~~ employees. $HRDrone, $Sup2, and the head of HR were already waiting. Everyone was very upset, so $Selben sat and patiently waited to be fired for something he had (or hadn’t) done. After the long weekend it’s sometimes tough bounce back into things without coffee.

 

&gt; $HRLead: I need to know why things were handled *this* way.

 

&gt; $Sup2: Please explain to us what the problem is.

 

&gt; $HRDrone: HE! (*points at $Selben*) took forever to encrypt my files and then it didn’t even work. I’m betting is was because he was in a rush to leave on Friday. This is poor customer service!

 

&gt; $Sup2: $Selben is more than capable of running the encryption software. I doubt he just didn’t do it.

 

&gt; $Selben: Ah, well, I was told to not connect to the machine, so I spent two and a half hours walking $HRDrone through the process.

 

$Sup2 raised an eyebrow.

 

&gt; $HRLead: Why wouldn’t you let him connect? He’s part of IT.

 

&gt; $HRDrone: It’s part of *The Files*

 

&gt; $HRLead: You mean *The Files*?! Of course they can’t see them!

 

$Selben refrained from letting his eyes roll into the back of his head.

 

&gt; $Sup2: Okay, let’s just fix this - can we look at the file?

 

After much convincing that seeing a filename wouldn’t let IT know the contents of *The File*, they got $HRDrone to show *The File*. As $Selben expected, it was encrypted, and no issue could be seen by him or $Sup2.

 

&gt; $Sup2: So, what’s the…

 

$HRDrone interrupted, holding up a hand with a smug look. He opened an email, dated before the call to $Selben on Friday, where the file had been shared with him from $HRLead, and opened it.

 

&gt; $HRDrone: See, it’s not encrypted at all! Also, watch this.

 

$HRDrone pulled out a thumb drive. $Selben bit his lip after making the realization of what was about to happen. $HRDrone put the drive into his machine and was able to open the file stored on it without decrypting it as well.

 

$Sup2 and $Selben glanced over at $HRLead, who had gone quiet. His jaw was actually dropped. $Selben was impressed at how closely $HRLead suddenly resembled a cartoon character.

 

&gt; $Sup2: Okay, I’ve seen enough. $HRLead, we will schedule some training for your staff on how encryption works in the next week.

 

&gt; $HRLead: Agreed.

 

As a recap, $HRDrone thought once you encrypted a file that ALL copies of the file in any location would also be encrypted. All HR reps were scheduled to go through a mandatory training over the next month on how to use the encryption software and expectations of how it should function.",talesfromtechsupport,1206,1528299731
crapengineer,"Press ctrl-D, like I asked.","I once drove for 3 hours through heavy holiday traffic to type ctrl\-D to get a server to boot. On arrival there was nowhere to park except the directors spot. The job was very urgent according to the customer so I parked up in his spot and carried on into the building.

5 minutes later stood in front of the server and looking at the server terminal there was no output. Customer was yabbering on to one of his colleagues and not paying any attention. I held down ctrl\-D on the terminal and cycled the terminal power.  Bingo , two seconds later the server is booting. ""What did you do"" shouts the customer when he noticed the server coming back to life. Pressed ctrl\-D and power cycled the terminal like I asked you to do over the phone.

joosier,But my employee starts today!!,"
I got a status request for a purchase order in my queue this morning.

I looked it up and it was for a high end workstation that we have to build to spec with parts we don't have on hand. 

The order was place on Friday, June 01st.  Today is Monday, June 4th. 
The order status is ""Order placed with vendor - awaiting parts.""

I called the customer back and let them know the status of the ticket. 

As per the title, the customer let me know that this HAD to be completed within the hour if not today because his employee started today!

Standard procedure for a new employee is to submit their needed equipment at least 30 days for standard equipment, longer for special order equipment.    I referred customer to those requirements but got the usual laundry list of desperate refusals to accept reality (in no particular order): 

1) Passive aggressive threat about the financial cost of the employee's idle time being blamed on IT. 

2) Rhetorical (from my point anyway) questions about how the new employee with spend their time now? 

3) Demands for the tracking numbers for the parts so they can track the shipping themselves. (We don't even have those yet)

4) Ad hoc employee evaluations (very negative) for my entire department and eventually myself. 

5) Dire apocalyptic prophesy about the impact on the company if not the world or human life in general  if their employee does not get their system in a few hours (bit my tongue to keep from suggesting we send a tech to re-image the customer's similar system to the new employee to avoid this Extinction Level Event)

5) Demands to talk to a manager (No managers were in yet so I sent my manager an urgent email requesting they call the customer ASAP.  I CC'ed the customer as requested AND I even went the extra mile to CC the customer's manager along with a quick explanation of the situation.)

ITSupportZombie,"A shouting mob, tears and a wookie roar.","Last year, we migrated to Windows 10.

It did not go well.

About half way through my migration schedule, I had to do an office of old ladies that were very resistant to change in all ways. They were in an uproar when the menu at their favorite lunch spot was updated. All new computers and a new operating system would be extra fun for me.

Side Note: My coworker and I listed out all the problem offices/users and divided them up so we both got an equal amount of problem users.

On the day the migration was scheduled, I showed up to their office at the scheduled time. They were of course not ready for me. No backups done, matter of fact they were still working as if nothing was going on. They received no less than 5 general emails and each received a calendar invite with clear instructions, and the date and time of the migration. They chose to \(unsurprisingly\) ignore them.

\&gt;When I showed up to do the migration I was ganged up on and told what a terrible person I am for changing things on them.

\&gt;How dare I disrupt their important work with this? 

\&gt;Can’t they have an exception? 

\&gt;We are still getting used to Windows 7!

\&gt;Come back later, we are busy!

\&gt;You don’t have my permission to touch my computer!

I politely explain to them that this was put out in multiple meetings, by email and the flashing reminders that just popped up on their screens reminding them that this was happening. I politely ask them to pull up the email from the CEO stating that this is mandatory and all exceptions will have to be submitted in writing 2 weeks ago. I explain that I am doing my job and if they refuse this migration, I will lock their computers out until the migration has been completed.

They continue to refuse to allow me access to their computers.

At this point I am tired of going in circles with them and calmly walk of the office and return to mine. Once at my desk, I lock their computers in AD and send a remote restart. Their computers are now locked out. Within 5 minutes, they all storm into my office hurling insults, accusations and one is begging me to give her an exception. I repeat my speech about this being mandatory and I do not have the power to exempt anyone, even the scheduling of this was out of my hands.

Once again tired of going in circles with them, I call the CEO directly. He backs my actions and orders them to allow me access.

I return to their office to perform the migration. Taking the CEO’s suggestion, I recommend the ladies go take a coffee break and come back in 30 minutes. I back up the user data, swap the computers with new hardware and restore their profiles to the new computers. Task complete!

It wasn’t.

For anyone who reads these stories, we all know this isn’t where it ends.

About the time that the ladies were finished taking their hour long 30 minute break, it is time for lunch. I make a point of taking a full hour away from my desk each day at a set time whenever possible. I sit on a bench outside, reading a book. I find this helps me recenter myself. My users \(generally\) know that I am to be left alone during this time. I become surly when I do not have my midday break. 

The ladies weren’t having it. About 15 minutes into my lunch, they all came storming out to where I sit, foaming at the mouth and hurling abuse even before they were close enough for me to understand them. When the mob finally gets to my bench, I remind them I am on lunch and would be back in my office in 45 minutes.

\&gt;How dare I take a lunch break when they are having computer issues!

I know that they will continue to mob me until I relent. Normally, I do not allow my lunch to be interrupted, but I know this will only be made worse if I do not go now. We proceed to their office and I ask what the issue is. Immediately I am overwhelmed by the most basic of issues.

\&gt;What is my password?

\&gt;How do I log in?

\&gt;Where is all my apps?

\&gt;Give me back my old computer!

Three of the four ladies are yelling at me, the fourth is sobbing quietly at her desk. She tells me that this is all too much change and maybe she should just retire. I know what needs to be done.

I give the loudest Wookie roar I can \(my throat was sore for a bit after\) to get their attention. The yelling stops, the room is silent but for some muffled sobs and all eyes are on me \(including some from people in other offices now\). 

I spend the next two hours training them on how to navigate Win10 and made four new friends for life. These four old ladies were some of my best customers from that point on because I took the time to educate them and make sure they knew what to do.",talesfromtechsupport,856,1528099974

&gt;$me: huh, that's odd, maybe it's the power to your desks.

Our office is in a startup incubator, so the office is managed by another company. I wander over and collar $OM, then go back to where $MLH sits.

&gt;$MLH: I'm working from my laptop because it's impossible to use my desktop. $MLC1, your screen has been going off too, right?
&gt;$MLC1: yeah, at exactly the same time
&gt;$me: okay, I'm assuming the floor box, $MLC2 has yours gone off too?
&gt;$MLC2: nope, it's been fine.

I look at how the desks are arranged. The floor boxes are right at the front edges of the desks, almost where the chairs would be. There's a single cable going through the cover. $MLH opens the lid while $OM and I watch.

&gt;$MLH: I don't think that...

He presses down on the plug. It seats more firmly into the socket.

Yesterday morning, 9 am, I got a call from a co-worker based at several hundred kilometers from my office. Here what happened :

$me will be me, $her will be her, to keep it simple.
I appreciate her and she's not completely clueless... Usually.

&gt;$her : Hey $me ! My laptop isn't working this morning, I can't turn it on, I don't understand why... Can you help ?

&gt;$me : Yeah sure, we'll go through the basics : have you plugged it, tried a different outlet ? Is there any light or sound, maybe vibration coming from it ?

&gt;$her : No, absolutely nothing. It was working fine yesterday in the office, but I couldn't use it at home, I don't know what happened

&gt;$me : You took it at home ? You're not really supposed to do that, it should stay on your desk...

&gt;$her : Yeah I know, but I had to for personal reasons, sorry about that... And do you think it would be possible to get a bag for the laptop ? I'm getting tired to keep it under my arm when moving around with it

&gt;$me : What do you mean keep it under your arm ?

&gt;$her : Well, I had to hold it from the office to my home.

From there, I'm reminding myself that tuesday, there was some really bad weather, a lot of rain, which flooded the street, to give you an idea of the intensity. And I fear of what her answer might be when I ask her if she took it under the rain...

&gt;$her : Well, yeah, I had to, I don't have any bag for it

&gt;$me : And... The laptop got wet, right ?

&gt;$her : Yeah... But I dried it and wrapped it in a towel when I was back home

I had to really hold my sigh on the phone, and told her that since the computer was rained on, it was probably 74dead. She didn't seem to make any connection between the fact that her computer died and the fact that she put it under the rain...
But, well, my manager agreed to give her a brand new laptop, under the condition that it will not, never, ever, leave the office.",talesfromtechsupport,2959,1527764834
necrosxiaoban,Dueling Dual Monitors,"The following tale is set in a small, East Coast office environment wherein I am often called to provide on-site tech support when our corporate tech support (West Coast) is unavailable or needs a pair of eyeballs on the problem. Lately, I've had issues where our new hires feel they need not just two, but even three or four monitors. All requests for additional monitors have been denied. 

The cast is as follows:

**$Me**: Yours truly.
**$CSL**: Our delightfully competent Customer Service Leader.
**$NewGirl**: A recent hire who defies explanation. The office pool is currently giving her till Friday before she gets the boot. Incompetence given human form.

Our tale begins in the early hours of the morning as I'm leaving my house for the office. $CSL calls me because $NewGirl's computer isn't working, and wants to know when I'll be there to fix it. Since it will be at least 30 minutes before I get there, and $NewGirl can't work without a functional computer, I try to begin diagnosing the problem over the phone.

$CSL tells me $NewGirl's monitors aren't working, both were only giving a blank screen, so I began running through general troubleshooting; are the monitors on, cables connected, yada yada, but nothing's working. I'm at a loss for what the problem could be, but we've had bad weather lately and consider a power surge may have knocked a monitor out. 

I start walking $CSL through getting a replacement monitor out of the storage room, when she helpfully volunteers they can only see the cursor on the screen. ""Wait, what?! I thought they were blank."" Well, yeah, $CSL replies, they're blank except for the cursor. 

Okaaaaay.... so we're not dealing with dead monitors. ""Well, did you try turning it off and on again?"" Yes, $CSL replies before offering to check the cables again. ""No, please don't, I think we're dealing with a software issue here.""

So I have them reboot into safe mode, which works, then into normal mode, which also works, so problem solved. Great.


Later in the day I'm in the office when $NewGirl pops in to say she's having the same issue again. I walk over and find two black screens with only the cursor visible. No amount of clicking, Ctrl+Alt+Del'ing or Ctrl+Shift+Esc'ing produces any result, so I reboot a few times, each time it works, but then suddenly cuts out again.

Well, darn. Maybe there is an intermittent hardware fault here. I go to check the cables again, when to my surprise I find 2 VGA cables and 1 DVI cable plugged into the back of the PC. That can't be right, there's only 2 monitors. Also, one of the VGA ports goes to the onboard card, and one goes to the external card. You can't use both simultaneously.

""Why are there three cables?"" I ask aloud. No one answers.

I disconnect the VGA attached to the onboard card and voila! it works! Happy to have it working, but still confused where the extra cable came from I begin tugging on it to pull it out from behind the desk since its no certainly not needed. Strangely, it seems to be attached to something?!

Tracing the cable I find it plugged into one of the two monitors, right alongside the DVI cable. ""Who ran two cables to the same monitor?"" I ask aloud. 

""I did"", $NewGirl replies. 

""Buy why?"", I inquire increduously.

""I saw there were 2 ports so I wanted to enable dual monitors on that one"".

I glared back at $NewGirl as if to say, ""It does not work that way. Why are you messing with your PC? Why aren't you focusing on the tasks you've been assigned which you cannot handle? Why are you here? How do you function as an adult human being?"". Of course, all of that is left unsaid. 

After a long silence I finally tell her, ""Okay, well, for future reference attaching a second cable does not turn one monitor into two.""

Oh how I can't wait for $NewGirl's boss to come back from her vacation. ",talesfromtechsupport,1146,1527706712

I work as a Level 1 and 2 technical support engineer for $company providing phone support for what is essentially glorified printers.

Once a month these lovely machines have to connect to our servers to provide usage stats, and while most connect using DSL/Fiber/whatever-internet quite a few machines still connect using analogue phonelines and a modem.

&gt;**$c** Hi this is $C with $customercompany, my machine won't upload data.

So i get her information and start checking on my end.  
I can't see any connections that made it in to our infrastructure, but i can see that the last connecting was made using a modem

We go through the usual steps of powering off the machine, unplugging the phone line. etc...

&gt;**$me** I am sorry ma'am but it would appear that the issue lies with $phonecompany, what i can see indicates some jitter on the phone line.

&gt;**$c** Well what are you going to do to fix it?  we pay you for this machine and this is very unprofessional!

&gt;**$me** We have some digital solutions available that will allow you to connect this machine to your internet so you can stop paying for a phone line just for this purpose

&gt;**$c** WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING NEW YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE THIS WORK RIGHT NOW!!!

&gt;**$me** As stated earlier, the issue appears to be with $phonecompany so you will have to call their support instead.

&gt;**$c** Are you going to compensate me for the time i have wasted making YOUR equipment work?!?

&gt;**$me** I can put you in touch with sales, they can provide you with a very competitive price for a digital solution, otherwise you will have to call $phonecompany

I was visiting the home of an old client  trying to drum up some business from him \(I hand delivered a quote for a new server\).

His son approached me and asked if I had a spare USB lead in my car. It seems he was installing a small laser printer for his dad and it was not going well. 

The lad was around 14 and had  almost done it correctly. He had set the printer up, and run the install disk to  setup the driver on  the pc,  but it wouldn't  connect with the wireless network and he thought that he would have to use a USB lead to program the printer, and naturally there wasn't one in the house.

I winked at his father then held my hands up and said

""I am Mountain Wombat. A great and powerful  network  wizard!  TALK!!""

I placed one hand on the printer and the other on the  router and after about 15 seconds  the setup software reported that the printer had connecter to the network.

The boy looked down t the printer, then up at me looking confused and a little in awe.

Both his father and I  tried to keep a straight face but we both started laughing. After a minute or two I showed him the CONNECT button on the printer and the WPS button on the router.

I used to work for a B2B Internet Service Provider as my first real job, way back in the beginning of this decade. No longer a lowly L1 Helpdesk, I worked at the $ISP’s Systems Integrator division (Not sure how common this is in other countries, but here, almost all large ISPs have their own Systems Integrator division, some even has Cisco’s Gold Partner certification.) as a pre-sales engineer.

Below that, I saw some back-and-forth email between $Salesperson and $CustomerIT. As a background, $Customer is a household brand that you will see at least a few times a day. Apparently, they were deploying a new application for internal use, and was looking to purchase some servers. 

Fair enough, I don’t normally work with server opportunities since I’m more of a network guy, but this doesn’t seem to be that complicated. So I called $Salesperson on her cell.

The requirement itself was pretty big for the time but wasn’t really crazy either. Three servers, dual socket Xeons, lots of RAM, a couple of spinning disks. I was a bit worried about delivery time, but I fired an email to the usual suspects (Dell, HP, IBM) for a quote. 

A couple of days later, I sent the three quotes to $Salesperson to give $Customer a couple of options and proceeded to move on with my life.

&amp;nbsp;

A few weeks later, I was about to make a cup of tea when I realized my stash is empty. This cannot be a good sign.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;From: $Manager

&gt;To: $Me

&gt;Cc: $DivManager, $SalesDirector

&gt;Hi $Me,

&gt;You worked on $Customer’s opportunity a while ago, correct? We received quite a lively complaint from $CustManager about the server we provided. Could you tell us what exactly happened on your side?

&gt;Cheers,

&gt;$Manager`

&amp;nbsp;

I highly respect $Manager for a lot of things, but his calmness under pressure and his penchant for understatement are definitely somewhere on top. While he said ‘lively complaint’ what truly happened in the email thread preceding it is closer to ‘on-chair bowel evacuation’ for $SalesDirector 

Apparently we had sent $Customer -who is now just few days away from deadline-  a server with the wrong specification. $CustManager even sent us screenshots of the servers’ specification. All of them are woefully below what I remember was required. Hell, I’m sure my gaming PC back then was faster than any of those three. I felt my stomach turning. But after I checked my email history and submitted BoQs, I was reasonably sure I was in the clear. After a few more rechecks, I braved myself to reply. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;From: $Manager

&gt;To: $Me

&gt;Cc: $DivManager; $SalesDirector; $Salesperson

&gt;Dear $Manager,

&gt;I did work on that opportunity. I think something is wrong, though. The specification screenshots $CustManager sent us is very different from what I sent to $Salesperson (I attached vendor quotes, my quote, and all relevant email)

&gt;Thanks,

&gt;$Me

&amp;nbsp;

Not long after that, a little ray of hope appeared. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;From:$Salesperson

&gt;To: $Me; $Manager

&gt;Cc: $DivManager; $SalesDirector; $Salesperson

&gt;Dear $Manager, $Me,

&gt;Something is *very* wrong. I actually don’t remember receiving any PO for those servers. I’ll be conferencing $CustomerIT in a moment, can you guys join?

&gt;Thanks,

&gt;$Salesperson

&amp;nbsp;

Huh. 

&amp;nbsp;

‘Huh’ was my exact reaction reading this email, I remember this vividly because a few desks away, $Manager made the exact same sound before calling me to join him and $Salesperson.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;$Salesperson: Hi $CustomerIT, I have $Me and $Manager in this call.

&gt;$CustomerIT: Hi guys, I understand my boss was a bit… 

&gt;$Manager: I’d say ‘animated’

&gt;$CustomerIT: … animated earlier today, sorry about that. That’s because we need to present the application to C-Level next week.

&gt;$Manager: Don’t worry about that, $SalesDirector took most of the brunt. I need to ask though, did *__we__* even provide those servers?

&gt;$Salesperson: Yea, I don’t remember receiving any PO for them 

&gt;$CustomerIT: You guys didn’t. Our new procurement, bless his noble intentions, decided to shop around for a price comparison. What he should do was confirm with me before issuing PO, guess what he did. 

&gt;$Me: Buy from whoever bid lowest?

&gt;$CustomerIT: That he did. If they provided the same specification we won’t be having this conversation. 

&gt;$Me: Ouch, what’s your plan for the deadline , then?

&gt;$CustomerIT: Honestly not too sure. We have the application running temporarily on a spare PC we have, but once users start testing I don’t think it will hold. I can’t use any other servers for various reasons. We’re definitely preparing to purchase your original quotation, though. 

&gt;$Me: Yeah, that thing will melt. Say, do you really need all three servers to run it? 

&gt;$CustomerIT: Two for application redundancy, one for DB, yeah.

&gt;$Me: Can you pull the CPU and RAM from one server and put it in the other server?

&gt;$CustomerIT: Yeah, but won’t it mess with the warranty?

&gt;$Me: Honestly not sure.

&gt;$Manager: We can’t officially recommend it, but I think that’s a valid solution. Better if you can add some more RAM. I’ll check if we have some spare laying around

&gt;$CustomerIT: I’ll try that. I’ll contact you guys later.

&amp;nbsp;

The servers we quoted originally have two CPUs (eight cores total) and 64GB RAM each. $CustomerIT managed to convince $AppVendor to try and install it on a server with four core CPU and 8GB RAM. That server managed to heroically last through user testing phase (with some noted performance complaints) while we scrambled to prepare the replacements. 

It was a mistake from $Customer’s procurement that cost them maybe an extra $3000-4000 on top of our ~$20000 quote (plus whatever it was to expedite delivery), though still only a drop in the bucket compared to what $Application cost them. 

What amused me the most was $CustManager's sheepish expression when we met with him after that fiasco. Now that's entertainment.

Suurikarhu,The case of the (not so) missing monitor.,"Hello i'm your standard FTP LTL also dutch and beginning reditor so forgive any spelling / formatting mistakes.    
    
This story happened today and is one of the funnier cases I've had since starting my internship.    
So I work for a small company \(30\-60 employees\) that has its business in resale.  
The day is going fairly normally with the usual amount of e\-mail requests when I spot this gem.  


Subject: Monitor missing, urgent need for replacement.  
The e\-mail basically describes that our Customer Service manager noticed one of the monitors was missing \(Stolen? Borrowed?\). Now recently I installed a new monitor for a client that actually had it's monitor borrowed so I figured someone must've taken it again.  


Queue me walking over to Customer Service with no higher priority requests to investigate.  
I walk in to their office and do a quick count ... 8 clients, 16 monitors all appears to be in order but just to make sure I call her over and ask which monitor is missing. She immediately points to a client with 2 monitors and stutters   
""I\-i\-it wasnt there this morning when I walked in ... I must be tired"".  


Easiest request of the day and I got a nice chuckle out of it.

Fearme4life,"Uh, well if you're going to cut it I can't stop you.","I think this is the first time I am ever posting here and I read the rules and I think this could go here. However if I am an idiot I apologize and feel free to delete all my hard work!

So I am a contracted cable technician for a large very hated isp. I receive a work order labeled ""Special Request Order"" that is outside only and this job states that there is an above ground temporary cable and I should fill out a survey so the line can be dug underground.

Now how this usually works is there is an app that when I am onsite at the job and open the app it automatically fills out all the customer information with the job details and I just submit pictures and answer a couple of yes/no questions (Do we need to go across a driveway or need neighbor access stuff like that).

So I show up at 5:40pm (I am scheduled to work until 5pm but they gave me this job at 4:55 because it was a no time frame job) and I am SHOCKED at what I find. So there is a white cable coming from our box across the driveway of the house I was here to do the job for, but it did not go to that house. It went past the driveway, past the house, past the yard, past the neighbor's driveway to the side of the neighbor's house.

Due to the way the survey system works I can not submit a survey for his neighbor because I do not have a job for his neighbor. I go and knock on my job address's door and an old slightly overweight man comes to the door. I give him my greetings and explain the situation to him. He becomes incredibly irate because someone ran this line without his permission and its going across his property. He tells me the line needs to be removed NOW.

I call up my supervisor to explain what is going on and my supervisor tells me I can not cut the line because it could be providing phone service to his neighbor and if he needs emergency help his phone needs to be working. Customer overhears and says his neighbor is not home and he does not care and if I wont cut it then he will do it himself.  Since its his property I can not stop him so I have to wish him a good day and I pull away and see him coming out with a pair of shears.

Some notes: I am on mobile writing this on the way home so please excuse any grammatical or spelling errors. Also we are usually not allowed to run lines across other people's property without their consent. It seems a different isp was installing their lines and cut up a bunch of underground lines and the temporary line was ran due to this.",talesfromtechsupport,1574,1527458710
SuperSecretSpare,"""Don't order any upgraded equipment!""","About a year ago I was in charge of gathering required specs for computer needs and putting in an order for about 500 PCs, monitors, keyboards, mice, etc. for a new office building that was opening that my company manages. Being that I had already done this same quote for multiple buildings, I knew exactly what was needed. The standard PC build from our vendor comes with 4 gb ram. To run specific software, I have to include at minimum 8 gb, otherwise the computer all but stops working. When making the build through our vendor the additional 4 gb of ram only runs us an extra $26. I put the quote together and sent it off to our budgeting department for final approval and ordering. Within the hour I received the following emails from the head of budgeting.

Him: I see you included an extra charge of $26x500 for computer memory?

Me: Yup. We need it to run X software.

Him: Will it run without the extra memory?

Me: Not well

Him: We are already over budget. Don't order any upgraded equipment! Just get the basic stuff.

After trying to explain why it was important several times, why the software won't run...

Me (not in the mood to deal with his crap anymore): Sure thing. I will get that quote for you right away.

So I revised the order without the memory and sent it back to him. A few weeks later, the computers get delivered and are set up in the new offices. I get them all imaged with the software over the weekend and ready to go. First thing Monday morning I come in to a frantic slew of emails about how the specialized software won't run and nobody can do their job. After a few back-and-forth emails with the COO I sent the full email chain with jackass explaining what happened. I am told to immediately put in an order for the extra memory, have it delivered as soon as possible, and get it installed immediately.

By ordering the memory separately instead of installed initially at $26 per we had to pay an extra $50,000 ($128 per memory stick because we have a horrible non-compete vendor). Not only that, but I got a ton of overtime and the company lost out on a weeks worth of productivity. All in all, the company probably lost close to $200,000 if not more.

He didn't get fired, but he now has his own policy of ordering what the IT guy suggests, no questions asked.",talesfromtechsupport,2748,1527400693
TerrifiedRedneck,It's Installed Where?,"A year or so ago, I got free and clear from a job in a local educational establishment that, for want of a better term was ""Hell on Earth"".  

I've got a decade worth of stories that now I am log gone from there I can start to share.  Everything from completely illogical power supply switch installations to many and varied staff requesting bizarre things becasue they think ""IT Staff"" translates to ""Wizard who can fix everything from the coffee machine to the Vacuum cleaner""!!  

This particular story is from around 7 year ago \(I know, an actual eternity in IT terms\) and features one of the most heroic attempts at accidentally breaking something I had ever seen.

Our cast:

&gt;**$ME** A lowly level 1 tech at the time \- plenty of experience and knowledge but hamstrung buy the IT Manager's need to make himself indispensable.    
&gt;  
&gt;**$FT** A friendly computer studies teacher who was lovely to talk to but impossible to deal with once out of her comfort zone.    
&gt;  
&gt;**$TAP** Our lovely new apprentice  
&gt;  
&gt;**$ITM** The IT Manager

The setup:

&gt;For... let's just say reasons... when we received a request a year or so previous to this story happening to allow students access to Ruby, the decision was made to give students a small VM to run the software on.  **$ITM** was the only person that ever knew the correct combination of duct tape and WD\-40 used to keep it working and never let us techs even look over his shoulder when fixing things just in case.    
&gt;  
&gt;Now,  **$ITM** is on annual leave and we get the call...

**$ME** Hello, IT. TerrifiedRedneck speaking.

**$FT** Please come up to $Class ASAP. I planned a lesson with $Ruby and it worked fine last week. Today it doesn't work!

**$ME** \(*kinda thinking ""yeah, right, last week, whatever""*\) No worries. Is it on all the computers, some, or just yours?

**$FT** All the PCs. I've had students move and everything and it still isn't working. Please Help!

Admittedly, at this point I panicked. This software and it's setup is completely alien to me and I don't want to let the teacher or her class down.  **$ITM** always said that if there was an issue I could ring or text him. But my stubbornness and want of his job at some point always stopped me from doing that.

I was considering it here though.  

I grab **$TAP** and we head to the top floor of a five storey building \- We were across the campus, not even in the same building.  

Sure enough, we get in to the classroom and **$FT** is in full headless chicken mode.

**$FT** I don't know what's going on, I talked to **$ITM** last week and it as fine

*$ME S\*\*\* S\*\*\* S\*\*\* S\*\*\**

**$ME** Ok, lets see if the problem is immediately fixable. 

Meanwhile I get **$TAP** to login as himself \(all IT Tech accounts were DA's at this point. I know, I know, as soon as I could, It wasn't a thing anymore\). Nope, he can't make it work either.  

**$ME** Right, yeah, something here isn't right. 

Through a series of clever pulleys and levers, I RDP onto my office machine so I can troubleshoot in the room without being hindered by the lack of tools on the machines.  It occurs to me, i know so little about this installation, I don't even know where it's installed.  Right... Let's take a butcher's.

&gt;\\\\$ITMPC\\c$\\software\\ruby

I kid you not.

I send **$TAP** back to the office to switch on his machine. Low and behold, I get a call five minutes later and things start to come to life. I could not believe it.  

**$FT** was suitably impressed, **$TAP** got the credit \(he did fix it after all\) and I magically solved the issues of the broken Ruby installation, the broken license server for some music software that was broken for the same reason \(but no one spotted or reported it yet\) AND why **$ITM**'s PC would randomly slow to a speed similar to pensioners humping all while he was on holiday!  

TL:DR \- turning off the computer you install stuff on without telling anyone stops things working",talesfromtechsupport,907,1527327881
TheLightningCount1,Yes. Lava would definitely be the cause of your issue and you should probably evacuate. No I am not kidding. You need to evacuate now.,"Got a call early this morning from someone who showed up extremely early at their branch. They were looking to log into the system and add 2-3 files onto the loan they were writing. 

&gt; $HC = Hawaiian User 

&gt; $ME = Saul Tigh

&gt; $ME - Thanks for calling the help desk. 

&gt; $HC - Yeah my internet doesnt work at my office this morning. Its really early and I need to file these w2s for the underwriters. 

&gt; $ME - OK run me through what you have done so far and I will know where to start from there. 

&gt; $HC - Well... I uh... I called you?

&gt; $ME - *Laughs* Ok lets head to your network room and just unplug everything, wait about 30 seconds and plug it back in. 

*10 minutes later*

&gt; $HC - Yeah its still only showing 1 green light. 

&gt; $ME - Yeah will need to put in a ticket with your local ISP. Give me your address please. 
 
She gives me her address and I look it up. 

&gt; $ME - Umm. Thats in Hawaii. UMM BRO Thats on the island of Hawai'i. The one with the volcano. 

&gt; $HC - Yeah I know. You think that has anything to do with it?

&gt; $Me - Yeah I think lava definitely would definitely be the cause of your internet issues. Are you in the path of the ash cloud?

&gt; $HC - Doubt it. 

&gt; $Me - Yeah you should probably evacuate. You cant do anything from where you are anyways as the volcano has cut off your internet. (Legitimately my favorite sentence I have ever said.) If not evacuate, get everyone you know, and your dog, ready to evacuate. 

She laughed a bit and sighed. 

&gt; $HC - You really think its that dangerous?

&gt; $ME - Umm yes. Then again I am not there and can not make a judgement call for you. That being said, I highly doubt that your isp will be able to service this until the volcano goes dormant again. Recommend working from home being ready to evacuate. Would also letting everyone else in your office know that your office is closed for the time being. But that is just my suggestion. 

&gt; $HC - So nothing you could do on your end to fix it?

&gt; $ME - Unfortunately I do not have those kinds of abilities. Yet. ",talesfromtechsupport,2840,1527266037
ITOverlord,"No! We dinosaurs use STONE tablets, thank you.","Hey all, back again with a fun one. This happened yesterday, and its slow this morning so may as well throw this up. 

As usual, quick background, I work for a company that handles IT for most offices in a single industry. There is sometimes data sensitive enough for there to be legal enforcement of it, so we are veeery careful on how we do our network and server setups. We have standardized equipment, IP schemes, naming processes etc. Very very meticulous and enforced for good reason. We have multiple levels of techs with varying skills (ranging from basic entry level IT work, to handling 20+ offices for a single company and having personal knowledge of terminal servers and etc. for those specific offices). My role mostly involves managing our internal portal, creating programs and utilities for employees/management, and being tagged in when something is juuust below 'Level 3' clearance to make sure it really needs to hit that high. With all that in place lets begin!



So the day starts as usual, roll into the office, stare longingly at the coffee bar, wondering once again why I quit that sweet sweet caffeine, before sighing and taking my place at my desk. Things are going well, we are nearing a holiday weekend so it's pretty slow which leaves our high level techs available to help out the lower levels as problems arise, which gives me time to knock out some bug fixes, and continue slamming my head against a wall of SQL development issues I've been working on for a while. 

Which is why it was surprising that, as I tried to glare a PostgreSQL database out of existence, someone started to knock on my desk. I decided not to risk my latent existence wiping powers spontaneously manifesting on this poor level 1 tech, and putting on my best co-worker smile ask what I can help with. I'll spare the long drawn out explanation, but the gist is that a high profile office had requested me specifically to help with a problem. They had recently hired a new office manager, and she was having all sorts of problems. I pull up the account info, notice that I had worked with them on a huge escalation case before, hence the specific request, and then check my e-mail. Which I regret immediately. 

See, my initial plan to tag in a level 3 or 4 tech (which is the normal procedure with these kinds of offices and situations) is immediately shattered, as I notice an email chain, 13 messages deep, with the recipients having all kinds of fun acronyms, starting at the local management letters and ending at... Branch VP. And of course, the last email in the chain is ""ITOverlord, with as much as you wowed this office last time you worked with them, we expect this time to be no different!""... from the VP. 

I start cursing... basically every entity I can, and ready myself to work with the office. Setting the stage now $Me, will be yours truly, $OM will be the beast from ancient times, the new office manager, and $CO will be the pleasant, but entirely clueless owner of the office. 


I put on my best customer service pants (the ones with the elastic removed from the waistband), and give the office a call. 

&gt;$Me: Hey $CO! Just reaching out to see if we can fix the issues $OM is having for you! What's going on?
&gt;$CO: Oh! $Me, thank god! We just hired $OM, her training period ended and she has no access to anything! She says she is having trouble logging in, viewing reports, heck she hasn't even been able to clock in! We want this fixed as soon as possible, because we hired her as a ringer to deal with some of the issues we've been having. We need to leverage her experience as soon as possible, so please get this fixed quick!
&gt;$Me: No worries $CO! I completely understand, give me her info and I'll get to the bottom of this fore you!

So I go to it, I get her info, pop into the DC... and find no issues. Her account is setup with all the privileges and part of all the groups it should be. I remote into an unused workstation, use the creds and boom. No problems. I check their Office software. She's setup as a manager, can pull reports, has printer access, can use the B2B vpn tunnels to the other locations fine... Weird. I jump into HER workstation, maybe its new and things are missing, or its local policies inexplicable went crazy? Nope. Everything works how it should, all functionality as normal. Through this entire process I've been trying to reach $OM, but she wasn't at her desk (couldn't reach her by extension), and apparently wasn't even on her floor according to the random employee I rang to tap her on the shoulder for me. Finally, I give $CO a call, get $OMs cell number after he fails to page her, and ring her up. 

&gt;$Me: Hi $OM! This is $ITOverlord, from $Company, I'm working on your tick-
&gt;$OM: FINALLY, god I have too much to do to be dealing with this crap. Did you get the problems fixed?
&gt;$Me: Well, I looked into it and couldn't find any issues with your accounts or your comp-
&gt;$OM: Liar!

Now... I'm a very reasonable, chill individual. But this took me by surprise. I felt a vein a thought didn't exist anymore pop up on my forehead, both by the tone, and the fact that her voice sounded like sandy winds from a lost time blowing and rasping through catacombs long since forgotten. You know in 'The Mummy' when it firsts resurrects and is speaking while spitting out sand? Like that, but angry and spiteful. 

&gt;$Me: I'm... sorry?
&gt;$OM: Liar. You didn't talk to me about my problems at all. You couldn't have looked into anything! 
&gt;$Me: Well... I spoke with $CO, and had him explain what was going on... then looked into the issues he told me about. I tried to reach you but you weren't at your desk or on your floor...
&gt;$OM: Of course not! What's the point of sitting there if nothings working, I've been in the break room!

Now... I've been working on all this for over an hour at this point. So she has been sitting in the break room... doing nothing, and ignoring the owners pages... for over an hour. 

&gt;$Me: ...Alright, well lets go ahead and get you back there so you can show me what's going on. 
&gt;$OM: *grumbles some ancient curse and makes her way there* Alright, I'm here. Fix it.
&gt;$Me: Of course, let's just get you to log-
&gt;$OM: I can't login it doesn't work. Watch. 

I proceed to spend about five minutes watching her type in everything BUT her username as she tries to get access before taking over and getting her logged in myself. This led to a good 20 minutes argument about what her username was, which I will omit for time and sanity... 

&gt;$Me: Alright, no go ahead and show me what's happening when you try to do anything...
&gt;$OM: I can't nothing looks right and nothing works...

Now... I remember this conversation vividly. For one, it was yesterday, and for two, it is the single most frustrating conversation I've ever had. In my life. And I have five younger siblings. Just thinking about it this morning is making me angry, but reliving it is a bit too much. The gist of it, is that at her old place of employ, they used an older office suite (2003 I came to learn), didn't use $OfficeSoftware, or any industry standard. They didn't have a domain. They used personal email addresses. As it turns out, the office did just about everything manually. As in, on paper. Which is how she expected things to happen here. From how she described things, I also suspect the two (yes two) pcs in her old place of employ to have been windows XP as well...

I spent a solid hour in a constant state of being griped at before I was finally able to wrap it up, ending with this fun exchange...

&gt;$Me, struggling to keep from quite literally exploding: Well, unfortunately $YourCompany has been setup like this for a while so you will need to learn how these systems work. If you need we can setup a training tim-
&gt;$OM: No! Now you listen here. I've been doing this job longer than you've been alive. 58 years. I know what I'm doing, and how things SHOULD be done. You go talk to $CO and get this fixed!

I was then promptly, and thankfully, hung up on. I took a few minutes. Did a lap, stared longingly at coffee, considered a liquor run, contemplated life some, before I finally called $CO. He was expecting me. 

&gt;$CO: Heeey $IT, just got done talking to $OM and I'm a little disappointed... You've spent a lot of time on this, and from what she tells me nothings been fixed. She said you were being quite rude even. What's going on? Do we need to talk to (Mid level manager)?
&gt;$Me: Hey $CO, I think we do actually. We should also pull in (Upper regional manager) as well. 
&gt;$CO, sounding very displeased that I didn't cow: ...Oh? Well what's going on. 
&gt;$Me: **Proceeds to explain in detail the call, from start to finish** Obviously, I don't expect you to just believe me, so I'll send you our calls recordings, of course. 
&gt;$CO: That sounds quite a bit different than what I heard. I'm sure a lot of it is just misunderstandings on her part, so you really should just be patient with her. She's pushing 100 you know. 
&gt;$Me: Oh? I wouldn't have guessed. Like discussed, I'll send the recordings and email (relevant managers) for you. Expect those to come in the next hour or so. 

So I did. I pulled recordings, typed up the e-mail, sent it and then walked to the highest power I had access to in my office. I sat in a nice comfy chair as he looked at my confusedly, watching as he got, then read my e-mail, and had a niiice long conversation. Apparently, several others had read it as well as by the time I got back to my desk there was a chain exploding. 

So here I sit, chuckling and rolling my eyes at a few vaguely insulting/threatening e-mails, knowing full well that only two people listened to the recording. Luckily one of those is the Branch VP, who already assured me (via e-mail no less) that I handled things as good as anyone could be expected to and not to worry. I'm not sure if he is in today due to holiday weekend, but either way I get a bit of amusement while once again trying to glare PGSql out of existence.",talesfromtechsupport,1086,1527255591

DidYouKillMyFather,My branch is closing soon so I'll unhook everything! WCGW?,"This user calls me today and says that his branch was closing in a couple of days, so he ""unhooked everything."" However, he forgot that he needed to print off some shipping labels. I asked him to clarify if he just needs a computer hooked up or something else, to which he responds that no ""I disconnected all the wires in the room with all the wires and big boxes. This translated in my mind as the server room. My translation was correct.

Thankfully, one computer was still connected to the internet, so I remoted into that computer and tried to see if we could have that computer as a place to start troubleshooting. The funny thing is that we could have stopped with the information we had now, but this is when he let me know that he absolutely needed to get some contacts from his Office365 account. The reason why we couldn't is because the port on the switch where the computer still connected was set to only have half of the intranet permissions of a standard PC on the network. So, we needed to get the cable into the right port. 

We spent 5 minutes asking him if one of the boxes had 24 ports on it, to which he replied no. We asked again, and magically one of the boxes gained 12 ports. We checked his computer's port and told him that he needed to move the cable to another port. He did. In the wrong direction. We asked him to do it again, but this time to the opposite end of the switch. He did. Oddly, his intranet permissions stayed with him to that port. We asked him to move it to another port. It did. We couldn't ping the computer. We asked him to reboot the computer, still couldn't ping it. We asked him to ipconfig, his IPv4 address wasn't configured for our network.

We finally asked him to move it one more time, which caused him to still have the half permissions. However, we were almost an hour into the call and he said that the Office365 info wasn't super important, just the shipping label. So we made sure he could print the label. He could. 

So, an hour after the phone call started, through frustration and hundreds of steps taken between the location of the computer and server room, we were finally able to print one measly shipping label. I hope he learned his lesson. Honestly, at the end of the day, I'm just glad  the wall jack was labeled correctly.",talesfromtechsupport,1941,1527117064
Sn0_,I've Never Had a Passcode in the 5 Years I've Owned This Phone,"Recently landed a job at a call center specializing in Wireless Plan Management for other companies. Pretty basic, phone activation, device setup (email, getting them connected to their network, setting up any MDM software), as well as general device troubleshooting (phones, tablets, MiFis, etc).

This call came in today.

**$Me:** Thank you for contacting customer support, this is sn0_, how may I assist you today? 

**User:** Alright so to start off, I'm horrible with technology. 

&gt;I hear this a lot, I think it's probably not as bad as he thinks.

**$User:** But what's goin' on is whenever I try to connect to the internet and go to a website it doesn't load

&gt;With some basic flipping of a virtual switch, I come to find out it works on cellular, but not on WiFi.

**$Me:** So, **$User**, do you by chance have a coworker close by with a work phone that you could ask a question?

&gt;He does, I have him ask if they're able to connect to WiFi on their work phone, **$User** says everything is working on his coworkers end of things.

So I have him go to reset his network settings. When you do this, the device will ask for your passcode.

**$User:** What the hell is a passcode? 

**$Me:** It's what you use to get into your phone, when you unlock it you should usually enter a passcode.

**$User:** I don't know what you're talking about, but I've had this phone for 5 years and I have never had a passcode. 

&gt;His device was an iPhone 6. I checked the purchase date in our internal database, he's had the phone for a little less than 3 years. 

Before I could say a word about what his passcode might be, he wants to troubleshoot on his own

**$User:** But you know what, I'm gonna try some things. Give me a few minutes and I'll call back in to keep trying to fix this damn thing.

**$Me:** Okay sir, thank you you for contacting us today, we will await your call"" 

&gt;About 20 minutes and 1 call later, I just so happen to be the rep he connects to again. He's made absolutely zero progress. 

**$Me:** Can you go ahead and try hitting the lock button on the right side of your phone? And hit it again when the screen goes black so we can get back into your phone.

**User:** Okay, I entered my pin and now what? But now it's still asking me for my damn passcode.

**$Me:** Try your pin, sir. 

Yes, his WiFi worked when his phone was back on. ",talesfromtechsupport,2124,1527044908
TheITCustodian,"The phrases ""not my first rodeo"" and ""if I had a dollar for every time"" confound a user.","I had a support call from our West Coast office this afternoon. 

&gt;$VPAassistant: ""The printer you send us does not work. I would like you to talk to our internship, $Intern.""  

Internship? Huh? Who is this guy?  $VPAssistant hands the phone to $Intern. I have no idea who he is, but like $VPAssistant, English is not his first language.

So I did the usual routine of confirming that it was plugged in, printer power switch turned on, etc.  I mean, its not a new printer, but it was working when it went in the box and according to them there is no evident external damage.

&gt;$Me: ""Is the printer plugged in to a power strip, and is that power strip on?""

Even though $Intern's English wasn't so hot, his indignation was evident over the phone. 

&gt;$Intern: ""I think I would know how to turn on power strip.""

&gt;$Me: ""Look, buddy, this is not my first rodeo with remote troubleshooting. If I had a dollar for every time someone said the power strip was turned on when it was not, well, I wouldn't be asking that question in the first place.""

The ""not my first rodeo"" and ""If I had a dollar"" part went sailing right over his head.

Universal_Binary,"The worst epidemic of component failures ever, caused by a presidential memo. Only the floppies were safe!","This is probably the last of my stories about University Boss.  And it was his most epic ""save the day"" accomplishment while I was there.

**Me**: PFY (jr. systems administrator and support guy) in the Computer Science (CS) Department of a large university.

**Boss**: Sr. CS sysadmin, my boss, and effortless genius at solving bureaucratic and people problems.

**Sandy**: Finance admin.  I don't even remember her name so I'm calling her Sandy.  One of boss's ""friends in low places"" that he liked to brag about.

**Setting**: Late 90s, the midst of the tech boom.

CS enrollment had been skyrocketing, but the department struggled to keep up financially.  Finally one spring, our budget was looking better and Boss and I were planning out some desperately-needed upgrades to servers, desktops, and labs.  As we were about to place orders, the President of the University issued a memo that ran something like this:

&gt; The University is having a cash flow problem.  An analysis has shown dramatic growth in spending for new computers.  Therefore, effective immediately, there is a University-wide freeze on all purchases of computers.  There will be no exceptions.

Of COURSE there was a dramatic growth in PC purchases.  This was the late 90s, when they went from things some people used to things everybody needed.

And it it was bad.  REALLY bad.  As if the Windows 3.1 lab wasn't embarrassing enough, we expected the servers to be completely and utterly unable to handle the load for fall semester.  The chair of the department made a heroic effort to make the case to administration that we were the freaking *Computer* Science department, but made no progress.  So, as usual, it fell to Boss.

Boss called up Sandy in finance.  Boss always helped her out with things, and she helped us out too.

&gt; Boss: ....  so can we buy used computers?

&gt; Sandy: No.

&gt; Boss: Is the money still in our budget?

&gt; Sandy: Yes.

&gt; Boss: So we can still spend the money, just not on computers?

&gt; Sandy: Right.

&gt; Boss: Do they realize how idiotic this is?  It won't save any money, will it?

&gt; Sandy: Of course not.  If the President had asked me, I'd have told him it was stupid.  But nobody ever asks me.  I hear the Board loved his initiative.

&gt; Boss: ...

&gt; Boss: Are we allowed to build a new computer from parts?

&gt; Sandy: No.  That's playing with fire.

&gt; Boss: Are we still allowed to replace parts in existing computers if they have problems?

&gt; Sandy: Yes.

Boss got off the phone with Sandy with a grin.

&gt; Boss: I need you to write a program to test the disks on the main servers.  Take the statistics you have for how much space each account uses, plus our projected enrollment rates for fall.  Write test data that uses that amount of space.

&gt; Me: Uhm, why am I doing this?

&gt; Boss: To solve all our problems, of course.

I was in the dark, but I knew enough to trust Boss by this point.

&gt; Me: Uh, OK.  But I think we won't have enough space.

&gt; Boss: That's fine.  Run it and let me know what happens.

So I wrote the program, ran it, and got the predictable ""out of space"" error.  Boss promptly fired off an order for some larger hard drives to replace the ones that were ""generating errors during testing.""  Ah ha, so THAT'S his plan!

Pretty soon we tested the memory against the projected load, and wouldn't you know it, we got more errors!  But the motherboard wouldn't support enough RAM, so we needed a new motherboard -- and therefore a new CPU -- also.  Maybe even a new power supply.

But never a new case.  And most definitely, never never never was I to touch the inventory sticker.  If I did, someone might think we had purchased a new computer!

So, many of these machines had entirely new guts, just saving their original cases and floppy drives (and sometimes power supplies).

We upgraded all of our most critical servers and two labs full of desktop PCs this way.  By the end of summer, we had almost all of what we wanted in the first place, which was good enough.  Nobody ever questioned it, and if they had, I'm quite sure Boss had filed away all these test reports to justify ""replacing the faulty components.""  He didn't violate the rule -- instead, he made sure to document how carefully he was following it.

And that is how a presidential memo led to the documented failure of hundreds of sticks of RAM, dozens of motherboards, and who knows how many hard drives, all within the period of a few months.

I've never seen anything like it.",talesfromtechsupport,3506,1526919795

TraitorousTraveler,“This includes spit!”,"Pre-text: I’m an electrical engineer who supports induction furnaces. Our furnaces melt anywhere from 1 ton to 100 tons of metal at a time down from scrap metal for foundries. Not your typical tech support. 

When I visit these foundries, I often have to review their safety material. Standard kinda stuff that they give out to contractors before permitting they do work. Often times the bigger companies do this to limit liability and the smaller don’t. 

I was at a medium sized plant in Wisconsin about to do some support on a holding furnace. Before I am allowed to do work I have to review their safety material and sign a few sheets. Kinda standard stuff at plants approaching this size.

As I am flipping through the book I get to the safety section regarding their melters and something peaks my interest. Normally, they’re pretty repetitive, but this page had one rule that I’ve never seen anywhere else: “No water on the operating deck. All water must be in the operators room. This includes spit.”

What? Spit. Why did it have to specify spit? So I ask the maintenance supervisor. 

“Oh well this is something you’ve gotta hear. We had an operator who liked to chew tobacco. Not really an issue as he kept his spit bottle in the operator room. Disgusting, but whatever. He showed up and did his job.

Until one day, he decided to put the spit bottle in the pocket of his shirt as he did his job. At first it wasn’t an issue, until toward the end of the shift when it got more and more full. 

You see he opened the furnace to check temperature visually. As he bent over it spilled out into the furnace. BOOM. Metal flew everywhere. He died in seconds. His body was 90% covered in iron. 

The kicker was his family sued afterwards. They argued that the no water rule was vague and he didn’t know it applied to spit.”

TheLightningCount1,CEO support.,"No fanfare for this one. No embellishments. Just simple fact for this one as it was a huge facepalm when this happened. 

I am up in *another city* this week for a summit at headquarters. This was a situation where a tier 1 support walked into a room and did something that people who knew 7 million programming languages, centuries of experience, and hundreds of degrees and certs could not fix. (Ok I may embellish a little bit.)

We were in all area manager meeting with over 100 people at the meeting. The Cs, Ps, and EVPs, were all up on stage and the CEO was giving the presentation. Now keep in mind this is not a giant auditorium, more of a large conference room. 

The CEO starts clicking and clicking and clicking some more. He sighs and says his laptop is lagging again. Without missing a beat the area manager for the engineers stands up and goes to his PC. He starts running some network tests, other people are testing the physical location, and others still are trying to offer suggestions like a bunch of imperial commanders trying to impress Darth Vader. 

The comical scene unfolded for a bunch of senior programmers, system admins, exchange admins, and basically anyone who is ""smarter"" than the help desk all started scratching their heads. 

I silently walked up to the podium, grabbed a double A energizer out of the pack on the table, and replaced the battery in his wireless mouse. I flipped the switch off and on again telling him to try it now. The look on his face can only be one of doubt to genuine surprise as the lag went immediately away as soon as he tried clicking again. I heard a sigh from behind me and looked to see the face of the sysadmin. His, and everyone else's expression simply said ""Im dumb"" as they shook their heads and sat back down. 

The CEO shook my hand and asked for my name. He thanked me and went back to his presentation. 

When I went back to my seat, I typed up the ticket for what I did for the ceo putting the ticket with him as the requester and me as the tech. Since the ticket had the name of the ceo on it, my inbox blew up with notifications of notes being added to the ticket. A bunch of ""lolol"" or simply ""Wooooooooooow"" or my personal favorite from the CIO himself. ""Never forget the basics people. Thank you Thelightningcount1"" All within the 10 minutes it took me to type this one out from my seat at the conference. ",talesfromtechsupport,2775,1526677048
networkedquokka,How can you run out of isp numbers? There are always more numbers. How can this place even exist?,"An end user is frequently looking up information as she walks around the site. She sees me walking by, flags me down and is pissed beyond words. She has a legitimate case for ambulatory access, but rejects the reasons why things are why they are while also rejecting every offered solution.

I inherited my site which was built by a friend of the owner a decade ago. The IP schema was configured as a /24 with no good way of expanding the range. It can be done, but will take time and money I don't have right now. My fixes are about 18-24 months away on the budget schedule. Not really a problem as long as I am careful not to add too many systems to the network. Plus, it gives me an additional reason to avoid complaints about not allowing personal devices on the network: people often gripe about how THEY won't cause any security problems so could I please add them, but when I say I'll run out of IP addresses they say oh and leave it at that. It sounds computery and that stuff is scary so they are satisfied and drop it.

$her: nobody ever mentioned those, but those are just numbers, right? Numbers are free and they never run out so why do you have a problem with isp numbers?

$me: so how can we fix your problem?

$her: I don't want to have to keep coming back to my computer, it takes 20 minutes to boot and is slow. This is the worst company I have ever worked for and (more angry ranting)

Every solution I offered was shot down. She has her personal tablet and wants to use it on our network.

Would she be happy with a faster desktop? No, because she already has a tablet.

What if I replace the desktop with a laptop? No, because then she will have to carry it around.

She says she has an iPhone, but she is too old to use something with such a small screen.

Can we tether her tablet to the iPhone? No, because it is a 5 and it probably can't do that or her carrier won't let her and no, I can't look and how can we run out of isp numbers?

Can we replace your desktop with a tablet? No, she already has a tablet and how does this place even stay running. Besides, she won't use ebay so can't I just monitor her every move? And there are always more numbers so how can the isp run out of them?

hsxp,Sometimes one person shouldn't hold all the equipment purchasing power.,"Names are all fake.

So this was several years ago. I worked at a small company I hated for political and ethical reasons but stayed at for contractual reasons.

I was hired as a developer for a six month contract. They didn't have room near the other devs for a desk, so they stuck me in a storage room by myself with the biggest desk I'd ever seen. Apparently our new ex-banker CEO ditched the big desk to look less rich (this was not long after the recession started). Also in this storage room were boxes and boxes of... Routers? Switches? Servers? Speakers? What did a small middleman company need with half a data center of equipment?

I learned that this stuff was for our planned ""disaster recovery infrastructure,"" but the specifics of that plan were never made clear. It was always ""$Jake's working on DR so he'll get that stuff out of your hair soon!"" I didn't care about any of these people or this company so I didn't press it.

One day, near the end of my contract, $Jake quits unexpectedly with no two weeks. Management was like, ""Shit, what do we do with all this DR junk?"" Apparently they'd never actually looked at the stuff or the receipts. None of it made any sense; he'd blown $30,000 on unopened, out-of-date equipment that couldn't possibly be cobbled into something useful.

They decide to abandon the project entirely and try to return all the equipment. They found the seller's website while looking for contact information, and...

There's $Jake.

Front and center, one of their upper executives.

He'd taken this job and used his position to buy tens of thousands' worth of excess stock at his own company. Lots of screaming was heard for days.

Zeewulfeh,More from Aviation Maintenance: Exciting Training,"Reminded by [this post,](https://redd.it/8jux7a) here’s a story from when I was first getting trained on aircraft engines…

***

Because of the vast differences in background and experience new Soldiers can have, the very beginning of Aircraft Powerplant Training was focused on the basic physics behind jet turbines, their principles of operation, basic tool instruction and safety practices.  Among the various “don’t put your hand in there,” “cover all engine openings to prevent foreign object damage” and “protect your eyes” safety rules, there were several electrical practices that were emphasized to us.  Foremost among those was “prior to working on the exciter, use an INSULATED HANDLE screwdriver to push the electrical lead against the engine case to ground the system, once it is disconnected from the ignitor.”  

&gt;*$RandomTFTSReader* “Zee, what’s an exciter?  And why?”

Thanks for asking, $RandomTFTSReader, I’m happy to explain!

An exciter is essentially a box filled with capacitors used to power an ignitor (spark plug) during engine start and certain operation modes.  The amount of power that comes out exciter is rather large—the instructors emphasized just how dangerous the output was with descriptions of unfortunate mechanics being flung across hangars and off aircraft.  A typical exciter for an [Allison 250]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allison_Model_250) (used in the OH58D Kiowa, Star Vipers and numerous other aircraft) has a peak output current of 825A, peak voltage of 11.3kV and puts out around 10-12 sparks/second at 28VDC.  

It’s a bad day in a box no larger than a paperback novel.

***

It was our second day on the schoolhouse floor actually working engines and [Joey](https://redd.it/71qg4j) and I were assigned to work with one another tearing down an Allison 250.  Because of the design of the engine, one of the very first tasks is removing the ignitor, ignitor lead, and the exciter.  Joey would take that task while I worked on removing the fuel system. I wasn’t paying too much attention to what Joey was doing, so I never saw him disconnect the exciter. One of our instructors did and as I reached out and touched the engine, he shouted at us.

&gt;*Instructor*  “Hey!  ZeeWulf!  Stop! Lie down on the floor, you just died!  Joey, you just killed Zee!”

Confused, I laid down as was instructed.  A second instructor came over and grimly pulled out some chalk with which he proceeded to trace my outline on the floor.  

&gt;*Instructor* “Okay, Zee, get up.  You’re done for the day, you now just have to stand back and haunt Joey as he works alone.”

&gt;*Joey* “What? That’s not fair, what’d I do wrong?”

&gt;*Instructor*  You never grounded out the exciter, and you didn’t warn ZeeWulf you’d disconnected the lead.  You got him killed.  I want you to think long and hard about that.”

***

The next day I returned to work, but the chalk outline remained—we were responsible for mopping up our area at the end of the day and they’d instructed us to let it stay as a reminder. It wasn’t the only mistake any of us made that week; later that week Shaver and Axe-Man returned from lunch to find every orifice of their engine stuffed with shredded newspaper—they’d forgotten to cap the holes for the ignitor, fuel nozzle and bleed air tubes.  To add insult to injury, the instructor explained that due to their lack of attention to detail, the engine was released and put on Joey’s helicopter and got him killed.  Shaver was instructed to write a letter of notification to ‘Mrs. Joey and family’ and explain how he got ‘her husband’ killed.  

Shaver opened it with “To Mrs. Joey and my children…”

TL;DR, Always get it in writing.


I work for an events office at a university running a Campus/Student Center as well as several other satellite event locations, and part of that job includes providing tech support for meetings. Everything from setting up mics and projectors to video conferencing to basic windows troubleshooting and everything in between. I've got tons of stories from that, but I'm going to start with this one as another story here reminded me of it. (Details and timeline fudged to keep stuff anonymous.)


A couple winters back the university was going through it's re-accreditation process. For those unfamiliar with the processes the tl;dr version is it's a **Big Deal** and all the higher ups are involved including the $Chancellor's Chief of Staff (CCoS). The accreditation can affect everything from a school's grants, state, and federal funding to students applying to said university ability to get financial aid. 


We'd been leading up to this meeting for weeks. There would be a site visit with the folks from the accreditation board where they would tour the campus, meet some students at the Student Center, some official, some ""spontaneous."" The whole thing would kick off at 8 am with a conference call to other sister campuses. Everyone was completely on edge about this meeting and I was looking forward to seeing the tail end of it.


The day before the meeting it starts snowing. And it snows. And snows. *And snows.* We're talking record breaking levels here. We ended up getting dismissed from work early. The President of the University and the Vice Chancellor of HR send out the ""Don't come to work tomorrow unless you are essential personnel"" email. The Governor issues a state of emergency and says everyone except emergency vehicles should stay off the roads. I tuck in for the night content in the knowledge that my son and I will get to have a great day at home having snowball fights and building snow caves.


Well, the next morning rolls around and I wake up to my work cell ringing. I have a strict ""off-hours"" policy so I put my work cell on Do Not Disturb mode from 12 am-6 am. I've got something like 20 missed calls and texts. But now the $CCoS is calling my personal cell. I don't even know how he got my personal cell number as I only ever gave that number to my work wife. Something very bad is happening.


$me: Hello?


$CCoS: Where the *$%@ are you? Why is the Campus Center closed! Where is everyone? The accreditation officers will be here in an hour! We need to get everything up and running!


*Where do you think I am you moron? There's two feet of snow outside.*


$me: I'm at home. The Campus is closed. The governor has issued a state of emergency. I'm not allowed out on the roads.


$CCoS: I don't care! These accreditation officers are only in town today so we are going to go through with this meeting. I need the building unlocked and the conference equipment running! And we need those students that are supposed to be part of the tour.


*you serious? Half my staff are commuters. I'm not going to risk their safety and make them come in. And the ones that do live on campus, I'm not going to make them come in either, you f-ing nut job, I'd have to pay them extra to get them to come in.*


$me: Well, the video conferencing system is plug and play, and I can get facilities to clear the sidewalk but they'll probably charge extra, and I can probably get campus security to come in and unlock the building and staff the front desk, but that's another cost. As for staffing, I cannot make it in, there's two feet of snow outside my house, and a good portion of my students commute so I can't ask them to come in either as I can't ask them to risk their safety. What I can do is ask if anyone who lives on campus is willing to volunteer to come in. But that's an extra charge. And I can't promise they will want to come in.


$CCoS: Just make it happen! This is a critical meeting and **everything** has to be perfect. *Do whatever it takes to make this happen.*


$me: *Foreseeing a trap* Alright. But I'm going to need this in writing. Can you please send it to me in an email?


$CCoS: Yes. Fine. Whatever. *click*


Two minutes later, sure enough, I get an email from him. *""The Accreditation Meeting is going forward as planned. The Center needs to be open by 8am. Pull whatever resources you need to make this happen.""*


Armed with those magic words I went to work. Being in events, you have to make quick friends with Security and Facilities (and IT), so I got on the horn with both departments and acknowledged that I'd have to pay extra to get them focused on the Student Center, but I let them know that the $CCoS made it very clear that I had to get this done no matter what. Yes, there's an extra emergency charge, plus the 4 hour minimums, but we have to make it happen. Yes, I will also send this in an email so you are covered. Then I find a couple of my student staff who live in the dorms close by that were willing to come through the storm for a little extra emergency pay.


The event went off without a hitch, but the $CCoS was not happy when he got his giant bill afterwards. Fortunately, since I had just sent the bill in reply to his ""Make this happen at all costs"" email, I was in the clear.",talesfromtechsupport,1519,1526513685
Gambatte,Encyclopædia Moronica: E is for Early Morning Emergencies,"Winter is coming.  
- *some guy on a TV show*

---

In the Southern Hemisphere, we are entering the cold season. Each day, temperatures are significantly cooler than the last, and this is even more true during the hours of darkness.  
So while the temperature under the bed covers remains relatively constant, by virtue of the increased differential, it is increasingly more pleasant, more desirable to stay in bed as long as possible.

So it was with great reluctance that I sleepily snaked my arm out from under the mountain of covers to swat at the offending noise. As my brain slowly dragged itself out of sleep and higher functions returned, I recognised the sound as my work phone ringing.

I attempted to gather my scattered thoughts as I answered it.

&gt; ME: Ugh... I mean, hello?

&gt; Dispatch (D): Hey G. Did I wake you?

&gt; ME: Not at all, I'm always up at, uh... Wait, why am I awake at 5 A.M.?

&gt; D: You know *{site}*?

&gt; ME: Vaguely? They shut down a few months back.

&gt; D: Well, they've just re-opened, under new management.

&gt; ME: Let me guess - something's gone wrong for the first time since they took over, and now they're panicking, because this has literally NEVER happened before in the whole six times they've opened the site for the day.

&gt; D: You got it, man.

&gt; ME: Yeah, fine - let me finish rubbing the sleep from my eyes and I'll get down there ASAP.

&gt; D: All good - I'm still fighting the new job system, but you should have it in the app by the time you get there.

I carefully flung back the covers, taking care not to disturb my wife. I did disturb my cat, who glared obscenities at my retreating back before going back to sleep.  
Three minutes later, I was showered and dressed. I checked the new job system - the company had only started using it a few days prior - but the job had not appeared in the app. There was an email with all of the relevant information, however, so I carried on - the email clearly indicated that the entire site was offline, so urgency was about as high as it gets.

Ten minutes later, I pulled in to the site's parking lot - fortunately, it was only across town. The front door was open, so I let myself in. A young dark-skinned woman was at the counter, so I introduced myself.

&gt; ME: Hi, I'm Gambatte, from *{company}*.

This was reinforced by the branded hi-visibility vest, shirt, and baseball cap that I wore.

&gt; ME: I understand you're having some issues this morning?

From my pocket, my work phone buzzed. I ignored it, because face-to-face conversations generally take priority.

&gt; Manager (M): Oh, not any more.

&gt; ME: Really?

&gt; M: Yes, I was able to get it working - I just had to press the black button! I told the man on the phone this a little while ago.

I guessed that the buzzing was D, attempting to let me know that I no longer needed to attend - useful information to receive when you're already there. I would later discover that this guess was correct.

The sleepy part of my brain suggested turning on my heel and grabbing some more sleep before actual work hours started.  
My mouth didn't get this message, though.

&gt; ME: I see. Well, as I'm here now, I might as well check the equipment, just to see if there's anything we can do to prevent the issue from happening again.

&gt; M: Okay.

M led me into a back office. Under the desk, I could see a white six socket power board. M indicated to the RESET button on the side of it. This button was black.

&gt; M: That's what I had to press.

&gt; ME: Okay, I'll have a quick look and see what I can see.

M ducked back out to the site floor as I investigated. The power board I could see had only two plugs connected, and neither of them were for my equipment.  
Curious.  
I decided to start at my equipment, as I knew this had to have been affected. The equipment was plugged in to the multiple outlets of a single UPS, which was in turn fed power from... a black six socket power board.  
Huh. The black power board was fed power from... the white power board. Every socket on the black power board was full.  
The last socket on the black power board provided power to... another black six socket power board. Which was also completely full.

In total, one wall socket had been connected to enough daisy-chained power boards to provide 18 outlets, of which 12 were in use - and most of the remaining outlets were in prime position to be accessed by staff members.

And on these cold wintry nights, who wouldn't want to plug in a space heater...

---

As best I could determine, the overcurrent circuit in the first power board had been triggered, killing power to everything downstream. When the Manager pressed the black RESET button, she restored power, and somehow the startup/inrush current from all of the connected equipment was not enough to immediately trip it again.  
This was particularly surprising, as the UPS had provided power until it had automatically shut down, so was entering charging mode once power restored.

I pulled out my phone and snapped a few photos of the power arrangement, which I then put into an email to the new owner, along with a few words explaining how ""a temporary condition (like a heater or a vacuum cleaner being plugged in) may have easily tipped the overcurrent protection, causing the issue. Redistributing the equipment to additional power circuits may be all that is required to prevent the issue from reoccurring"", or words to that effect.

A few days later, I received the following response (verbatim):

&gt; NEW OWNER: Thanks for bringing the issue to my notice - I have 6 extra wall sockets in that same small office room; I will distribute the use of the power to the balance 6 extra wall sockets. I realise we have being using this side of the wall socket.

It's been a few weeks now. The nights have continued to get colder and the bed warmer and more enticing, yet I haven't had to go back - at least, not so far...",talesfromtechsupport,664,1526510150

lawtechie,"Despite our incompetence, we didn't do _that_","I'm a part of a team doing a security evaluation of a health information company, HealthCo. HealthCo is one of those health care ecosystem companies that doesn't provide healthcare or payment, but instead does some kind of information processing that is why you have to call some help line to get a procedure or drug approved.  
 
Typical of the big consulting firm I'm working for, I only know my little slice of the project- social engineering. I've been tasked with trying to trick the targeted employees of HealthCo to either give me credentials via phishing emails or insert USB drives with a little 'phone home' script into their workstations.  

I'm very comfortable with the former, but my Java skills aren't up to snuff, so I'm spending a lot more time modifying a coworker's java app to phone home when clicked, but not break anything else. I am reminded why I'm not a Java developer and just change the icon on some HTML that will call an unique web bug (a 1x1 clear pixel) that will identify the USB drive. To ensure maximum clicks, I name the doc 'Payroll.xls.html'.  
 
I'm planning on sending the phishing emails a day or two before I'm on-site, where I'll drop the drives, wait a day and write my report. I fly out and drive my shitty rental car to HealthCo's offices the night before. I drop a third of the drives in the parking lot, then piggyback someone going into the office to drop them around the building. I find my way back to my consultant kennel. Sadly, the only restaurant walking distance from my hotel is an Applebee's, so Brewtus and I start writing the filler for HealthCo's report over some rubbery chicken wings.  
 
The next day, I check and see that I'm around 50% for my phish and about a third of my USB devices have been plugged in. I also see an email from the client. They have some _grave_ concerns about our test and want to talk about it.  
 
I throw my suit on and take my 'other fine car' to HealthCo's offices. I'm escorted to the Director of Security's offices. They've collected a bowl of my thumb drives like the least appetizing candy dish ever. There's also a suspiciously clean cut security engineer here with a laptop and a smile that tells me he thinks he's got me dead to rights.  
 
Director:""We specifically asked that you not use malware for your social engineering test. Because of your malware, we ended the test and emailed everybody to bring us any drives they find.""
 
me:""We didn't generate malware. We decided to go with a HTML file instead of a Java dropper. For compatibility reasons.""  
 
Security Engineer(gesturing at the spreadsheet on his laptop):""Your malware captured PHI to the drive. That's outside the rules of engagement""  
 
me:""I assure you- I didn't write anything to break into your systems. I wrote a simple web page. Wait a minute, let me show you something""  
 
I reached into the bowl and showed them a few of 'my' drives. Each had been marked with a felt tip pen. Drives intended for the parking lot got two dots, while drives dropped inside the building had a small line. It was a way to make sure I spread them effectively without losing track.  
 
I showed the Director and the engineer my marks. The Director looked unamused while the engineer looked like he wanted to wish one of my marks onto the drive he had.  
 
me:""I can tell you what my recommendations are- DLP, turn off USB drives and perhaps some training. You're going to have to figure out who is losing drives full of unencrypted PHI in your parking lots.

MediocreSupport,We did not do it because no one told us to Part 2,"My apologies for the long wait gents. Here is part 2. 
#Intro

Some time ago at a previous assignment I was in a team of 10 people supporting 1st line IT needs of a user base of 2500 users in a colossal international company $BlackSugaryLiquid. Our team was efficient and structured and led by a competent young lady $MissBoss. We would handle all sorts of office and production related IT problems and would resolve quite a lot of them ourselves. Some of our tickets we would have to escalate to back line teams, who would in turn kick it back to us when they had a solution. $BlackSugaryLiquid, while having lots of sites in different countries, had the habit of outsourcing key IT components to the South of the Himalayas ($HCL henceforth) and other low wages countries. This was met with much frustration of everyone within IT and outside of IT, since you receive the quality for which you pay.

I write this from memory so details I no longer remember could be left out

#Once more, into the breach
The first week following the $Crypto nuke it was the talk of the day; every day. Many emails came and went, (irrelevant) contact information was exchanged and an effort was made by $Bigbosses to enlighten users on the dangers of bizarre emails in the form of an upcoming surprise test. This test would later prove to be an obvious fake email along the lines of “CLICK ME AND YOU WILL GET MONEY”. Users who would click the link would get written down, while the ones who reported this to the appropriate authorities would get a shiny worthless certificate in outstanding IT security made in MS paint according to a colleague.

Among all of this buzz there was still a sore spot that had not been addressed: $ITSecurity. We had not heard from them since the initial disaster and we assumed they had their leashes pulled tight; even $MissBoss did not have any news regarding the follow up of $ITsecurity and what they would do to prevent total meltdowns in the future.

The answer came a mere 2 weeks later after the first disaster. In the $Finance department yet again a malicious email was received and converted into a ticket by $Tool. Some unlucky sucker from $Finance opened the ticket and attachment and all hell broke loose once again. From his PC it hopped through the shared network drive onto the server and began its onslaught once again. The only thing that stood between $Crypto2 and its end goal of completion was the sheer amount of data itself. If you throw enough bodies at something it will take some time.

When we received the phone call that informed us of the news we were flabbergasted. Dumbfounded. Bamboozled. Not only had $Tool not been subjugated to severe scrutiny by $ITsecurity, disaster 2 had occurred exactly the same way as disaster 1. An email to $ITsecurity was send (yes, still no phone number) and while we were waiting in anxiousness loads of verbal insults and cries of lamentation were heard around the office. A high priority ticket was raised once more and $MissBoss was escalating things, desperately trying to get things moving. 

Luckily for the entire company $BigBoss had a direct phone number this time for $ITsecurity somewhere written down on a post it and after a full hour after our first email they responded. It still took them 2 more hours to actually DO something as they were waiting for approval to get the server detached from the network to begin their cleaning. After a total of 4 hours after the initial phone call the server was completely detached and wiped. Steps were taken to perform a restoration from backup. The following part will be forever etched in my memory when it was relayed by $Missboss to us. She was in the emergency conference call regarding all this and when it came to the part to restore the backups the conversation proceeded like this:

&gt;$Biggerboss: Alright, the disaster seems to be diverted. We can proceed with the restoration, you have my approval.
&gt;
&gt;$ITsecurity: OK, give us some time to do the needful.

Note: They were quite fond of this saying. 15 minutes passed had passed and then...

&gt;$Biggerboss: any status update?
&gt;
&gt;$ITsecurity: …
&gt;
&gt;$Biggerboss: Well?
&gt;
&gt;$ITsecurity: It would seem that after disaster 1 all types of backups were disabled and not been reinitiated afterwards. As of now the most recent backup we have is from 2 weeks ago from before disaster 1.

Note2: keep in mind that this encompassed the entirety of all the financial data + other important documents of all the European sites.
After this statement a full minute of silence was maintained over the conference call. All involved parties were slowly realizing the extent of having no backups for 2 weeks. A pandemonium rose up as everyone started shouting at once trying to get the upper hand. Nothing constructive was blurted and none of the words that actually could be understood were rated PG 13. 

Being the alpha male $Biggerboss let himself be known throughout the chaos: he demanded silence and asked in a civil manner and yet with barely unrestrained anger:

&gt;$Biggerboss: Can you inform us as to why the backups were not switched back on after disaster 1?
&gt;
&gt;$ITSecurity: We did not do it because no one told us to.

I get an email from $IU telling me: ""You broke my Chrome. Now nothing works and I cannot do my job. You need to fix Chrome now"" and he copied about every VP and Manager that I knew of at the company.

I have no idea of anyone's technical knowledge yet, so I figure it was something dumb. Maybe he deleted a shortcut or can't figure out how to find his favorites. 

Anyways, I give $IU a call and remote connect to his machine. I quickly see Chrome pinned to his task bar, open it up, and browse to a web page.

&gt;$IU: That's not the Chrome I use.
&gt;$Me: It's not the Chrome you use?

I'm completely confused at this point. Maybe thinking he has a different third party browser, possibly something malicious, installed. 

&gt;$Me: Can you show me?

The user navigates to the Start Menu and opens Excel. He then proceeds to type a web address into the formula bar and exclaims...

&gt;$IU: See, the page is not loading. It just shows as blue text. Chrome is broken after you made my computer do updates. 
&gt;$Me: This is Microsoft Excel, not Chrome. You should not be using this to browse the internet. Use the Icon I used *I moved the cursor in circles over the Chrome icon*

I had just set up his PC and he managed to set up his local windows account before I transferred a bunch of stuff, mainly family photos from 2008 through 2016 with the use of a thumb drive.


A few weeks pass and he really, really messed something up. I don't know what he did, but something fucked over his profile in such a way where I had to make a new one. So I just did it. It never crossed my mind that all those family photos was there before my father pointed it out. I freak out a little bit now, because I let it slip over my head.


I quickly download recuva and try to pull a lucky shot by trying to recover them onto an external HDD with no luck. 


The anxiety is growing on me now, and I tell him I'll fix it and get them back. After hours of googling, browsing through tech support subreddits and considering just shushing it away the anxiety just snaps and I start shaking, because it simply *can't afford to loose these photos.*


But then a lightbulb lights up in my head. The thumb drive. *The damn thumb drive.* I hadn't used it since I copied over those files. I rush into my room and start looking for it. Not on my desk. Not in my drawer. The I realised, it's in my backpack. I almost tear it open, and uses recuva to grab them off it. 


It worked.

I look at my wifi indicator and sure enough, no wifi. The lights are on, so it can't be power to the wireless access point... but... now i hear beeping. Lots of beeping. It sounds like UPS's switching over to battery power and beeping to tell the user to shut down their computer, that they've lost power. We're having parts of our office lose power, and other parts not lose power. What the fuck is going on. couple minutes later, all power is out. 

Turns out, our maintenance department was welding, and our building didn't have enough juice to power everything so we were essentially having our office brown out, but then a 600amp fuse in our electrical box out back blew, and we lost all power to the building. Awesome, I get to go home early. 

**May 9th, 9:15 AM**

I've been at work about 30 minutes by now, on my second cup of coffee, when one of our employees walks into my hallway (I don't really have an office... I'm kind of in a hallway... long story) We're doing to call this employee $Kia, short for Know It All. I'll be $JD. 

$Kia: ""Hey, $JD. When the power went out yesterday, it fried my computer. I need a new one.""

$JD: ""Did you not shut it down when your UPS started beeping?""

$Kia: ""What's a UPS?""

$JD: ""It's the giant black power strip that your computer and one of your monitors is plugged into. In the case of a power outage, it will power your computer long enough to save your work and power down your computer safely.""

$Kia: ""I don't have one of those."" 

$JD: ""Yes you do, i set up your workstation.""

$Kia: ""yeah but i moved my desk to the other side of the room, and didn't know what that was so when i moved it, i didn't use that thing.""

$JD: sigh... ""OK, let me go take a look.""

I walked over to that set of offices (We have two sets of offices in our building with a warehouse and production facility in between them). I get to his desk, sit down, press the power button, and i see the computer light up and come to life.

$JD: ""$Kia, I just pushed the power button and it came on...""

$Kia: ""I'm not an idiot. I know how to turn it on. But nothing happens on the screen.""

$JD: ""Well, did you try..."" *pushes the power button to the monitor* ""turning the monitor on?"" *monitor lights up, straight to log in screen*

wallacehacks,Traitor....,"So a month or so ago Steam and Battle.net were banned from our work computers. You try and launch them and you are greeted with a message informing you that the network administrator has banned this program.

Everyone was disappointed but understood. We figured someone with power had walked through the room while two techs were engaged in Hearthstone antics and had complained to our director and that was that. 

Today I was doing some PC cleanup. I pull up my programs list and see my installed Steam games and figure I'll uninstall them since I can't enjoy them on my lunch break anymore. I click on uninstall and the Steam login pops up. I login to Steam to start the uninstall but then I realize I've just discovered something wonderful. 

I realized I can begin to uninstall a Steam game to bypass the network policies preventing me from launching it. Cancel the uninstall, launch a game, there it is. I ask my coworker to try the same thing with Hearthstone and voila, he's in! 

I tell my fellow Tier 1's and we all share a good laugh. We aren't going to risk our jobs to play Hearthstone at lunch but we are still amused with the workaround. We decide to show the Director what we have discovered. Turns out, he didn't even know Steam and Battle.net are blocked. 

The call to block these games was not made by our manager, our Director, our CIO nor anyone who is actually in charge of us. One Tier 2 took it upon himself to enact this network policy. 

He's been a Tier 2 for six months. He literally was in our seats playing these games and living this life six months ago. Our ticket counts are in better shape than they were when he was doing our job. There had been no complaints or even discussions about the change.

I'm sure sneaky behavior without management approval and betrayal will take him far in his career. 

*TL;DR: Guy gets promoted to Tier 2 tech and thinks he is CIO. Blocks our access to games (poorly) and is a hypocrite. *",talesfromtechsupport,1156,1525895705
Universal_Binary,Network enlightenment with a borderline-illegal punch tool,"By, er, popular demand, another story about University Boss!

**Me**: A PFY (jr. sysadmin/support person) in a large university's computer science department.

**Boss**: Sr. Computer Science sysadmin, my supervisor, bureaucratic genius, and all-around good guy.  Hero of several previous stories I've posted.

**PP**: Physical Plant, the buildings &amp; grounds maintenance department.

**Scene**: We need to run an Ethernet cable from a room to an adjacent room.  About 20 years ago.  The doors to these rooms had a nice gap underneath (this is important).

&gt; Boss: Just get a 50' UTP cable and run it under the door like the other two that are already there.

&gt; Me: Wouldn't it be better to do it properly?  Through the walls with RJ45 jacks and all that?

&gt; Boss: Trust me, under the door is way better.

&gt; Me: That doesn't make any sense.

&gt; Boss: Let me tell you a story.  Physical Plant (PP) is unionized here.  Their contract says that if any of certain kinds of work is to be done, it MUST be done by unionized PP people.  Non-unionized workers doing union work is one of the few things that can get a person fired almost instantly at a university.  A few years ago, they got network cable installation and repair added to that list.  So it would be illegal and could get the University sued if somebody else did the cabling.  

&gt; Me: That sounds annoying, but...

&gt; Boss: Also nobody trained PP how to do data cabling.

&gt; Me: ...

&gt; Boss: So here's how it goes.  You put in a work order, they show up in a week or two, about an hour before quitting time.  They put up a ladder, take down a ceiling tile, and dangle an Ethernet cable from the ceiling, then leave early for the day.  They'll come back the next day about an hour before lunch, do 10 minutes of work, then leave early for lunch.  Several days later, the network run will be done, and they'll leave.  You will then discover it doesn't work.  If you are particularly unlucky, you will also discover several existing connections that had nothing to do with the change are also broken.

&gt; Me: But I still think that we should do it properly.

&gt; Boss: You still have much to learn.  Fine.  We'll try it your way.  You'll see.  Shall we ask them to cable up those two existing runs under the doors ""properly"" also?

&gt; Me: That sounds good.

So sure enough, just as Boss predicted, a week later a PP cable installer shows up, not long before lunch.  I walk by the room a few minutes later, there's a ladder, a hole in the ceiling, and no installer.  A few days later, the work order is closed and the ladder is gone.

&gt; Boss: Follow me.

I follow Boss into one of the rooms.  Hanging out of the wall are three Ethernet cables with RJ45 ends on them.  One of the cables has a wire sticking out next to the RJ45 end, not IN it.  Also, no plates.  No jacks.  No electrical box.  Just an ugly-looking hole in the drywall with wires hanging out.

&gt; Me: Uhmmm...  You did ask for jacks, right?

&gt; Boss: Of course.

&gt; Me: What now?

&gt; Boss: I make a work order for them to fix it.

A week or so passes, and now the cables are punched down into jacks -- but still no wall plate, still just hanging out of a hole.  Another week or two and they're in a plate looking all proper.

&gt; Boss: Why don't you go test the new runs.

&gt; Me: Sure thing, Boss!

It should be no surprise to you at this point that zero out of three network ports worked.

&gt; Me: ... and so I guess we need to make a work order for PP to figure out what's wrong with the runs.

&gt; Boss: They will refuse to do that, on the grounds that it's not in their job description.  They will INSTALL and REPAIR but not DIAGNOSE.

&gt; Me: How do we deal with this then?

Boss then, with a hint of fear and a measure of secrecy, produces a punch tool I didn't even know he had (I think it was stashed behind a bunch of old [thinwire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE2) NICs), took me to the jack in question, and educated me on the art of Ethernet termination, pointing out the color legend on the back side of the jacks and how the cabling didn't match it.

Now you've got to understand about Boss, he was a genius about navigating bureaucracy, but he always stayed strictly within the letter of the rules.

&gt; Boss: I am telling you, you are not permitted to repair this cable.  However, in order to figure out whether the problem was incorrect termination, you may need to move these wires.  I will let you figure it out from here.  Oh, and keep the door locked while you're using the punch tool.  In fact, just keep the punch tool completely out of sight.  Got it?

I proceed to re-punch the connections into the jacks.  Wonder of wonders, they seem to work.  I go back to Boss's office.

&gt; Boss: So what did you do?

&gt; Me: Well, I....

&gt; Boss: And before you say anything, pretend I'm the dean.  Think carefully.

&gt; Me: Ah.  Well, I, uh...  diagnosed... them.  And, uh, all of a sudden they worked.

&gt; Boss: And...?

&gt; Me: And... uhm...  maybe they were working all along and I just did something wrong?

&gt; Boss: You just took a step towards enlightenment.  Well done, grasshopper.

&gt; Me: Thanks!

&gt; Boss: Now let me ask you a question.  What do you think the likelihood is, that on at least one of those new runs, you'll find they ran out of cable and used 8 poorly-attached wire nuts to splice cables together?

&gt; Me: Uh... I'm starting to get the feeling like I'd rather not answer that question.

&gt; Boss: Another step towards enlightenment.  Would you like to crawl up in the ceiling and inspect the runs?

&gt; Me: Uhm.  I think it would be better not to know.

&gt; Boss: Yes.  And next time I tell you to run Ethernet cables under the door, what are you going to do?

&gt; Me: Trust that you know what you're doing?

&gt; Boss: You'll make Jedi yet, young padawan!",talesfromtechsupport,1446,1525887776
TheLightningCount1,A tale of two consultants. No not the office space kind of consultants. Wait what? These are definitely the office space kind of consultants.,"Over the past month our company decided to ""shake things up"" and bring in a consulting firm to help ""bring efficiency to the next level."" At first everyone was very wary that this would be an resume generating event. However consulting company sent out a memo to all employees. 

They stated that their goal is not to ""synergize the core values with productivity paradigm shifts."" Basically this memo called out all of the BS terms that companies like to use and made fun of them. They stated their core goal was to look at our P&amp;P and work out how to deal with them. 

When it came to our turn for the consultants, at first they were very helpful. They mentioned that we were taking a few unnecessary steps in fixing common issues. 

For instance when outlook refuses to take the correct password on local desktop, you do not have to rebuild outlook profile everytime. A time save would be hitting ""other user"" and having the user do a full login again instead of rebuilding the outlook profile. 

Or in the case of printers. IF the IP address changes on the printer, you do not always have to reinstall it. Can simply go to printer properties and change the port. 

All of these were things that I knew and thought my team knew, but that was not the case. I had lapsed in getting KB articles out to the team for these and people were fixing issues using methods that took longer. 

I thought this was the end of it. 

Last monday. 

I come into the office and am pulled into the conference room with the head of IT, EVP of IT, and VP of networking. These consultants were done playing good cop and were auditing the tickets and calls. 

At first they ran through a TON of minor issues and ignoring them as they went on until they ""noticed a trend"" amongst some of my golden employees. The ones I refuse to let go without a damn good reason. 

&gt; $C1 = Consultant 1 or bob  
&gt; $C2 = Consultant 2 or bob  
&gt; $VPN = VP of Networking or Kara Thrace  
&gt; $HIT = Head of IT or William Adama  
&gt; $Me = Gul Dukat  
&gt; $EVPIT  = Obi Wan Kenobi 

So the first one they sent my way was a simple one. 

&gt; $C1 - We have pulled up a few glaring examples here and we wanted your input.  

&gt; $ME - *Takes a look at the ticket in question* So the user wanted us to open corrupted PDF files for them and send them back. We informed the user that the files were corrupted and closed the ticket.  

&gt; $C2 - But it did not stay closed.  

&gt; $Me - Right because the manager and the LO in this ticket had an email conversation with each other while still CCing IT and reopening the ticket over and over again.  

&gt; $C1 - So you are saying it was not the Techs fault for being unable to keep the ticket closed?  

&gt; $me - *My leg stops shaking, my breath goes still, my eyes lock in on C1 and C2 and I open my mouth to speak*  

&gt; $Hit - You do not work in our environment on the day to day and have no real grasp of the way things operate. From out outsider's perspective, this ticket looks bad. But that is why we are here as managers to look at this and show you, the outside consultant, why this is perfectly acceptable.  *Sideways glance at me in what I can only assume was a ""stop it."" glare.*  

&gt; $VPN - How many more tickets do you have like that?  

&gt; $C2 - We pulled out 12 tickets like that where the tech was unable to keep the ticket closed. 

The room goes silent. 

&gt; $ME - *My eyes lock in and I exhale slowly.*  

&gt; $VPN - *oblivious* Then skip over those. They are a waste of our time. 

The consultants pulled four tickets to the top. 

&gt; $C1 - Here is one that counts. (Name of tech) helped (user) out on March 5, 6, 7, 12, and 22nd, on what looks like an outlook issue.  

&gt; $C2 - Ticket came in on the 4th at right before midnight and got picket up first thing as the tech came in. That is normal. The tech called the user and got voicemail leaving a message. The user called back 2 hours later and the tech was able to figure out the issue was with her account and not email. An old Ipad had her account on it and kept locking her account from automated bad password tries. 

He takes a drink of water. 


&gt; $c2 - The next day the user responded saying that she only turned the old Ipad on for a second and it auto locked her again. She wanted assistance removing the account from the ipad so it never happened again.  

&gt; $C1 - This was the first instance of the tech failing to keep the ticket closed.  

&gt; $me - *My hands tighten in a very Gendo Ikari like pose*  

&gt; $C2 - The tech cleared the account off the ipad remotely and unlocked the account again letting the user know that her password was set to expire in 16 days. The user said she would change it herself. The next day her manager replied to the ticket opening it again. That was the second instance of the tech failing to keep the ticket closed by the way. Now the manager was just thanking the tech for the help so we wont count that one. However it does help us establish a pattern.  

A message over lync came in from $Hit and $EVPIT. ""The leash has come off."" I replied with. ""I will let the man finish first.""

&gt; $c2 - Then on the 12th the user replied back stating it was happening again. The tech split the ticket off as it was a separate issue. Appears to have been a simple citrix login issue as logging out and back in fixed it and that is fine. Look the tech is competent enough he just has a huge issue with a failure to keep his tickets closed.  

&gt; $Me - So... 

&gt; $C2 - Wait there is one more for this ticket. On the 22nd of March the user reopened the ticket stating she forgot to change her password and needed help. By the time the tech got to it she had already called the hotline and got it taken care of with another tech. That sounds normal... However. There is a clear progression here of a failure to maintain the tech's ticket queue. There is a clear line of failure from start to finish of being able to keep this ticket closed.  

&gt; $Hit - So If I am understanding you correctly, the issue you want us to address is randomly reopening tickets on the user end?

&gt; $C1 - No. This is a clear failure to keep the tickets closed. *takes off his glasses* You have a real problem with techs failing to keep their tickets closed. 

&gt; $Me - So that phrase you just used. ""Failure to keep tickets closed."" It is a useless metric to track. You understand that right?

&gt; $c2 - I fail to see 

&gt; $Me - A rhetorical quesiton when its posed? I wasnt asking. I was telling you... in the form of a question. You see you both know that this is a useless metric to track. You know this. You had to dig to the bottom of the barrel to find a metric to try and let people go. 

I take a drink of water and look around the room. $hit is hiding a smile, $EVPIT is smirking on the side of his mouth, and $VPN has a huge grin on her face hidden behind her hands. 

&gt; $ME - If you had come to me directly with honest intentions I would have assisted you. I have 4 contractors out there who show up late every day, who have been given warning after warning, and one who I am going to let go no matter what when he gets in cause he cussed out a customer. That would have been 5 for your sacrificial chamber and 5 less headaches I have to deal with. Instead. I am going to give the other 4 a second chance. 

&gt; $C1 - *To EVPIT* He is throwing out some wild accusations here and I am formally asking you what you wish to do about this. 

&gt; $EVPIT - I stand behind $Me's decision and agree that you have picked a metric that... will not produce favorable results for the company. I feel like I have gained some very valuable information from this meeting. *Looks to me* Anything you wish to say regarding this?

&gt; $Me - No I think you covered it pretty well. I just wanted to add again that we have contractors who are on the final straw. Instead you went over experienced employees with tenure and experience.  We keep the low hanging fruit for a reason if you catch my meaning. 

&gt; $C1 - Just so you know our report will go to the CEO and CIO about this. I will personally recommend that the metric of Failing to keep tickets closed be tracked and personally recommend a shake up of the management staff. 

&gt; $Me - *points to the camera in the corner* OK. I will recommend he watch the video while reading your report.

The consultants filed out of the room and quickly left the building. 

&gt; $VPN - WHat a bunch of...

I will leave the story to let off there. There was zero fallout from this. The CEO did not care at all as apparently my dept was not the only department to tell off their consultants. The CIO laughed and said he owed me lunch for the laughs I gave him from the video, and I legitimately gave the four consecutively late people a final chance. The guy who cussed out a customer was not even let into the building. He was fired from the front door.",talesfromtechsupport,2543,1525881866
Fhtagnyatta,Wherein I must wait 11 minutes to say 23 important words.,"Ok fellow TFTSers, this just happened a few hours ago.

So our hosting service was forced to do an emergency maintenance, and all VPNs were going to be downed for about 2 hours, between 9am and 11am.

They called us at 8:30, making us aware of the situation and apologizing profusely. Additionally, they have a 5 minute window where they can push us up to a gig of our docs for the meantime.

Upper Management was having a monthly meeting, with the Office Manager giving an 'important' presentation about core values or synergy or some other time waster.

I know that most likely the OM had her docs stored remotely, so I put the host support on hold and call up to the conference room.

2 rings, then hangup. No voicemail.

Call again.

One ring, hangup, no voicemail.

So I page on the intercom 'OM please call the IT dept, this is important'.

2 minutes go by, no answer.

So now 3 minutes left and I run upstairs to the meeting room (the meeting isn't scheduled to go live for another 20 mins or so), and wave down the OM. I was planning to tell her: ""The VPN to our datastore is down, if you need any files We have a 5 minute window to get them for you.""

She angrily waves me away and keeps talking to the room.

I slide up next to the podium and this exchange occurs:

Fhtagnyatta: The VPN...

OM: Look, whatever it is it can wait, I'm giving a presentation.

Fhtagnyatta: The sched...

OM: We have a lot of ground to cover so we started early, if you interrupt me again that will be a verbal. Sit down and wait until we have a pause.

Fhtagnyatta: Fine...

So I get my stale donut and lukewarm coffee and sit.

And wait.

Synergy... core values... encapture... life branding...

And wait.

Eventually she goes to open her presentation, and lo and behold 'Server not found'.

She glares angrily at me and waves me up.

OM: What is going...

Fhtagnyatta: The VPN to our datastore is down, if you need any files We have (checks phone) a negative eight minute window to get them for you..

OM glares at me like I just stomped on a kitten.

She sent me away, and I'm scheduled to meet with the president later this afternoon.

I might be without a job because she wouldn't let me say 23 words.

Of course this is all my fault...",talesfromtechsupport,4037,1525808760
Universal_Binary,Never underestimate a system administrator that knows how to code. Sometimes they can accomplish things that VPs can't - and eliminate the Great Day of Printing,"**Me**: PFY (jr. systems administrator and support guy) in the Computer Science Department of a large university.  Just learning Perl, and looking for things to parse.

**Boss**: Sr. CS sysadmin, my boss, and effortless genius at solving bureaucratic and people problems.  Disliked the University ""bigwigs"", and bragged with a smile and a chuckle of his ""friends in low places"" all over campus, with whom he often managed to make good things happen despite idiocy from the top.

**UC**: University Computing, the keeper of central computing on campus, and in particular of the master class enrollment database.

**COFs**: Crusty Old Farts, the old COBOL guys in University Computing that maintained the enrollment database mainframe system.  Good-ole-boy buddies with the director of UC, who in turn was always shmoozing the president, VPs, etc. of the university, making the COFs unfireable.  They spent more effort avoiding work than doing it.  (The rest of UC was fine.)

**Scene**: The Great Day of Printing at the start of spring semester, about 20 years ago.

Each semester, on the momentous Great Day of Printing, UC would run a printout for every academic department, covering every class, listing every student that was enrolled.  These massive stacks of wide fanfold printouts would be assembled from the line printers in Central Printing and delivered to each department.  The departments would tear them at class boundaries and give them to the instructors.  Several rainforests were probably devastated by this.

The CS dept. had thousands of students taking hundreds of classes (or ""sections"" if a given class was offered at multiple times).  I always hated the start of a semester, because for several weeks, Boss and I were inundated with people having trouble logging in to the CS Unix systems.  Some of these were run-of-the-mill PEBKAC issues, but a good chunk boiled down to the stacks of paper from UC.

When various people are creating and deleting accounts for thousands of people from printouts, mistakes happen.  Boss and I spent many hours sorting them out each semester.

Boss hated it just as much as I did.  He had worked on the enrollment system years ago and knew there was a better way.  If we could just get that massive report for the CS dept. in a file, instead of a printout, we could write a screengrabber to log into the mainframe, display/download it, parse it, and automatically manage the thousands of accounts.  Boss knew this was easy.  Or, SHOULD be.

Over the course of a couple weeks talking to COFs, punctuated by ignored voicemails, etc, he had this conversation:

&gt; Boss: ... and so we'd like you to run the departmental report to a file instead of the printer.

&gt; COF: That's not possible.

&gt; Boss: Actually, it's easy.  You can do it in 5 minutes... [ explains it to COF ]

&gt; COF: Maybe, but uh, it's also against policy.

&gt; Boss: Against policy?

&gt; COF: You're not allowed to request that report.

&gt; Boss: But I already get that report.  On paper.

&gt; COF: Doesn't matter.  It's a security policy.  But there's a different report you could use.

&gt; Boss: Oh?

&gt; COF: Yes.  The per-class report.  It has the exact same output. &lt;smugly&gt;  All you have to do is put in a request for each class section.

COF said this with the attitude of ""this excuse has worked for me for 15 years.""  Because the way you run a report on this system is you telnet to it, go through multiple needlessly complicated screens to put in the request, and then wait for an operator to grab the job from the queue, input (hopefully accurately) the parameters into the program that actually runs the report, and then you wander on down to Central Printing to pick it up in a few days (or log back on to the system to see if you have a print dump waiting).  Only a very stupid person would do this hundreds of times, because it would take days.

... unless, that is, you have a green and keen PFY (me), freshly minted in the ways of Perl, eager to tackle a parsing and screenscraping job over summer.  So I worked up programs to telnet to the mainframe, automatically submit the hundreds of requests, download the results, and do the right thing to the Unix accounts.

**Finally fall semester arrived** and it was time to try out my code for real.

On the first day of class, in the space of about 2 minutes, UC's operators received several hundred requests for enrollment data from us.  They had to manually approve, run, and save the report for each one.  Since we automated and they didn't, that which took us 2 minutes took them all day.  And, for the first time in ages, we weren't dealing with so many account problems!

**One week later**: with a twinkle in his eye and a smile on his face, Boss says, ""We have a lot of people add or drop classes in the first few weeks.  We need to do this every week for the first month of class.""  Which was true.  So, off go several hundred more requests.

**Another week later**: Boss had an even bigger grin when he said, ""They've complained about me to the department chair!  He asked them if they would let us use the proper report yet.  They still said no.  Let's run the script again!""  Several hundred more requests sent out.

By spring semester, we had access to the proper report.

Boss's old friend, an insider in the trenches at University Computing (not a COF) later stopped by and said, ""Do you know how many high-up people in the university have asked for this for 10 years?  You're a sysadmin and you got what deans couldn't.""

Boss's reply: ""Never underestimate a system administrator that knows how to code.""

***

**Epilogue**: I only worked there a couple years, but Boss had become a good friend and mentor.  For more than 20 years, up until his last day on the job earlier this year, his desk was in the exact same spot it had always been.  Multiple reorganizations had happened, CS got meshed up with other departments, people were moved all over campus, and he even got transferred to a completely unrelated department.  On paper, anyway.  But somehow, somehow... he just...  didn't move.  He kept his office, right in the middle of the CS department that he loved.  He even managed to keep most of his CS job duties (which he also mostly enjoyed).  Even though he supposedly hadn't worked for them for over 10 years.

This is just one of many fond memories of The Boss.  I will miss dropping by every so often and having a good laugh about the old times.

UnshornDiergar,Spreadsheets: More powerful than you could possibly imagine.,"A while back, I was hired to do some editorial work.  This is different than IT support, because I know how to do editorial work, and have only a general understanding of IT.  On my first day there, one of the office staff was showing me how when I finished a job, I had to put it into their billing spreadsheet.  ""And if it's a client we don't have a record for, you should put in a new row, only make sure you get it in the right place alphabetically, because otherwise we're going to miss it.""

She was a nice lady who seemed competent, and it was literally my first day, so I figured I was probably missing something.  But I decided to go out on a limb, and ask why they weren't just sorting their spreadsheet by last name, rather than hand alphabetizing. 

It was like I had stolen fire from the gods and brought it down to their office.  Amazing!  It was going to make it so much easier for them to sort things properly!

At this point, I asked about the calculator that the lady had next to her computer.

""It's for the billing,"" she explained.  ""We put the amount we're charging for each job into the cells at the end of the line here, and then I have to add it up with the calculator to get the total amount we're billing them.""

I was a little afraid that her head would actually explode once she realized the potential in being able to add up columns right there in her spreadsheet without needing additional equipment.

Mostly I worked remotely, because that office was two hours away by transit.  But after I showed her how Excel could be of assistance in that task as well, I had so firmly established my reputation as a tech wizard that they'd call me in when they had other problems.  In order to overcome such technological difficulties as the printer not working (I cleared a paper jam) and the internet being down (I plugged the phone plug back into the jack) they paid me twenty dollars an hour to ride on trains.",talesfromtechsupport,2729,1525763213
cc452,"INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS have tried to fix this, kid. You can't.","Let me regal you with one of the times I applied the tech support mindset out in the wild, and fixed a problem 8 years in the making. TL;DR at the bottom.

Set your time machines to back when emo was still new, and if you were cool, you *had* to have a MySpace page. \(Man, that Top 8 caused a lot of drama...\)

I was in college, taking a class on practical film lighting. Every week, as a class, we'd have to go up another floor and each grab a giant lighting kit. These kits had a few different lamp types, along with stands, colour tint sheets, etc. Keep in mind, this was before LEDs were powerful and cheap enough, so all of these were old industrial incandescent bulbs that weighed a ton and were **hot**. Number #1 safety rule: If the light falls, DO NOT TRY AND CATCH IT. You'll lose a hand. Really.

In this story, I'm CC, and lighting prof is, well, $LightingProf.

During our first class, we're all sitting in the studio space. $LightingProf is giving us a lecture about lighting theory \(I knew it already and had stopped paying much attention after the safety briefing\). My wandering eyes look up, and notice a FULLY INSTALLED LIGHTING GRID. Around 50 lights, with a few different types, colour tints, and what looked to be motorized.

Cue raising of hand.

&gt;CC: ""Um, $Prof?""  
&gt;  
&gt;$LightingProf: ""Yes?""  
&gt;  
&gt;CC: *points upwards* ""Is that a full lighting grid?""  
&gt;  
&gt;$LightingProf: ""Yes, it is.""

30\+ students all look up, then down at the prof again. I know a few of them want to ask, but it's the first class. Prof doesn't volunteer any information. I sigh and raise my hand again.

&gt;CC: ""Could we use that instead of these lighting kits we keep having to bring down from A/V rental?""  
&gt;  
&gt;$LightingProf: ""Well, we could. But the lighting panel is buggy, so it doesn't really work. This way is easier.""

He then chuckles. This is funny, you see. I see where he's coming from, but now I'm curious. No, actually, now I'm ***curious***. \(Danger, Will Robinson!\)

Next class rolls around, we all grab our gear from the second floor \(many, many stairs\), have our next class. I'm itching to touch that lighting board. It's sitting right over there. But it's only the second class, and the opportunity just isn't there.

Third class. We all grab our gear. People are starting to loathe the class because of this. We show up. Prof isn't there. 20 minutes pass. Prof still isn't there. Some people leave, the rest start chatting amongst themselves. No one thinks to go ask the administration.

I see my chance.

I walk up to the lighting board. Turn it on. Start testing the sliders assigned for individual lights. Three lights go on. Then five. Then two. Then ten. Some overlap, but not all. And these are sliders meant for individual lights. They aren't by zone, or by colour. There's absolutely no logic to it.

A few students have drifted by, and offer suggestions. They're intrigued by how non\-sensical the board is being.

Then, prof shows up. He makes a beeline for our gathering around the board.

&gt;$LightingProf: ""**WHAT ARE YOU DOING?**""  
&gt;  
&gt;\*students scatter\*  
&gt;  
&gt;CC: ""Well, you said the lighting board was buggy. I wanted to see if I could fix it.""  
&gt;  
&gt;$LightinProf: ""Kid, we've got industry professionals on staff, and several of them have taken a look at it and can't fix it. You won't be able to.""

***Curiosity*** changes to ***Wanna bet?***

&gt;CC: ""Okay. Well, it's unusable now. Mind if I keep trying?""  
&gt;  
&gt;$LightingProf: ""Sure, whatever. It's your class time. If you miss any material, it's your fault.""

Which would have had more an impact if he hadn't shown up 45 minutes late into a 70 minute class. But I have my permission. And I'm angry in the way only an 18 year old can be at authority. Let's do this.

You see, I hadn't just bit hitting sliders and buttons randomly. I was testing. Methodically. This lighting board was programmable, and it seemed like someone had programmed a bunch of the sliders very strangely. \(These are called ""scenes"", or at least they are when done properly\) Or multiple people had done so. I could figure out what all the programmed scenes were \(what lights were with what, etcetera\), or...

The board had a small alphanumeric display and a menu button. I hit it.

**Enter 4\-digit code**.

There's no way the prof will give it to me, even if he knew it, which I seriously doubt. I think back to what I've read about schools, common passwords, etc. What's the number of this classroom? Yup, four digits. Right.

**Incorrect. Enter 4\-digit code.**

Shrug, plug the classroom number in reverse. Boom.

I cycle through the menus quickly, see a few interesting ones. Find the one about programmable scenes. Cycle through that. There are over 50. I nope out of that submenu. Keep cycling. Ah, here we go.

**Warning: This will reset your board to factory defaults. Proceed?**

Oh, hell yes.

The board clears, turns off, then on again. The sliders all come go down of their own accord \(they were also motorized, had no idea\). Each of the grid lights then fades up and down once as the board tests. Students are now looking up and around, and the prof is looking straight at me with suspicion. I'm just \(literally\) watching the light show.

The lights finish cycling through their test and turn off. I look back at the board, it looks at me, innocent as you please. I bring up fader #1. Light #1 comes up. Fade #2. Light #2 comes up. I do the same for the next 5. They all come up individually.

The class has broken down into badly whispered gossiping. Prof comes over.

&gt;$LightingProf: ""You got it working. Go sit down.""  
&gt;  
&gt;CC: ""No. I haven't tested all of the lights, yet. I don't know if it's *really* working.""  
&gt;  
&gt;$LightingProf: \*grumbles and goes back to the gaggle of students\*

For the next twenty minutes, I painstakingly \(ie way slower than needed\) test every single light. I made sure to test some of them multiple times, just to make sure. The fact that they were the ones pointed at prof \(nothing directly in his eyes\) was a pure coincidence. Honest. The students had a really hard time concentrating on his lecture as pot lights kept coming on and off, shining off his shiny shaved head. Finally, I pushed my testing as much as I thought I could and joined the rest of the class.

Oh, but dear reader, we're not done.

Later in the day, I'm in another class, when three different $FilmDepartment professors burst into my $CompSci lab in the middle of a lecture. They go right to the $CompSci prof, in what looks like a panic.

&gt;$FilmProf2: ""Is CC in this class? Which one is he?""  
&gt;  
&gt;$CompSciProf: ""Uh, yes? He's over there.""

All three \(none of them are the original lighting prof from above\) rush over.

&gt;$FilmProf2: ""Did you fix the lighting board in $Room?""  
&gt;  
&gt;CC: ""Uh, yeah. I just reset it to factory defaults.""  
&gt;  
&gt;All three of their faces go white.  
&gt;  
&gt;$FilmProf3: ""What? Why didn't anyone think of that?""  
&gt;  
&gt;$FilmProf1: ""I can't believe it. Thank you!""  
&gt;  
&gt;$FilmProf2: ""That was really smart. I'm glad you worked with $LightingProf to get that working.""  
&gt;  
&gt;CC: ""Oh, I didn't. That was on my own. He didn't want me touching it, and got angry when I fixed it.""  
&gt;  
&gt;$FilmProf2: ""...I see. Well, thank you.""

They left. $CompSci prof looked at me for an explanation, I just shrugged, class continued.

Next lighting class, we were told we didn't have to check out lighting kits anymore and ""they"" \(the staff\) had fixed the lighting board, so we'd be using that going forward. Cue grateful sighs from the class, and dirty looks to the prof from everyone, as they knew exactly who had fixed it, and it wasn't staff.

$LightingProf spent the rest of the semester refusing to look at me and giving me the passive aggressive treatment. I gave absolutely no f\*\*\*s.

**TL;DR:** I fixed a lighting board that had been broken for 8 years by walking over, guessing the admin code and hitting *Reset to Factory Default*, while my professor looked on in ever\-increasing impotent rage. It was glorious.",talesfromtechsupport,4703,1525704897
lord_kelly,Whenever I do this thing my website breaks!,"So I work for a web development company and we have a fair few clients. This client in question, however, is one of our higher-maintenance clients, still very lovely of course but they  require a lot of running around after with a fire extinguisher.

We actually didn't build their site, they came to us asking for help because their previous developers dropped support for them, goodness knows why!

A lot of stuff is wrong with it but they have a limited budget so we can't fix it all at once, even though we're getting through a lot of the issues, some still remain, so without further ado, on with the tale!

&gt; Client on the phone: Hello the site is down please can you fix it immediately?

&gt; Me: of course, what's the error?

&gt; Client: it's just a blank page


I log onto the server and notice that the site isn't down 

&gt; Me: it seems fine from here, what page are you trying to view?

&gt; Client: I'll email you the link...

I get the link and notice that the page is indeed broken, and it's being caused by a null reference exception.

The way this page works, is it takes several images from children pages and displays them. If you don't want an image to show, you need to go onto the child page and remove the image there. This client has developed a lovely habit of going to the media library and removing the images from there which doesn't update the content pages, and because the image doesn't exist anymore, a null reference exception occurs!

I explain this on the phone to our client.

&gt;Client: well is there no way to solve this?

&gt;Me: yes you need to go to the child page first and remove the image there before deleting it from the media library

&gt;Client: that seems stupid, it should automatically know when I delete it and do it for me

&gt;Me: yeah that would be useful! I'll see if we can schedule some time in to work on a tool that does that for you, I reckon it'll be about two or three days of work though, should I start planning?

&gt;Client: oh no that's far too long, we can't afford that, but the system should do it automatically

&gt;Me [internally]: well too bad, it doesn't so what now?

We explain to our client that they must must must remove the images from the child pages before removing them from the media library on the phone and in a follow up email.

The next day the client phones up with the same issue and we go through the same steps to explain the problem and the workaround.

Then the next week, the client calls with the SAME issue! The same diagnostics occur and the same brief is given to the client.

Then three more times over the next month, each time we're told the cost to implement a fix is too great and that the system should just do it.

And now I've just finished fixing the issue again and came here to write this! Soon there'll be a palm-shaped indentation in my forehead! 

We don't charge to fix this as all the client has to do is get the image back out of the recycle bin, but it's just really funny how often this happens when they have been told a hundred times how to avoid it!

Hope my formatting is alright and I hope you all enjoy the story :)",talesfromtechsupport,781,1525695218
MjolnirVIII,Why am I even an IT for your company?,"So this literally just happened now and I'm still steaming after getting back from a meeting with the boss.

Some guy from ISP A came over selling their internet \+ phone package to our company. Definitely way better than what ISP B currently gives us. 10x the speed, cheaper phone lines, retain the same numbers, and and direct rather than VoIP, and we save 30$ or something per month, which is pretty big for a small business.

Boss asks me about the VoIP to direct, asking how the current system is. See, a few months back, the Modem/Router combo that ISP B gave us died on us and the internet and phone lines were out of commission. Internet was easily fixed by using the company cellphone as a hotspot, but the phones were really dead, and customer support was being a bitch.  

So ISP A is offering direct, meaning that if the modem/router dies, it doesn't necessarily mean that the phones will be dead too.  I explain it to my boss how it works and the conversation went something like this:

Boss: So what makes ISP B's phone line different?

Me: If the modem/router dies, the phone won't. 

Boss: Wasn't it always like that?

Me: No, cuz it was connected to the same box. So if your modem/router goes down, your phones are down too. 

*\-and here comes the clincher\-*

Boss: **I don't think so.** 

...

So boss asks the other employees who are non\-IT and they agree with me saying that that's how the system works, AND BOSS BELIEVES THEM!

It's ALWAYS been like this too. Even when the modem/router was down before. I told her the modem/router box is dead cuz no wifi signal, etc etc. Boss just says ""No you just misplugged something or maybe didn't set an option right"" and in my mind I'm just like ""BITCH I TOOK A PHOTO BEFORE I UNPLUGGED ANYTHING. IT'S ALL THE SAME.""

ugh....why did she even hire an IT only to second\-guess the IT. ",talesfromtechsupport,1335,1525471836
wrestleholic_jericho,This is my life. YOU MUST GRANT ACCESS!,"One of my current job functions is helping to manage the proxy servers, including adding exceptions if say a client's website is registering a false positive and is being blocked. Whenever users are in the web browser, if a page is blocked there's a link to a form to request proxy access to the URL, and of course there's room for a business reason/justification. Most of the time, these are websites for new customers that may have a low reputation since they are new, and again we'll often grant access if it's truly another business being blocked.

Once in a while, though, we get some real gems, including the usual ""I need this YouTube access for learning,"" in which case we may grant access to individual videos if it's legitimate training. Yesterday, I received my favorite proxy request and I have considered printing out the email and framing it on my cube, and this is actually the second request from this user so let's start from the first request:

     Business reason: JW.tv and JW.org- is my religious institute. I use the platform to enhance my theocratic studies and for moral stability. It is not for entertainment. This is my way of life.

We send out the email that this request is denied because it is not business related. My current employer does have a strict policy on what is accessed on the network, nobody said you can't watch it on your phone since users don't get the company Wi-Fi either. Our response:

&gt; $IT: Due to corporate policy, this request has been denied. Proxy exceptions must be business related, and the business reason listed does not match our policies and standards. Thank you.

A month later, we received what is my favorite proxy request to date, and it's even more satisfying because we simply copy and pasted our generic response to it, but...well you'll see:

     Business reason: This is my religion, my life.  I LOOK ON THIS SITE FOR MORAL STABILITY. NOT FOR PLEASURE. YOU CAN LOOK AT IT. IT WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTION YOU HAVE IN LIFE.

I wanted to tell them that it apparently won't answer the question of why your request is being denied again, but I like keeping my job intact. Just wanted to share with you all one of my favorite business reasons ever given for access to a website.",talesfromtechsupport,1649,1525447270
fatherfatpants,What do you mean it’s all gone?,"A quick story from my father years ago. 


He had just got done installing $proprietarysoftware that ran off of a server/dumb terminal setup at a hospital.  So my dad gets the terminals up, users are starting to test, then suddenly everything goes wiggly then dead.


Turns out that 3 floors down they were having the opening ceremony for this brand new thing called an MRI scanner.  MRI’s and their interaction with tech hadn’t been fully studied by the hospital when they had done the install so the room wasn’t properly shielded. I think it was a year before they could use the machine. The MRI managed to wipe or damage all of the drives (those big washing-machine units of years past) as well as smoke half of the terminals.


The hospital management was at least sheepish about the whole event and did pay for a reinstall.",talesfromtechsupport,971,1525431907
Cgdoosi,Let's perform a system update in an airport,"Had a customer bring in an Apple laptop today.

They had been putting off updating their OS to High Sierra for a few months and they were waiting at the airport to get on a flight. So they decided to download and install the update over the airport's free WiFi.

With that news all the staff who overheard gave a collective wince. Full system updates are a delicate task at the best of times, but downloading it over a free airport hotspot... not a good idea.

The update had apparently downloaded fine and the system had restarted to apply the update. The amount of time they must have spent downloading a 2-3GB update must have been a long layover, but if it downloaded fine, there might have been hope.

But then they got the call for their flight and instead of closing the unit and putting into sleep, which may have been ok, they powered it off with the power button.

Now that would be bad at the best of times, however the latest macOS has a new file system for flash storage, of which all current laptops have. Updating to that new OS means that the whole partition has to be converted from the previous file system to the new one. This apparently happens at the same time as the new system files are written as well, which is why the laptop fails to boot after updating 1 in 10 even at the best of times.

After explaining why each of her decisions probably wasn't the best choice. Thankfully she was happy enough to book it in for us to take a look at whether any information is going to be recoverable, then fix the thing. Unfortunately half failed updates need reformatting the partition if it's caught halfway in one files system and half in the other, so I'm not looking forward to the results.",talesfromtechsupport,2132,1525413733
MalletNGrease,Computer gnomes,"My wife went into labor last weekend to deliver our firstborn. It wasn’t a fun experience, but not an awful one either. 

After the duty nurse confirmed that the day had indeed arrived, we were moved from the observation room to one of the delivery rooms along with a pair of nurses who were assigned to look after mom and the baby (and dad too!).

The new room had a workstation that had an issue. It did not want to wake from sleep or had locked up. Fans on, but no input response, no activity LED, no keyboard indicators or mouse optics, just the power led. The nurses pressed some buttons, gave up and left to get a spare.

My wife was pretty much exhausted from the contractions and out of it. I was now left alone with a piece of equipment that was interfering with my wife's care, so as a technical support professional decided to take matters into my own hand.

A quick diagnosis showed I was right and the usual remedies did not appear to work. I forced an unexpected reboot by removing the power lead, waited 10 seconds, then reinserted. The machine booted and proceeded to load as normal. I took my seat by my wife again.

When the nurses returned they were a bit befuddled at the now functioning machine. They asked me what happened.

""It came on right about when you came back. Must be computer gnomes"".

Mom and baby are healthy!

Universal_Binary,An angry professor and his coffee-damaged laptop gave me enlightenment (and laughs),"**Me**:  The green and keen PFY (jr. sysadmin/support person) in the Computer Science dept. at a large state university, a couple decades ago.  My first real job!

**Prof**: The one rude and surly professor in a department otherwise full of wonderful people.  Ph. D. in computer science, but known for printing out his emails before reading them.  Had two moods: yelling, and yelling loudly.

**Boss**: Sr. sysadmin, my boss, and effortless genius at solving bureaucratic and people problems.  Unflappably polite, but also didn't take crap from Prof.

**Scene**: The CS lab.  I was hard at work on something or other when Prof burst in.  (He never just entered quietly.  He always burst in without any pleasantries and left with a &lt;SLAM&gt; of the door.)

Boss was respectful to Prof, but didn't take crap from him.  So naturally when Prof wanted to yell and badger at someone, I, being the PFY, was an easier target.  This particular incident occurred about a week after he had used some grant money to buy the fanciest, most expensive laptop anyone in the department had ever seen, which he used for the arduous tasks of running notepad and printing emails.

&gt; Prof, yelling: This laptop is broken.  I demand that you fix it immediately.

&gt; Me: Hmmm...  Let me take a look....  Looks like you spilled coffee all over the keyboard.

&gt; Prof, yelling LOUDLY: That is a ridiculous accusation!  I resent that!  I never drink coffee near the laptop!  I'm a professor.  Don't talk to me like that!  I'm telling Boss how rude you were.

I wasn't super worried.  Boss knew this guy.  And how often his printed-out emails had coffee stains on them.  I looked closer and, before thinking, blurted out -

&gt; Me: ... and cream, it would seem?

Prof finds Boss, calls him over, and angrily escalates to Boss in my presence.

&gt; Prof: ... and so I demand you fix it immediately.

&gt; Boss: It doesn't even power up.  We can't fix that.  It'll have to go back to Gateway.

&gt; Prof: It's under warranty.  Make them fix it!

Boss lets him dig the hole nice and deep.

&gt; Boss: Warranty won't cover a coffee spill.

&gt; Prof: IT WASN'T A COFFEE SPILL!  I DEMAND A WARRANTY REPAIR! IMMEDIATELY! AND WE WON'T PAY ONE CENT FOR IT!  &lt;SLAM&gt;

Exit prof.  Now I am a green and keen PFY.  What would Lassie do now?

&gt; Me: What on earth do we do here?

Boss gets a sly smile.

&gt; Boss: Ship it in for a warranty repair like he asked.

&gt; Me: But won't they just reject it?

&gt; Boss: Of course.

&gt; Me: But....   ooohhhhhhhh!

Boss's smile deepens.

&gt; Boss: And make sure to document for them that we refuse to pay even one cent for repair, just as Prof said.

And so begins my enlightenment.

Off goes the laptop.  Prof stops by every day for the next week or two, asking if the laptop's back, if we've heard anything, etc.  I'm sure the pain of having to print his email from a mere *average* computer was really getting to him.

Finally we get a package back from Gateway.  I was about to open it, but boss says no.  He calls up Prof to tell him his laptop is back.  Prof, of course, rushes over immediately.

&gt; Prof: &lt;bursts in&gt;  So it's back?  Does it work?

&gt; Boss: Here it is.  We haven't opened it yet.

Prof almost looks excited as he opens the box.  There's the laptop, with a repair order on top, reading:

&gt; Warranty claim denied

&gt; Rejection reason: System board damaged by dried brown and white liquid and smells of burnt coffee.

It also, to add ~~insult to injury~~hilarity, included a bill for the return shipping fee.

Prof stood there staring.  He literally got red in the face.  He yelled some more.  Loudly.  Boss and I just sat there, trying hard not to grin too obviously.  Finally:

&gt; Prof: Well how do I get it fixed then?

&gt; Boss: Pay for the repair.

&gt; Prof: Oh all right then, send it back.

Prof then looked at each of us intently, in an almost threatening manner.

&gt; Prof: But it wasn't coffee!  Got that?  IT WASN'T COFFEE! &lt;SLAM&gt;",talesfromtechsupport,3225,1525353313

Anyways, I get an email that some 2FA system is down from User A. I explain to User A that it is SU (super user) job to setup the 2FA. He sends that to SU, who promptly sends back an email saying “IT needs to have this fixed before any new deployments go out”. I calmly explain to SU that it’s a setting on her backend, and that IT doesn’t deal in 2FA for this system (it’s housed outside of our network).

She then CC’s my boss, her boss, and User A explaining how she doesn’t have the option to do this, and that IT better figure it out soon because it’s a security risk. This is where I lost it. 

I pick up the phone dial the software support agents. They explain to me exactly what I told SU. I ask for an email with the support ticket information.

curtludwig,Being lazy gets you the most work,"There was a time when I was working phone support when my boss mouthed off to a customer and somehow managed to not get fired. His punishment was that he could no longer speak to customers. This meant that I became the defacto boss for my group.

One of the techs that worked ""for me"" in this defacto role had the same name as 3 of the other guys in the office.

&gt; Me: Well we can't have another guy with the same name, I'll call you... Stinky.


&gt; New guy: Oh geez, don't call me that. At my last job they called me *Hilarious nickname* and it really stuck.

&gt; Me: Well *Hilarious nickname*, I think you're going to love it here.

*Hilarious nickname* was a pretty good tech, he had previously worked for *big cable provider* and as people were much less likely to yell at him working with us he was pretty chill.

After a couple months I noticed that *Hilarious nickname* was taking a lot more calls than the other 2 members of his team. This didn't make sense as I could recognize the laziness in *Hilarious nickname* as similar to the lazy streak in myself and the other 2 guys on his team were both type A personalities and very hard workers.

As I set to digging I realized *Hilarious nickname's* mistake, after every call he'd set himself to ""unavailable"" in the phone system. Normally ""unavailable"" was what you'd use if you needed a bathroom or lunch break, ""followup"" was the appropriate setting if you had finished a call and needed to tidy up your notes.

It turns out that *Hilarious nickname* thought by going ""unavailable"" after every call he wouldn't get penalized for taking a little break after every call but what really happened was that when he set himself ""available"" again he would be put at the top of the phone tree and automatically take the next call and so was unwittingly sniping calls from the other two techs.

Years later I was talking to a woman I worked with at a different company and she mentioned ""oh my friend from college says he knows you."" she told me the name but it wasn't anybody I recognized. Later that day I got an email from *Hilarious nickname*

starla79,In which we discover a locked account has more than one meaning...,"I'm not a true tech support person, but being the security person in charge of the logs, I spend a lot of time working with tech support to troubleshoot issues.  

One of those issues, one that plagued our organization for a time, was account lockouts.  The powers that be decided to reduce our failed login threshold, which was good, in that it was more secure, but was bad, in that our wireless ISE system was proficient in generating login failures any time a user moved from access point to access point.  This caused people to get locked out when they had effectively done nothing wrong. People would even get locked out after logging into their computers, leading into all sorts of trouble with email and other things.  Eventually they backed off on the threshold while we tried to find a way to make ISE stop generating the failures, but we still had a lot more lockouts than normal to deal with.  Usually, it was the user having the wrong wifi password in their phone, or running a script with their old credentials after changing their password, but every once in a while we had something... or someone... special.

To facilitate troubleshooting persistent lockouts, I had created a couple of queries in our logging system that tech support could use for troubleshooting, but inevitably i was called to assist pretty much every time.  TS will be tech support, Me is yours truly and *this* is everything going through my head.

&gt;TS: ""This user keeps getting locked out, Joe Tech unlocked her account several times this morning but it keeps happening.  We can't figure out why.""

*Okay, I'll play your game.  I pull up my query and filter for her username.  No lockouts.*

&gt;Me: ""Sorry bud, her account isn't getting locked out.  Why is Joe Tech unlocking her account when it's not locked?  You can see that in AD when you look at the account, it tells you right there if it's locked out."" 

*If a tree falls in an active directory forest but no one's around to unlock it, does the user still make a sound?*

&gt;TS: ""But she keeps saying it's locked and we don't know what else to do.""

*Of course.  Keep unlocking it even though it's clear from the logs and from AD that her account is not in fact locked out. Isn't that the definition of insanity...*

&gt;Me: ""You do realize that's the definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result?""

&gt;TS: ""Yeah, but can you fix it?""

&gt;Me: ""This is beyond my ability to troubleshoot remotely and it's not ISE.  She's not getting locked out.  Next time she calls saying it's locked, send someone over to look at the error message, since she obviously can't take a screenshot and email it at that point.""

TS: ""Will do.""

Excellent.  Now we wait.

User: No, this is the photo.  Can you scroll up a bit?

Tech: As I mentioned, this is the top of the photo, there's nothing more to scroll up.

User: No, there is.  You know like how on Google Maps, you can view all around.  How can we do that here?

Universal_Binary,Only $25k for a server? Let's get the $100k version - it's bound to be more reliable! If only we knew how to use it...,"Scene: I was working in IT in the early 2000s.  I had cleaned up the company's core network (getting rid of the 10Mb **hubs**) and now the company realized it was time to tackle the big enchilada: the ERP system.  

**The setup, in which stupid decisions are made**

This system was critical.  Through it ran all the company's financials, HR, shipping, parts processing, etc.  And I promise I am not making this up: it quite literally ran on a system that was the size of a washer/dryer set and was so old it didn't even support ASCII.  A steady parade of tech (well, ONE tech that still understood it) came by to service the line printer, the tape drive, etc.  

A committee for evaluating replacements was formed.  After sitting through presentations by various sleazy ERP salespeople, a product was duly chosen.  As ""luck"" would have it, the consultants that sold and installed $PRODUCT also sold and installed hardware.  And the company's hardware they sold: IBM.

$CONSULTANTS duly produced a quote for a $25,000 server.  It was nothing special, a regular rackmount job with RAID.  The sort of thing that one would have gotten for $10,000 or less from Dell or HP.  It was going to run Linux.  I knew Linux, but thought we were getting ripped off.  Cue conversation at a committee meeting which somehow I managed to attend:

&gt; Me: I'm concerned about the price.

&gt; $Manager: I know.  Can you really get quality for only $25,000?

&gt; $VP: Right!  Our last server cost over $200,000!

&gt; Me: We could have the same for $10,000.

Consultant sees his boat going down the toilet and gives me the evil eye.

&gt; $Manager: What if we got two?  Then we'd have a backup.

Consultant starts to look excited.

&gt; $VP: That's still only $50,000.  Are we sure we're not buying something so cheap it's dodgy?

Consultant starts to look VERY excited.

&gt; $Consultant: You know, we're an IBM reseller.  We could sell you an AIX box.  It's like what you're used to.

Consultants duly provide a quote.  The clearly put everything they possibly could into it, plus a generous profit margin.  $80,000.  Managers are STILL concerned that it's too cheap.  So they add a separate ""disk expansion shelf"" (read: proprietary JBOD) to bring it up to $100,000.

&gt; Me: Nobody here knows AIX.

&gt; $Consultant: You're good with Linux.  We'll train you.  For free even!

&gt; $VP: That's a great deal!  Where do we sign?

Which would have been fine, if $Consultants actually had anyone that knew AIX.

**The plot thickens**

The AIX equipment duly arrives, followed by a consultant to do the install.  This isn't the salesguy consultant, this is the nerdy consultant.  I'll call him FreshPrince because he was always talking about his favorite TV show, the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, only FreshPrince was the opposite of Will Smith.  In EVERY way.

Of course, by this point, management is nowhere to be seen so it's FreshPrince and me.

&gt; FreshPrince: So I'll just install this then.

&gt; Me: Great.

I busy myself with the tasks of the day.  FreshPrince makes grunting noises as he struggles with the latch on the rack door, the rails, the server, the power, the install CD-ROM...   After much effort, and a few calls to tech support, he seems to have managed to configure something or other.

&gt; FreshPrince: I'm all done.

&gt; Me: You haven't asked me about the printer setup.  $Application needs printer access.

&gt; FreshPrince: Oh!  Uh.  Right.  So, uh, tell me about these printers?

I give him some information.  Correct, even.

Muttering ensues.  For hours.

&gt; Me: So how's it coming?

&gt; FreshPrince: Would you believe it, they redid how they do printers in AIX 5!  On AIX 4, it was, uh, somewhere else, and you have 5.  I can't even find where it is in the menu!  Hahaha!

&gt; Me: You've spent all afternoon not configuring the printers?

&gt; FreshPrince: Oh don't worry, I've got a hotel room, I'll be back tomorrow!

Hilarious...

**The amber lamp of doom**

Eventually I -- not FreshPrince -- set up the printers, the application is duly installed, migrations occur, rejoicing happens, consultants leave, more rejoicing happens, etc.

Then one day, the amber lamp of doom shows up on the system.  WTF is this?   Through various phone calls and twisty little menus, all alike (shoutout to smitty for any AIXers out there), we arrive at the conclusion: a disk in the RAID has failed.  (For about the 20th time that week, I was again thinking ""this would have been so much simpler on a $10k Linux box"")  IBM duly dispatches an engineer with a hard drive.

Engineer arrives.

&gt; Engineer: Which drive is bad?

&gt; Me: Heck if I know.  It took me two hours just to find out that the problem is a bad drive.

&gt; Engineer: I can't replace the drive unless I know which one.

&gt; Me: I was sorta hoping you could figure that out since you're from, you know, the people that made this thing.

&gt; Engineer: That's not my job, but as a favor to you, I'll see what I can do.

Engineer calls support.  An hour-long conversation involving many more twisty little menus ensued, while I eavesdropped and took notes for the future.  Eventually the defective drive was identified and replaced.

&gt; Engineer: All done.  Sign here.

&gt; Me: The amber light's still on.

&gt; Engineer: It's supposed to do that.

I HATE IT when they say that.

&gt; Me: That light was never on until the drive failed.

&gt; Engineer: I know.  You have to reset the lamp.

&gt; Me: How?

&gt; Engineer: I don't know.  Sign here.

&gt; Me: Also, there's no activity on the new drive.

&gt; Engineer: You have to trigger a RAID rebuild.

&gt; Me: I hesitate to ask, but... how?

&gt; Engineer: I don't know.  Sign here.

Multiple escalations occur at this point, since nobody in AIX support has any idea how to repair a degraded RAID.  Eventually, some hours later, the magic smitty incantation is produced, the RAID is rebuilt, and the Amber Lamp of Doom extinguishes.

**Epilogue**

2 years later, I managed to convince management to let me build a $10k Linux box.  User complaints were way down after that because it was much faster and -- yes -- more reliable.

&gt; $Manager: Wow, technology is so amazing!  Two years ago, we had to pay 10 times as much for this!

ITSupportZombie,Tales from Aircraft Maintenance: Code Brown,"Many years ago, I was an Air Force avionics technician. I had some very interesting experiences while in uniform, some of them I can even share with all of you.

It was a beautiful warm day, the moose calls of C\-17’s refueling could be heard all across post. I was relaxing on an especially long refuel when a call on the radio interrupted my wandering mind, thinking of all the places that I could be that aren’t here. An In\-Flight\-Emergency \(IFE\) was called. No details, just that the emergency was called. All refuel operations were stopped along with all non\-essential activities. With this call, everyone on shift and several of the guys coming on shift that were at work scramble an emergency tow crew and response team, orders are being shouted on the radio directing people for recovery.

With the bird on approach, we get another call. Medical emergency. This is bad. Potentially really bad.

The jet lands and taxies normally. As it parks on the spot we swarm the jet ready to respond to any emergency.

I walk onto the jet and catch a horrible smell. Like fermented death and curry. As I climb up to the flight deck \(don’t ever call it a COCKpit\), the smell gets worse. Once I was standing behind the pilot’s seat, I think I am going to be sick. The pilot, copilot, the relief pilot and one of the loadmasters have all “soiled” themselves uncontrollably and repeatedly on a 6 hour flight.

They also had a widespread electrical issue that was the cause of the IFE. Two twelve hour shifts later in an unimaginable stench, we discovered a failing circuit breaker was the cause of intermittent partial power loss.",talesfromtechsupport,893,1525184680

Last week it came time to replace her computer (that was already old when assigned) for a newer one. Setup of new CSR machines are pretty simple since they basically use only 2 programs: One is their phone application that connects to our call service, and the other is chrome. Everything else (including email) is accessed online.

&gt; $me: Just to double check, are there any other programs you need on your new machine?

&gt; $CSR: I don't know how to install anything so I only need what you guys put on the last one

&gt; $me: And you have all the information and documents you need saved to google drive?

&gt;$CSR: I have some things saved in my email - am I going to have to set up a new email account?

&gt;$me: No that's fine, once you log into your email on the new computer everything will still be there for you.

I proceed to setup the new machine for her, she comes in today after the weekend to pick it up and drop off the old one.

&gt; $me: Do you want to hang out and check to make sure I got everything set up correctly for you? That way if there is an issue I can fix it for you right now?

&gt;$CSR: No, I'm parked illegally so I shouldn't stay long! I'm sure it's all fine! Bye!

Of course two hours later I get a call from her:

&gt;$CSR: I thought you said you set up the computer for me! None of my information is on here!

&gt; $me: Remember you saved all of your information to your google drive? You'll just need to open chrome, log in, and it will all be exactly the same way you had it.

&gt;$CSR: But I don't know my login information! I had it saved in my email but I can't find the email on this computer.

&gt;$me: *(not sure why she has her login info stored in her email but leaving that alone for the time being)* Okay, well then you can just go to [emailserver].com and login and you'll have access to your emails just like before.

&gt;$CSR: No, no, no, I mean I can't find the email on the computer itself. I always used the computer's email not the internet's email - it never had me login so I don't know how to do that!

We do give our employees the freedom to use couple different email clients if they choose via POP3/IMAP but that was far beyond what this particular user could have figured out.

&gt;$me: Okay, do you mean you were using outlook before? Did someone set that up for you when we gave you the old machine?

&gt;$CSR: I don't know - my brother was in town when I started so I just gave the computer to him to figure out and he showed me which buttons to click.

&gt;$me: *eyeroll* Okay, sorry about that, you didn't mention that you needed that program.

tan_iel,The moment that elevated mum from $user to $admin,"Hey TFTS. LTL;FTP.


Like most of you here, I too have parents whom are largely tech-illiterate. but over the last two years, I've been making a conscious effort to get my parents (especially mum) to understand computers better. 


I'm a big believer of the ol' *give a man a fish, and you'll feed him for a day, teach him how to fish, and he can have food for life* mentality. So rather than showing mum how to resolve her every problem, we go through a process of:


* *what do you think is wrong?* 
* and *how are you going to solve it?*



Now admittedly, things do get incredibly frustrating in this process, and it can often take ~1/2 hour up to 1 hour to resolve issues. **BUT**, it has slowly been working.



So today, mum came to me with a problem, and as usual, seemed to blow it way out of proportion.



&gt; $mum: My phone is broken.

&gt; $me: What do you mean?

&gt; $mum: The camera doesn't work.

&gt; $me: What do you mean exactly?

&gt; $mum: When I go to the camera app, it says *connection cannot be establised*

&gt; $me: So have you tried anything to resolve it? (*insert smirky face*)

&gt; $mum: I turned it off and on again. But that didn't work.. 

&gt; $me: uh huh.

&gt; $mum: So then I booted the phone into recovery mode. 

&gt; $me: (*queue disbelief*)

&gt; $mum: And then I wiped the cache partition.

&gt; $me: (*sustained disbelief*)

&gt; $mum: But when I rebooted the phone, it still didn't work. So I thought the problem might be larger than that. 

&gt; $me: ... 

&gt; $mum: So I went onto several forums, and a lot of other people describing similar problems said it turned out to be a hardware fault.

&gt; $me: How the hell did you know how to do that? 

&gt; $mum: I googled it. 

&gt; $me: (*queue jaw drop*) So..I guess your phone is broken.

&gt; $mum: Yeah. That's what I told you in the beginning.

kamikageyami,"""I know I'm doing it right, I'm not stupid..""","So, I work in a large warehouse for a logistics company on the admin team. One small but regular part of my job is sorting out issues the warehouse floor workers get with the equipment that they use to scan products that are going to be shipped out.  

For some products, you have to first scan the barcode on the box as usual, then enter a number on the numpad, and then scan it again because the weight of that particular box needs to be recorded in our system so we know how much to charge the customer. This is the cause of a super common issue with new employees because they always scan the wrong barcode the second time and get an error message on their screen, which sends them running to me.  

It's a really easy fix, and 90% of the guys that encounter the problem get the idea after the first time and don't do it again, but last week I had a guy get stuck on this over and over again, coming back to me every two minutes to get it fixed insisting he was scanning the correct barcode. Usually I can sort this out without having to leave the office so I'd normally be a little annoyed, but I wasn't that busy at the time and I wanted to be fair and see if maybe it was just a weird problem with that particular scanner he was using. He seemed competent enough and shit happens, you know?  

So I walk out with him to his pallet where the boxes were, take a quick look to make sure they're the right product. (Sometimes a product will get put into the wrong spot in the warehouse) Everything seems fine, so I ask him to scan them again just so I can maybe see what's going on.
He assures me again that he's doing it right, so he kneels down and starts scanning the barcodes.  
I stand there in disbelief watching him scan a dozen or so boxes. He scans the barcode on the first box, types on the numpad, then scans it again (the wrong barcode). Immediately an error message pops up on the screen covering the UI:  
&gt;**""ERROR: UNKNOWN VALUE ENTERED""**  

...but this noble error message is not enough to stop him, he just keeps on scanning boxes. He doesn't even close the error message, so nothing he is doing is actually coming up on the screen, he's just going at it like it wasn't even there.  
  
I really didn't even know where to start.. sure, I'd encountered people who just click straight through error messages without reading them before, but this was a different kind of beast. Continuing the motion of using the screen as though there wasn't a huge error message waiting for confirmation sitting there, preventing any other input..    
Eventually I came back to my senses, pointed out which barcode he needed to scan and sent him on his way. I walked back to the office trying to find some meaning.. some logic to it.. but some things just aren't meant to be understood by mortal men.",talesfromtechsupport,622,1524951591
Malkron,Password Complexity Requirements,"I work remote first level tech support for the employees of a large company. Everything from password resets to network outages to Fitbit troubleshooting is in my wheelhouse.

When I drove to work today, I did not know that I was a couple hours away from putting my job at risk.

It was the second call of the day. Run of the mill password reset. This guy's password was expired, and I could tell from our brief conversation so far that he was not good with computers. That's fine. I used to teach an A+ course, so I am very comfortable talking tech with laymen.

After obtaining remote access to his machine, I went about resetting his password, and came to the fateful change password screen.

This screen is the bane of my existence sometimes. The company I support has a laundry list of password complexity requirements, and some of their employees take 15 minutes of hand-holding to get it right. Not this user, though. This user was *unique*. I had vastly overestimated his abilities.

20 minutes later, and I'm at wit's end. I have explained the requirements multiple times. I have asked him to write the password down on paper, and went line by line with the requirements, asking him if his password met each one. He said it did. I could not figure out what the problem was.

I had no choice but to breach security. I had to see what this guy was typing. We only do this when all else fails. It's a last ditch effort before investigating if there is a problem in the domain. 

I looked at his password. It started with the number 5 followed by a sufficient number of lowercase letters and a symbol. I told him that the password looked fine, except that it didn't have an uppercase letter.

What this guy said next would drastically lower the bar for the stupidest thing anyone has ever said to me.

""But...the number 5 is capital""

I almost broke the sound barrier with the quickness at which I hit the mute button. I laughed so hard that my coworkers started to become concerned. The entire office went quiet. Everyone was staring at me. I took so long to compose myself that the user almost hung up. I stood up and locked eyes with each of my coworkers one by one, trying to gain some moral support for one of the hardest sentences I have ever had to say without laughing. I unmuted the phone.

""The number 5 cannot be capital, and it does not meet the complexity requirement for an uppercase letter.""

I didn't make it. The last half of my response was said through a long, drawn out laugh. I had to mute the phone immediately after saying it because everyone around me started laughing at the ridiculous sentence I had just uttered into the concerned quiet of our small office. After calming them down, I unmuted the phone, apologized, and, in the most professional voice I could muster, suggested that he capitalize one of the letters. 

A few minutes later the call was over and I clocked out for a much needed break. On the way out, my boss told me that he was looking forward to the incoming escalation for laughing at a user on a call. 

I told him to make sure and record that call with his boss. There's nothing like a good laugh at an exit interview.",talesfromtechsupport,1834,1524878124
OpenScore,Can we get back at zipping files with password,"I work sysadmin at a company outside EU, but that deals with EU customers. Due to regulations coming in force this may, GDPR, we are required to use secure methods to transmit confidential data between us, the client and the main contractor (we subcontract the work from the main contractor). So, the main contractor, asks us to use PGP encryption to deal with it.

Fine, let's do it. I went full steam ahead, prepared  set of keys (Public and Private), did produce a manual on using gpg4win (my decision for making the life easy on my non-IT colleagues) both on encryption and decryption, teached them how to use it, and we're all set to start using it. Got also the pub_keys from the client and main contractor (they stated that we can use these keys for encryption).

I personally try to enforce the usage of encryption to my non-IT colleagues, and it seems good.

Within days, both client and main contractor (not those who made the decision to go for encryption, but more like sales/customer ppl) start complaining that they can't open the data we sent, and ask for plain old files. Even going as far as saying:
&gt;I authorize you to give me the plaintext files. 

This despite the fact that the request for using encryption came literally from the boss of the boss of the boss of these persons. 

My non-IT colleagues were kind of terrified on what to do, and me bluntly telling them to keep using encryption...

In the end, since both the client and main contractor didn't deploy encryption/decryption procedures or even tell all the people of the new policy, it was decided to just zip/rar the files with a password.

Oh, and the client is a major ISP in an EU country and the main contractor has a global presence in that specific market. ",talesfromtechsupport,601,1524838641

I let her know she is going to have to format it if she wants to use it. But no... apparently, she has files on it, files that for whatever reason cannot be copied onto either her personal computer or the MacBook during the format. I let her know that she will have to buy another drive then or do a long and painful cloud upload if she is unwilling to copy drive files somewhere else.

hollyhock_,In Which a Sleepy PC Tears a Department Apart,"It has been less than two hours since this debacle resolved itself, and I feel I need to record this for posterity.  It truly is an epic tale.

About two weeks ago, it began.  I walked into our little control center where I am primarily a Security Officer, but my job description includes tech support to the department for a minor pittance.  You see, my boss got wind of my ability to build PC's like many of my generation.  So, that qualified me for a whole host of duties in my boss's mind.  Now I am, on occasion, expected to perform feats of network engineering that boggles the minds of our actual network engineers.  This is not one of those stories.  Basically, I am a security officer, paid less than a desktop support technician, to occasionally give direct support to the department that sometimes network engineers won't touch (i.e. our IP camera network).

So, I walked into our control center and I was told that the Duty PC was going to sleep, but unable to wake.  Interesting.  I look at it, do the dance with the mouse, the keyboard, they don't respond.  I push the power button and we are back in business.  However, there was a slight graphical error on wake.  A whole bunch of vertical and horizontal lines flickered, but then they were gone.  I didn't put too much significance to it, but thought I should investigate more.

I looked into the settings for the PC to wake from sleep from keyboard and mouse input.  I hit an admin wall.  It seems I am not qualified to tell the PC to wake from mouse or keyboard input (I was previously denied admin rights by the head of IT).  I put in an ticket.

In about an hour, I get a reply from my buddies in IT.  They try to troubleshoot the issue remotely, but can't find the issue and are as perplexed as me.  We let it go as unknown/workaround and close the ticket.  The workaround, ""just have your guys wake the PC with the power button.  You said that works.""  The PC is still operational, after all.

""Sure, no problem.""  I say.  I go on to the problem of the monitor flickering and having trouble turning on after sleep.  I look at the video output and find it hooked up to the VGA output.  Thinking there might be an issue there, I swap out the VGA cord with an IDE from my own stash (what's a budget).  I set the monitor to not search for input, but to just use IDE.  Then I send out an email to all my wonderful users who listen every time, that if they need to wake the PC, just push the power button briefly once, and if the monitor doesn't come up, just push power on the button.  I tested it and had no issues on wake up.

So, I hear nothing.  No emails, no complaints, until I come into work a week later.  Then I am told by the Assistant Supervisor that the PC is still doing it and my ""incompetence"" is costing operations time.  ""Well, that's funny,"" I say.  ""I haven't been informed that the problem was still ongoing.  I will look into it.""  Interestingly the boss had left for vacation that day.

""We already did. We got Jason (fake name) on it.  He says it's a video card and needs to be replaced right away because it could die at any moment.  He's going to swap it with the new PC in the boss' office tomorrow for us.""  

""I'm not sure it's the video card, I think it might be the monitor.  I want to do more investigating (when I am not doing security stuff, or messing with cameras, or the million other duties I have).  The PC is still working, after all.""  I say.

""Jason says it's the video card, and we don't have the time to screw around.  Do you know more than Jason?""  You get the idea where this is going.  I just say that I will bow to Jason's superior awesomeness.  I am pretty sure the assistant supervisor is trying to make me look un-needed.

""Now, who is this Jason?"" you, dear reader, might be asking.  He is no other than the best IT guy in the place.  He is super nice and will take time out of any project just to help us out.  Being the best, he is the phone network specialist.  The phone network specialist is currently two weeks behind on a major site-wide phone install because, surprise, he is understaffed and not allocated enough time to do the job.  He is currently building a new sub-net for our cameras.

I take this up with my supervisor.  ""We can't let Jason do this when we are capable.""

""Why?"" asks my supervisor.

""Well, he is the phone network specialist, we can't be asking him to do the job of a level 1 desktop support technician just because he always cuts through the red tape for us.  He is on a major project, high into over time, and killing himself from the stress.  This is my job.  I can plug a darn computer in.""  Surprisingly, the supervisor agrees.

I also went on to explain that we can't replace the PC right away.  It's not dead yet.  (Monty Python anyone?).  We need to get everyone, regardless of ability, to somehow save their passwords, bookmarks, etc.  Most of our apps are web based, and the savvy of us helps the less savvy by saving passwords in the browser.  They need a way to recover them.  

I then spend the next day writing the simplest tutorial I can muster on how to use Google Sync and Google Drive and let everyone know the date of the change-over.  Remember, the boss isn't back yet.  My supervisor says he wants to proofread my work before it gets sent out.  He then sends it out from his account. 

Well, this spawned a huge email fight between me and the assistant supervisor in which I was accused of being unable to perform my duties and costing operations.  It was an obvious power grab, in my opinion.  I tried to be professional in my response, but fell victim to taking the low road a bit, as I felt my ass was on the line.  We both got lectured by the Supervisor for that one.

The weekend comes and goes, the boss is busy playing catch-up all Monday while I am busy writing parking tickets all day.  Monday, I get a ""Sorry not sorry"" email from the assistant supervisor that I am pretty sure he was forced to write by the Boss because he copied the boss.  Today, Tuesday, my supervisor says ""now would be a good time to take care of that PC.""

I go and talk to the boss.  He loves my tutorials and I get lots of respect for it.  (I seriously love my boss, he acts like a real human, respects me, and I do pretty much anything he asks because of it).  I then explain everything about why we need to replace the PC. The Boss is not liking losing equipment.  I tell him I can probably repair it with a new video card someday (HD 7570 is cheap and swapping video cards is what supposedly made me qualified for this position).  I take the only new PC we have out of spares and install it.

It boots.  I see the graphical error.  I want to tear my hair out.  It's the damn monitor and not the PC.  I go back to my boss and have to explain the reason everything I just told him was wrong.  There is a problem, though.  We don't have a 1080p monitor in spares, just old 720p ones.  We do so much multitasking on that PC we need the extra pixels. 

I finally negotiate taking a monitor from another station that doesn't really have room for the big 24 inch monitor.  I swap it with a 17"" 720p monitor from spares.  That works out well.  

I get it set up, return all the other equipment, but I know I have one last job to take care of.  It still won't wake on keyboard/mouse input.  This will be my coupe de gras.  

I get my IT buddies on the phone.  ""You guys busy?""

""Yeah, can whatever you have wait?""

""Sure, but I want to get this done by the end of the day.""

""Put in a ticket and one of us will be down when we can.""

So, my buddy arrives and I explain to him that even though I have written a tutorial on how to push a button to to wake the PC, its too complicated for my users.  We laugh and he understands.  I would rather just fix the problem.

So, we go into the hardware settings.  The options are still missing.  We check the drivers, their fine.  We re-download the drivers, no change, etc.  Finally (lets call him Dude) Dude, decides to check the bios.  Deep inside there are settings under USB devices.  ""Wake PC on USB device input.""  It's unchecked.  He checks it.  We hold our breath.  We boot.  We make it sleep.  He hits the space bar.  It wakes up!  Success!

Now, this is rather peculiar to us.  He runs it up the ladder.  IT boss says to run a malware check and send her the report. She suspects Malware might have somehow changed the BIOS settings.  I don't know how it is in other departments, but any time Malware is found on our PC's heads roll.  I can't wait.  (note, I don't have the access to install Malware Bytes, But Dude does).  

The scan takes forever, I am literally down to five minutes left.  It's done!  I copy the report, send it off, and click quarantine.  I look over the report.  Just as if it were Christmas, every username on the report is a person who I know to be an inept and careless user.  You know, the ones who don't know how to push a power button to turn on a PC from sleep.",talesfromtechsupport,997,1524616201

LaPiscinaDeLaMuerte,My Daughter Is Smarter Than The People I Do Work For.,"So this is my first post here. I love reading your stories since it resonates so well. A little backstory on me, I work IT for the US Air Force. I deal with everything from a cop who doesn't know the difference between a donut and a cell phone to the Intel guys who are entirely too smart for their own good...but still can't work a computer to save their lives.

So, with that out of the way, onto my story. Today, I was driving my wife to an appointment she had and my kids (6 and 3) both had their tablets so they could watch PBS while we drove. For some reason, my 6 year old's tablet was giving her some lip and I could hear it freaking out. I ask her what was wrong but before she replies, I hear the powering off sound. I asked her if she turned it off and she replied with ""Of course I did. I had to turn it off and back on again so I could fix it."".

Right then, I knew that I had trained her right. And then it hit me, my 6 year old is smarter than 90% of the people who put tickets in for me to work. Got me a nice sense of accomplishment today.",talesfromtechsupport,3989,1524505095
lawtechie,"You may have thought you screwed up badly, but you've never fought a robot...","A co-worker inadvertently nuked some production VMs, causing a small service outage. After cleaning things up, they were outside awaiting some official reprimand. I told them this story to feel better.   
  
Many years ago, in the late 90's, when dinosaurs still walked the earth and Sun was still relevant, I was one of two backup administrators at a pharma company. For separation of duties, I worked the 'non-regulated' side, which meant everything but clinical testing. File servers, database servers and laptops I tried to touch. I had a routine:  

  

* arrive at work  

  

* acquire coffee  

  

* check backups, flip DLT tapes and send the offsite tapes to Iron Mountain.  
  
* Do everything else my job required   

  

Backups ran overnight. As our company was growing more quickly than the IT budget, our backups were starting to 'wrap around' and run into the morning. This was an issue as the backup traffic and system load was non-trivial on the backed up systems. This was even more annoying when we were running out of capacity on our tapes. I'd sometimes have to manually stop a backup and re-queue it for that evening.   
  
To make matters worse, the tape drives I had were hand-me-downs from the 'Regulated' side. I had a handful of single tape and 5-tape cartridge drives and could only get tapes after they no longer needed them. Regulated got the shiny stuff, including a 60 tape, 5 drive device with a robot and new tapes.   

The 'Regulated' team was an internal silo. Everything they did was documented and had to follow a standard procedure. Any variation from that procedure had to be written up in detail by some of the most literal non-technical people I've ever met. I did my best to stay on my side of the fence.

One week, I had to cover for the 'regulated' backup administrator. I printed out copies of their procedures the night before and set aside a handful of new tapes.  
  
The next morning, I feed five new tapes in the robot before coffee and my own backup tasks.  
  
This was a mistake.   
  
While I'm packing up my tapes for offsite storage, I check with the Regulated tape library to make sure it's working as expected. I'm getting zero throughput on the tapes I just put in. A quick test command show that the library sees the physical device, but can't write to the tapes. This is no bueno.  
  
Attempting to multitask, I grab a stack of new tapes and the Iron Mountain box and run to the server room containing the robot. It's 9:45 and the Regulated backups kick off at 10am. I'd rather not learn how to fill out an exception report my first day.  
  
My day gets no better when I see the tape library. Some joker has put confetti in it.  
  
I open up the cabinet and start picking out the confetti. It takes a few minutes to realize that the confetti is advertising the exact model of tapes I'm using.  
  
Oh, no. I notice that the new tapes have a thin cardboard wrapper around three sides of the tapes. One side is the same white color as the tape while the other helpfully describes the tape and benefits of purchasing it. Some fool opened the cases and flipped the wrappers around, then put them back in the case. A second fool didn't notice the cardboard and shoved the tape + wrapper in the tape library.  
  
I was that second fool and I had less than ten minutes to solve this. I needed to find all the cardboard and remove it without interrupting the backup or breaking anything. There are no obvious tools in the server room. The next office was the Windows server lead, George. George kept a few spare tapes in his office for convenience's sake. I saunter over in the hopes that I don't have to confess my idiocy.   
  
me:""Hey, George, how's it going?""  
  
George:""It's fine. I'm planning on staying late to ...""  
  
I stop listening as I scan George's office for useful tools. I see my salvation in a carton of Lo Mein in George's trash. Two bamboo chopsticks are sticking out of the carton. I walk past George and grab the carton and chopsticks.  
  
me:""That's great. Can I have this?""  
  
I don't wait for George's reply as I run back to the server room. Five minutes.  
  
I open the cabinet and eject all the tapes manually. It seems that four tape wrappers are intact while One is shredded. Good.  
  
I remove the wrappers and put all but one of the tapes back in and start picking the cardboard flakes out of the remaining drive. As I grab them with the chopsticks, I'm putting them on the floor to reconstruct the wrapper. I've got a few bits and no time.   
  
I break off a bit of one of the chopsticks to pin the switch that tells the tape library that the cabinet's closed. This is dangerous, but gives me a bit more time to find the remaining wrapper bits.   

I find the second to last bit on the bottom of the cabinet. Then the robot spins up and tries to load a tape in the empty drive. I see something cardboardy hanging from the bottom of the tape-grabber part of the robot.   
  
A few attempts with the chopsticks and I manage to pluck the last offending cardboard from the tape grabber. I slam the door shut and the tape library continues, nobody the wiser.  
  
Except for George, who had been watching me suppressing laughter for the last few minutes.   
  
No harm, no foul, no paperwork.

ZathuraRay,What would you do if I was quadriplegic?!,"TL;DR A lazy user gets a surprising response.


Some background: in the UK,  Openreach own nearly all the phone lines, but ISPs can install their own infrastructure at the exchange. This means that depending what the problem is, engineers from entirely different companies might be sent out. As you'd expect, whoever is at fault eats the cost. If it's the customers fault, they get get to enjoy that just-been-billed-hundreds feeling.

Anyway, one time a guy called with slow line speed issues. I check the connection on the exchange side. Yup, that's slow. Records show its consistently slow. I test the line, and the line tests A-OK up to the master socket belonging to Openreach, but detects a short beyond it.

That reading could be wrong, or it could be a fault with something we supplied, but 99% of the time it's end-user equipment. And that means it's troubleshooting time.

Me: "" It's testing as having a problem inside the house. We're gonna need to disconnect everything and plug the router straight into the master socket to see if that resolves the fault.""

Lazyguy:"" Can't you just send an engineer?""

Me:""Well yes, but if they come to your house and find a problem with something that belongs to you, they'll unplug it and you'd be charged (comically expensive callout fee).""

Lazyguy: ""What?! That's outrageous! What would you do if I was quadriplegic?!""

&gt;Several months earlier on a lost connection testing as a fault in the house...with a quadriplegic...

&gt;Me:""Well, I can send an engineer to troubleshoot for you, but it's Saturday afternoon. They won't be there until Monday at the very best. Do you have anyone who can do these check for you?""

&gt;""No, they're away until Tuesday. Give me a minute....""

CipherTheTerminator,Screaming at field service may not work as well as actually working a problem,"**tl;dr: Field service versus Big Shot Boss doesn't quite go down the way BSB thought.**

Reading [this TFTS](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/86h5jy/i_think_i_influenced_someone_to_quit/) reminded me of my first dealings with a screamer of a Big Shot Boss.

Circa 1996, I'd been doing field-circus for less than six months and out on this call for a FruityOS desktop issue; before this I""d worked as a FruityOS depot repair tech for two years, so this isn't unfamiliar territory.

I arrive on site at this small (apparently fewer than ten employees) company and get a brusque-finger point and ""that machine isn't working"" for a total of a description from BSB. There's four desktops in that area, and my technical omnipotence hasn't fully grown in yet at this phase of my career. Fortunately, the woman using the problem system is much more helpful and walks me through exactly what causes the error she's getting.

I don't recall the exact issue, but it was about half an hour to troubleshoot, test, and confirm working. I track down BSB and inform him she's all set and working. He grunts ""the database isn't working"".

Now, in this era and for this size client, an actual relational and/or transactional database really isn't a thing. On the PC side of the house it's usually Abscess, and most FruityOS DBs are FileMangler; it's the big seller at the time, usually a workgroup share off the main user's desktop - servers are for those fancy folk who deal in High Finance^tm environments.

Fortunately^[dubious] two years of depot has brought me into close contact with FileMangler and its innards for layout and scripting. I poke around the system a bit and determine FileMangler's back end (running on the same system that had the issue I worked on previously) is hung up and I restart the application.

BSB comes out and **completely loses his shit**, how I should never have touched the database and now its broken, etc. Surprisingly, this is the first time I've had a customer screaming in my face in my tech career, and I BSOD; Once he's done running up the front of me and down the back I sit down and wait for him to give further instructions.

Nothing happens for fifteen minutes, and I finally pull out my flip phone (such a luxury in the era!) and call HQ to describe the whole scene, including how I think I've major-league screwed up. My boss (one of  three partners) tells me not to worry, and to leave for my next call.

It's a day later when I'm called to the boss's office. She doesn't lay into me, but explains BSB is obnoxious like this on the best of days. Their database is a grossly-unstable beast because of his 'fixes' put into it and my actions of trying to fix it were perfectly reasonable. ""And oh, by the way, he continued to yell at people for the rest of the morning, and his executive assistant walked out,"" I'm told.

The executive assistant, I'm informed,  is his **mother** who, after seven years of this nonsense, apparently had enough of her brat of a child.

**Epilogue**

Six months later the same BSB was on the phone with my boss, and I got waved into her office as I was hitting the parts depot to hear her tell him, ""No, we're not renewing your service contract. You completely alienated our only FruityOS technician and he refuses to set foot in your office again.""

ZathuraRay,You need to open port D00QI? That smells like BS! Let's find out together.,"For several years as I was working retail ISP support, there was a major US game console manufacturer who were fond of palming off their multiplayer connectivity problems onto ISPs when they had an outage they couldn't explain. At least in our region, anyway.

Inevitably, all our staff knew when this was going on, because we knew if *we'd* changed something. If there had been no firmware or hardware rollouts, but suddenly every third call was a request for help with port forwarding, someone at borked something and didn't want to admit it.

Additionally, anyone who called us about port forwarding was inevitably too ill-informed to do it.  Of the many, many users who called, not one of them could provide a recognisable protocol or port number. Just gibberish strings of letters with the occasional number thrown in for fun, to the point where I am pretty sure these poor users couldn't have all written them down wrong.

All we could do was explain what we needed and send them back in an endless hellish loop until they gave up or the outage was over.

One day, after another long string of numbers, I snapped, and asked the kid on the other end of the line:

&gt;""Do you believe them?""

&gt;""Not really. It worked without doing this before, but what can I do?""

&gt;""Well, there's one thing we can do to prove it one way or the other... We can turn off the firewall and put it in the DMZ.""

(For civilians playing along at home, putting a machine in the DMZ is A *Bad* Idea. All incoming internet traffic will be autoforwarded to that machine, unless there's a rule that says otherwise. There'a good chance that machine will be compromised in hours, or even minutes. On residential-grade networking equipment, it's An *Unbelievably Bad* Idea, as you will end up with compromised equipment on the same switch as everything else.)

So I explained the potential horrors, he agreed anyway, and I talked him through it. 

Surprise surprise, no connection. I arranged to call him back in 20 minutes while he rang console tech support.

They couldn't fix it, but both of us got to enjoy that smug feeling of catching them out as we reset the DMZ settings, and he got a months gold account credit.

AcrolloPeed,"""WHY WOULD YOU DO THE THING I JUST TOLD YOU TO DO??""","Short version: I work tech support for medical practice management software. There's a built in patient ledger that also allows for the creation of e-claims and receipt of claims. Once you've sent and received a claim, entered payment, and scanned in the Explanation of Benefits, it's really hard to delete claims because you basically have to undo each step of a 5-6 step process. We explain this in our online manual and when you call on the phone. Last week, I take this call.

Customer (C): I need you to help me delete a claim. It was misentered and it's messing up our daily production.

AcrolloPeed/Me (AC:) I can help you with that. *Remote connects*

C: See this claim here? We billed a few procedures but one of them was in the wrong format and they didn't pay us.

AC: Let's look at the EOB you scanned in. It looks like you did get paid for the procedures that were billed correctly?

C: That's right.

AC: I would leave this claim alone and send a new one for the other procedure rather than delete or edit this claim. All the info is correct; you billed a bad procedure and didn't get paid, but the EOB shows that. You can send a new claim but just make sure to put the right date of procedure and it shouldn't affect your monthly production, you'll just get paid later, obviously.

C: I don't want to do that, I want to delete this claim and start over with the right procedure!

AC: I really don't think you should do that, we'll have to delete the EOB and the payment line item since you received payment from the check, unpay the procedures that you billed correctly, set the claim unsent, delete the bad procedure, re-enter it as the correct procedure, re-send it to the insurance company, and they'll reject the procedures you did correctly since they were already paid.

C: I want the customer's ledger to look neat and I want the claim to look correct, so do all that!

AC: I will walk you through that. Do you have the EOB and the check information? If I delete it all, we can't get it back from the system; it will have to be manually re-entered and scanned by you, since I'm obviously not on-site and don't have access to your paper files.

C: Yes! Fine, delete it!

AC: *goes through process of getting claim process back to square one* Okay, ma'am, now you need to delete the bad procedure, create the correct one, set it complete, and rebuild the claim.

C: YOU DELETED ALL THE CLAIM INFORMATION! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

AC: *silence, then:* Pardon me?

C: You deleted the EOB and the check and all of the procedure information!

AC: Yes, per your instructions, I took you back to the beginning of the process.

C: I NEVER TOLD YOU TO DO THAT!!!

AC: Ma'am, are you being serious? You literally told me to do exactly that, and I told you that if I deleted all of this data it would need to be re-entered manually, which is why I suggested leaving this claim as is and submitting an additional one for the correct procedure.

C: I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO RE-ENTER ALL THIS INFORMATION!

AC: Ma'am, what did you expect to have to do? Per your instructions, I have taken you back to step 1 of the claims process.

C: I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE SCREEN CAPTURES OF ALL THE STEPS AND THEN RE-DO THE CLAIM FOR ME!!

AC: ...I am not going to do that; also, I *can't* do that. You have the paperwork needed to start the process.

C: No I don't! I shredded all that weeks ago!

From here, long story short: both the customer (a doctor, no less) and her nurse practitioner coworker spent some time verbally abusing me as I laughed into a muted mic about how I'd screwed up their entire accounting process. I reminded them both that this issue started with the fact that they billed an invalid procedure to insurance, and instead of just sending an additional claim, they tried to edit an already-finished claims process manually.

After the 3rd explanation that yes, they *would* need to re-enter the claim manually since it was deleted per their repeated instructions and against my own judgment, they ended the call. I jotted down the ticket number so I could check on the account later; sure enough, they called in the next day, hoping another tech could ""fix"" the ""mistake the other tech made.""

manleynotboyley,"It doesn't work like that. Do it the proper way, next time.","I was a teacher's assistant for a programming class six years ago, in my senior year of high school. The class I was assisting was the last class/period of the day. So the students in that class' job was to turn off the computer before they go home.

The bell rang, everyone rushed through the door, except me. I don't do that, except if I'm in a hurry. As I go through the door, the teacher called me, and asked me to turn off the computer, as one of the students forgot to. I obliged as it wouldn't take more than a second, or so I thought.

&gt; $manleynotboyley: When you press and hold the power button for five seconds. It's like what you said. But if you simply tap the power button, it's like I said. It let the computer know that it's time to shut down.

I wouldn't mind doing it the ""proper way"" but those Windows 2000-based Dells takes about 20 seconds before the start menu even opens. Then another 30 seconds before the shut down menu shows up. With simply pressing the power button, you can bypass all that and still shut the computer down properly.  Thankfully, I've heard that they retired those relics for Windows 7-based ones just after I graduated. ",talesfromtechsupport,1280,1524321819

Throwawaythinker31,"""I needed more permissions""","So this is during my first job as a network engineer for a small MSP.

One day, during a slow week with lots of thumb twiddling and few calls, suddenly the phones blow up.

All being calls from the same client (multiple sites) about icons and programs no longer working on their terminal server. After fielding a handful of these with much 'yesses' and 'ill connect in right away and have a look's, I get the one call that explains it all.

This guy, $InternalAdmin calls up and says right off the bat ""I think I've done something bad"". Which comes as sort of a surprise as he's usually not this level of PEBCAK. I ask a few more questions and confirm he is calling about the same issues all the other users advised. He then elaborates why he might have done something bad. ""I was trying to give myself and another user more administrative rights using the registry editor"". No. Just no way would that achieve his goal of more administrative permissions.

It was some third party application he was trying to modify to allow himself more control.
In reality he ended up bricking the server completely as once a user logged out and back in all they had was their desktop screensaver. No icons, no taskbar, no programs. Nothing.

Queue the boss and I at 2 in the morning trying to restore the server with little luck as the image wouldn't boot. (In the end the raid array had to be recreated) lots of cursing and swearing later  the server was back in production and $InternalAdmin no longer had any administrative rights of the sort.

Tension27,"When you're asked to work for your old job for free, for ""Old time's sake, and because you didn't finish"".","Hello TFTS,

So back in December, I got a new job away from $MSP. Between the crazy clients, an owner that made ridiculous demands, and crap pay and benefits, I went on a hunt and found a much better position. It's been several months now since I've been with the new company now, but that doesn't mean that I've heard the last of $MSP sadly. 

$me = Tension
$OB = Old Boss

So back in February, I was going through training on the company software, and getting the tour through our vCenter environment and setup. Things were going pretty well overall, I had just gotten flown out to California for training on the company dime, and I got to meet my coworkers in the west coast office. The day comes to a close, and I notice that I had received calls from $OB. Normally I would just ignore those calls and go on with my life, when I put in my two weeks with $MSP, rather than have me go through with it, he let me go that day. The day he let me go I still had to be up before the sun to perform a firewall install for a client, copy over their rules, and documents it all within the system. I got as far as install and copy, this is important.

I call back $OB later that night to see what he needs.

&gt; $Me: ""Hey $OB, I see you called a few times. Sorry I missed them, was in meetings and training.""

&gt; $OB: ""You finally called back, thank you! We need your help with $client site! Their firewall went out, and we have none of the settings documented. This was your install, do you remember what the configurations were?""

&gt; $me: ""I can't say I do. That was back in November. If you still have their old firewall on hand, you could just copy the configurations from that though.""

&gt; $OB: ""That's already been re purposed. We need those configurations immediately. Can you work on this for me tonight? For old time's sake and to finish up what you left incomplete?""

I get a slight chuckle of disbelief from this.

&gt; $me: ""$OB, you're asking me to not only work for free, but to remember IP settings, rules, and all their VPN tunnel settings off the top of my head. You let me go before I could document any of that, and you said that one of my former coworkers would tackle that. I have no reason to do anything.""

&gt; $OB: ""So you're saying you won't help? After all I did for you through the years? All the training I provided to you?""

My boss had me train for free on a backup software they use, and he did squat for me while I was there. Hell, he gave us all financial responsibility books one year as our Christmas bonuses. 

&gt; $me: ""No, I'll help, but it's $125/hr, minimum two hours down. I make no promises, but I'll do everything I can to get $client back up.""

&gt; $OB: ""That's ridiculous! This was your work that you failed to complete! I shouldn't have to pay you for this! If you don't do this, I'll sue you for damages I'm going to suffer!""

&gt; $me: ""Those are my terms. If you don't like them, then I wish you luck. You may want to dig through old documentation, you may have something left.""

&gt; $OB: ""F*ck you!""

He hung up the phone after that, and I heard nothing back. I know they had to have had the old firewall documented somewhere before my leave, so unless someone deleted that, they should've been fine. Nothing legal has come through to me, so he was just trying to use his standard bully tactics to get what he wanted without paying OT to his current employees. As far as I know, two other people left the company shortly after me, and they have yet to staff it back up since, so at this point, he's putting himself under well enough without my help.

Netto7421,Lying on tickets doesn't help anyone,"I work at a Pre-K - 12 school and we constantly have to remind teachers and staff how tickets work and how to submit one. I even started a ""Monthly IT Reminders"" email with the direct link. This happened today.

One of the Kindergarten teachers, who already complains about a lot, put in a ticket (YAY, she actually did it correctly) saying her school-issued iPads were not connecting to the internet. Other grades have testing today but I had a few minutes to go take a look before testing started, so I head over. She says, ""so I know I'm not supposed to put in tickets for personal devices...."" Right then I almost walked out. She has five fire tablets and five android phones sitting on her desk that someone donated to her (not to the school, but to her personally). I gave her a look akin to that of a disappointed parent.

Our network has problems with Android devices, which doesn't matter because there are no school-issued Android devices on any of our campuses. We are waiting on an update from the manufacturer to fix it, but it's literally the least important item on my list and has no effect on work whatsoever.

A few months ago, a lot of the staff would ask for help with personal devices so I added a question to the ticket system before they submit that asks if the device they are having an issue with is a school-owned device. If not, we are unable to assist. She marked yes and said they were her school-issued iPads just to get me in the room.

To sum up: she lied about having an issue with school devices to get me in the room to help with personal devices. I didn't assist her and reiterated that we cannot help with personal devices. Both of our time has been wasted. Her future tickets are now much lower priority. Moral of the story, don't lie to the people you are asking for help.",talesfromtechsupport,3760,1524141735
kjata30,"Don't click the link? Okay. I clicked it, now what?","FTLT, etc. I'm primarily a software developer, but our engineering department is also our IT department, and as such when $Boss is out all of the IT calls go to me. So begins our descent into the madness of teaching internet security to the technically illiterate.

Our story begins on the second day of $Boss's business trip to Important Client™. I get a frantic email from $SecurityRisk (one of our operators) yelling about her email being hacked. I book it over to her cubical to get the full scoop: around a dozen clients have sent her an email complaining about receiving phishing emails from her address. I immediately check her outbox and see nothing of the sort has been recorded.

Understanding that this doesn't rule out the possibility of a breach, I immediately suspend access to her account and ping $Boss to grant me access to the remote email server. Checking the server logs, I see absolutely no sign of intrusion or evidence of the phishing emails leaving our server. Huh, this is very suspicious. This means that either the culprit has complete admin control of the box (incredibly unlikely, given that the rest of our system doesn't appear compromised) or that the emails have been somehow spoofed. Suspecting the latter, I take a closer look at the headers of one of the phishing emails, which has been forwarded to us by a cooperative client. Apparently the phisher had been masquerading as $SecurityRisk by spoofing the ""From"" field, which includes both a human-readable name and the email address. Applications like gmail to show just the name to users, which is what caused the alarm: apparently the phisher had just been using her name, but the email address was clearly from some throw-away hotmail account.

After sending out an email to everyone@$MyCompany and our clients making them aware of the phishing attempt and (internally) good email practices in general, I had hoped to get back to my work. Alas, $SecurityRisk sends another frantic email a few minutes later complaining that ""a hacker was still in her account and sending emails, with proof!"" Okay, I need to nip this one in the bud, so I wrap up what I'm doing and go over to see what she's complaining about.

At her desk, I ask her to show me the ""hacked"" emails, and see exactly the same culprit using exactly the same phishing scam I described in the email. However, this time he decided to send an email directly to her, using ""her own"" email account. This email body contained an (admittedly real looking) link to a drop-box account that was clearly another phishing attempt. After telling her to just delete and ignore it, she responded by saying ""but what should I do with the drop-box window?"" I spin around and see that she had clicked the dangerous link, 5 minutes after receiving an email where I **explicitly** informed everyone **not to click suspicious links in emails** and seconds after I told her **in person** not to click it! I confiscated her computer and sent her to her manager. We wiped the computer.

Needless to say, the situation was resolved when absolutely nothing changed, she was issued a new (much better) computer, and continued complaining about ""spammy emails"" for the rest of the week.

**tl;dr:** User ""gets email hacked,"" which is just a clever phishing attempt, is told that it's a scam and to avoid clicking links from the scammer, clicks the link anyway, no discipline received whatsoever.",talesfromtechsupport,3256,1524065915
jamesjaceable,The system is down for maintenance.,"So we got this lovely gem of a call earlier. 

Me: Welcome to [Company] how can I help?

Customer: Oh but I really need to do the thing now, can you not just put the system online for a few minutes for me?

So I go get my manager, explain that 'customer' won't take no for an answer and put them on the call. 

Manager: I'm sorry that you're unable to do anything on the system, but this maintenance has been planned for two weeks and you will have got emails advising you it will be down between 12:00 and 15:00. 

Customer: I got the email I just don't believe you really have to take it down for that long, or at all. If you're not going to help me I'm going to write a formal complaint to my manager and yours. 

Manager: Feel free to write a formal complaint and please copy in [Director of IT] since this will go to him anyway. Have a nice day. -hangs up on customer-

xxifty,When Incompetence Strike You Back,"This story takes place at an old employer. They were a nonprofit private school. Overall, they were great but were limited by funds for a two man IT department. Most days consisted of me doing the planned upgrade or maintenance and wasting time since I was part-time and needed to be a warm body there to take home a paycheck.

Part of my duties was help desk type support. Most people were more than understanding about my lack of time and would actually communicate if something could wait or if they needed me to get there ASAP. They respected my time and I in turn would actually come if it was an emergency that kept them from doing any work. Anyways we had this one user who I will call Debbie. Debbie was a nice lady who had no idea what the word emergency meant. After the first few times, I stopped going to her immediately and would make her wait for a bit since more than likely she was just doing something stupid and would figure it out or would figure a way around it for a while. One day Debbie was exceptionally frantic. She called me and I could tell in her voice that there was a big problem.

&gt; Debbie: xxifty, please come quick its an emergecy.

&gt;xxifty: Whats going on? (rolls eyes thinking I hope this isn't another mouse scroll issue)

&gt;Debbie: I can't do such and such in *random Adobe program*. I really need you to come quick I need to turn this in ASAP.

So I go down to her computer and look at what she is trying to do.  Now I am not into design so I have to spend a few minutes just getting familiar with the Adobe program. All along  she is trying to rush me while I am telling her ""it will take as long as it takes because I don't know anything about this program"" and ""you have more experience with this program than I do.""

I figure out the little thing she wanted thanks to finally giving up and googling it. I show her how, ask if she needs anything else, and leave. About 15 minutes later I get another frantic call from her.

Realizing that this is just another user training, I decide to finish what I am doing before I go down. I tell her I will come down when I can. Five minutes after that I get a frantic call from her begging me to come down now.

I figure she is probably just having a bad day so I go ahead and go down, Google what she needed to know, show her how to Google then leave. I tell her if she has anymore stuff she needs to know how to do, look there first.

At this point I am pretty proud of myself, I have taught a man (or woman) to fish as they say and I start back on my domain controller migration (which went really smooth despite being interrupted) and finish my work for the day.

The next day I have another series of random calls where I end up going to retrain her how to use Google. After some time, I go to my boss's office and complain about her. (Note: my boss focuses on empathy but knows with just two of us that there are things we shouldn't waste time on). I estimate how much time I have been spending over at  Debbbie and am really just trying to get some empathy from someone who knows her and knows how difficult she can be. He listens and asks if I showed her Google. I told him of coarse but she clearly doesn't get Google so how is she going to understand this Adobe program. He tells me he will take care of it from now on and that anytime she calls just get him to go down there so I don't end up saying something I will regret.

A few days later, I notice him meeting with the dean who is her boss. I don't think anything of it since they both deal with communications. I figure they are planning some layout of something and am glad I don't have to be a part of it. However, a few days after that all of a sudden Debbie is reassigned to the receptionist and the receptionist is moved to her position. Basically Debbie from then on just answers the phone and greets people at the door. I still had my occasional freak out from her such as if Facebook was down or her mouse won't scroll again. But anytime that 0 extension called, I would just check the voicemail because it was always her complaining over not understanding how the internet works, or a sales call.

Hi there, TFTS. You can stop harassing me now. This story happened when I worked in a B2B Internet Service Provider as my first real job, a lowly L1 Helldesk, way back in the beginning of this decade. 

As a little more background before I start, $ISP is a multinational company, although our specializing in B2B market means that we are a small player in this country., certainly much smaller than $OtherVendor. $Customer is also a multinational, billion-dollar business with branches all over the globe, they've been using $ISP's services for a couple of years now, before that they exclusively use $OtherVendor.

it’s now Monday morning in $ISP and I’m in my 13th hour working right after night shift. Showering, fresh clothes, and double time certainly perked me up though, as well as the fresh cup of builder’s tea I have on my desk. 

$L3 arrives at the Helldesk bullpen

&gt;$L3: Hey $Me, where’s that router?

(I pointed to the charred router beside our spare pile.)

&gt;$L3: Holy cow that looks ugly. To think that $ISPSales asked me whether replacing it was even necessary... 

&gt;$Me: Technically it does work, but I think it's best to retire the Terminator from service.

&gt;$L3: Terminator, huh? I can kinda see that. Anyway, you ready? They are already waiting for us.

&gt;$Me: Here or $Site?

&gt;$L3: Neither. We’re having a brunch at a nearby restaurant 

So $Me, $L3, and $ISPManager arrived at the restaurant, where $Customer is waiting. $CustTech is there, as I expected, with $CustManager. I didn’t know the other person sitting with them.

&gt;$L3: Hi guys, this is $Me, He was the onsite engineer last Saturday. 

&gt;$Me: Hi there, good to meet you.

&gt;$CustTech: Hi $L3, $Me, you know $CustManager, and this is $CustDirector, our Director of Operations (**!**).

I’ve met $CustManager and I’ve seen $CustDirector in email communications. But for him to come? This has to be a big deal. No wonder $ISPManager joined.

&gt;$L3: Thanks for coming here, $CustTech, $CustManager, and $CustDirector. Everyone ordered something yet? $Me, the coffee’s amazing here... 

. . . . . 

&gt;$L3: This is a bit unorthodox, but I think it’s best for $CustTech to explain this meeting’s objective to everyone, just to make sure nothing is lost in communication. 

&gt;$CustTech: Right, thanks for having us here. I talked a bit about this with $L3 earlier and called this meeting as a follow up to last Saturday’s problem. 

&gt;$ISPManager: The fire incident? Is there anything we missed?

&gt;$CustManager: No, more like we're missing someone entirely.

&gt;$ISPManager: Not exactly sure what you guys are talking about.

&gt;$CustManager: Let’s ask $Me, Did you see $OtherVendor’s tech last Saturday?

&gt;$Me: Not that I’ll recognize one, but I don’t think so. I was the only one working there aside from $CustTech. Are we on the same SLA? (we have 4 hour to recovery Service Level Agreement for $Customer, outside of force majeure)

&gt;$CustTech: Yes, and since the downtime occured simultaneously. You guys should have arrived around the same time. Do you want to guess when $OtherVendor engineer comes on site?

&gt;$CustManager: This afternoon, if we’re lucky.

&gt;$ISPEmployees: **!**

&gt;$CustDirector: That's after setting our rack on fire. And it’s not an isolated incident, either. We have a 99.9% uptime guarantee, but they’re barely making the second nine.

&gt;$ISPManager: What about your contract? 

&gt;$CustManager: They discounted some of our bills after a LOT of pressure, but it’s not something we want to do every month.
 
&gt;$ISPManager: I see... I understand your predicament, but I’m not sure on how we can help you with another company’s SLA

($L3 grins)

&gt;$CustManager: $CustTech, how many links do we have with $ISP? 

&gt;$CustTech: 22 dedicated for our offices, about 40 sprinkled in some of our sites

&gt;$CustManager: How about $OtherVendor?

&gt;$CustTech: 22 dedicated, like $ISP, and about 200 in our sites. 

&gt;$CustDirector: We’re thinking of migrating all of them to you. 

This is a bombshell. As it is, $Customer is already one of our biggest customer. If they move all of $OtherVendor’s site to $ISP, this will make them our biggest customer by a large margin.

&gt;$ISPManager: That's a bombshell. Should I call $ISPSales here?

&gt;$CustDirector: Please don’t, let’s keep it between us for now. We invited you guys because we need some people to bounce ideas with, to know if it’s viable. That's also why this brunch is on us.

&gt;$ISPManager: (leaning back on his chair) We... might...  be able to handle all of the small sites, should not be too much of a problem… 

&gt;$L3: Your 22 offices, though. I don’t think that’s a very good idea. 

&gt;$CustDirector: Why is that?

&gt;$L3: If we took over your whole network, you will be completely reliant on us. We are proud of our infrastructure, but problems do happen. 

&gt;$CustDirector: What do you propose?

&gt;$ISPManager: We can subcontract another ISP and manage their SLA. But if you want to use them directly, we really don't mind.

I was personally in awe at the discussion. I can troubleshoot most network problems pretty readily. But $L3 and $ISPManager basically redesigned $Customer's network on the back of a napkin that morning. 

Being a lowly L1 operations tech, however, I was not invited to the next few meetings. But from what I heard from $L3, $Customer finally decided to move all of their connections to us, making them our biggest customer.

$Customer's problem with $OtherVendor has been ongoing for a long time. The fire incident turned out to be the straw that broke the camel's back. Reliability is only one part of the equation. Apparently, our prices are also noticeably cheaper compared to $OtherVendor, which makes the decision all the more popular.

The Terminator? It has its own place behind $ISPManager's desk for a while. Last thing I know another tech brought it back home for their personal lab. Pity I left the company before they gave it away.",talesfromtechsupport,1050,1523945865
just_some_random_dud,So our server was hacked by the mailman.,"This just happened about an hour ago and is also my first time posting here. 

I own a small MSP in Georgia. At one point in my life I was a pretty decent technician but these days my job is mostly shaking hands. I try to work a ticket or two every day though just to keep in shape so I can talk intelligently.   Anyway to get to the story..... 

Today one of our monitors alerted us to excessive login failures at one of our largest customers. This is an alert that is set up to let us know if someone has failed to log in successfully several times and is designed to gives us a heads up if there is a brute force attack happening. We have the threshold set pretty low and we get one alert a week just on the shared computers usually.  But this alert was on a faxserver at one of their smaller remote locations. No users typically are at the fax servers so I decided to go ahead and investigate. I fired up screenconnect and was greeted by the windows login welcome screen just spinning. After a few seconds it hit the password authentication window but almost instantly blinked out of it and was trying to log in again.  RED FLAGS immediately! I watched for another 30 seconds or so and saw it hit the login screen again and fail password check 3 more times again almost instantly!  Clearly this was some sort of bot trying to brute force its way into the system.  This is a pretty secure system as things go and we take things like this incredibly seriously.  I am trying to rack my brain and figure out where an attack like this would even come from and why it would be hitting this server which is much less exposed than a lot of other things on the network. 

I grabbed two of my senior techs real quick and put them on the case to try and figure out what was happening and where this was coming from.  We didn't want to log into the system because it might have a keylogger going and we didn't know what the situation was so we were pushing out commands on the backend through Labtech.  Everything kept getting weirder and weirder.  We chased down some suspicious processes with open connections, found something talking to amazon ec2..... something talking to azure......but we were able to determine with some effort that those were benign.  We couldn't find an outside source hitting this machine in the firewall or through the switch. So one of my techs said, ""Maybe it has something already on it trying to brute force itself that will phone home once it gets a domain login???"" 

 So we then decided to isolate the machine on the network to test this theory. Sure enough the attack continued even with no communication from the outside.   It didn't make a lot of sense though..... if the machine was already compromised there are better ways to get passwords? Maybe this is an amateur attempt?  So we start looking for rogue processes. Not much is really running on it and everything looks pretty standard. Regardless though something is causing this so we start terminating whatever looks like the most likely offenders. No luck, every 30 seconds 3 failed login attempts about as fast as you can see.   Eventually we are digging deep and killing svchosts. Nothing is working.  So we deploy a tech to go pick up the server and bring it back to the shop and get it off their network.  In the meantime I call management and let them know we are seeing an attack on their network and we are investigating. 

   This place is only a few minutes away, but as the tech is driving over the attacks suddenly stop. One of the processes we had killed had stopped it.  My tech thinks ESET was the last thing he killed. Maybe we have a compromised ESET process???? How would that even happen???  &lt;panic sets in&gt;  Maybe we have a compromised ESET server???   I play through in my head the thousand machines we have running ESET and start calling my deployment tech (who was sick in the hospital today god love him) and start asking him if he had changed anything with deployment and when it the last time we rebooted the eset instance.  I am pretty close to a full on freak out at this point.  My tech goes ahead and reboots the server to see if the assault continues. After the reboot though it was quiet.  We pushed out a temporary admin account and new password and went ahead and logged into the box to start poking around.  We dug into the event viewer security logs to see what was going on and started to see all of the audit failures.  Weird thing though,  they were all trying our admin account and they were all coming from the local machine???

If you have ever seen this kind of attack normally what you find here is a bunch of common names and account names being tried from various overseas IP addresses.  You will see several logins under ""john"" and ""chris"" and ""root"" and ""admin"" and ""local"" etc and normally it would not come from the local machine.  If you already have malware running on the local machine there are a million better less obvious ways to collect passwords.

 The server had just come back up when my technician got into the remote office. As he walked in the front desk receptionist said ""hey when you get done with whatever you are here for this machine next to me keeps beeping at me.*waves at faxserver*   My technician walked up to the fax server,  picked up a catalog off of the enter key on the keyboard and promptly called back to let us know that we are all a bunch of morons.

We used to make drive arrays including one that had to have some internal settings made via serial connection before it was used. Customer is a small post house in Colorado somewhere that had bought 4x 5 drive arrays, each unit of the 4 needed to be individually configured before use. As a side note this was the very first support call ever on that array.

Of course the customer hadn't configured the drives and it wasn't long before the data went corrupt. not lost mind you, all the file names were there but nothing could be read. I spent the whole dang day on the phone with them trying this and that even though I was pretty sure the situation was hopeless.

The owners of the post house were horrible people, they very rarely spoke, everything was yelled. The editor was a really nice guy, I have no idea why he worked for the jerks. He was a bit of a stoner and I'll never forget the following exchange:

&gt;Editor: Dude, I think our problem is solved.  
&gt;Me: Why, what happened?  
&gt;Editor: The array is on fire.  
He was so calm when he said it, he might as well have said ""My shoe is untied.""  
&gt;Me: (panic rising) Well shut it off!  
&gt;Editor: Not yet.  
&gt;Me: Why not?  
&gt;Editor: Wait for it. 

 
Long pause


&gt;Editor: Okay, they're all on fire now, I'll shut them off.  

In his brilliance the editor realized that if all 4 arrays were on fire there would be no chance any data could be recovered and we could finally quit trying.  

&gt;Me: I'll go ahead and process your RMA, can I call you Monday to set this one up correctly?

It turned out there was a design defect in the controller board in the array which would cause every single one of them to catch fire. Eventually the board was redesigned and the arrays were actually pretty good but I'll never forget that calm voice ""The array is on fire.""",talesfromtechsupport,685,1523900093

Selben,Of Sheep and machine,"**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**

&amp;nbsp;

$Selben: Me! “Technical team lead” previously Tier II ~~helldesk~~ helpdesk technician for a mid-sized company, very skeleton-crew helpdesk 10 of us total for 24 hour coverage (not including supervisors) to support 2500+ company-wide.

$Ditzy: Front desk administrator (*Computers are an obstacle, not a tool*)

$Peer: Random Tier1 technician. (*Tier 1 worked base calls and sorted them to other groups, only basic troubleshooting*)

$Sup2: All around great supervisor, worked his way up from the support line, understands how the helpdesk works.

&amp;nbsp;


$Selben crossed the parking-lot, entering the building to be pleasantly greeted by $Ditzy, and slightly blinded by both her smile and the reflection of the sun from her shiny new desk. Followed by a grunt from $Peer who was working on her machine with his forehead furrowed. Deciding it was best to let $Peer try to sort it out, he continued to his desk which still smelled like onions and mustard. $Snickers had been given some time off as well from recent events, specifically involving a sandwich.

It was not long before $Peer came around the corner with shoulders lowered, $Selben let out a sigh.

&gt; $Selben: What’s up?

&gt; $Peer: I don’t know, $Ditzy’s machine wont power up.

&gt; $Selben: Power light?

&gt; $Peer: Nope.

&gt; $Selben: Power cable?

&gt; $Peer: Tested.

&gt; $Selben: Ask hardware?

&gt; $Peer: He said to ask you.

&gt; $Selben: … Any beeps or anything?

&gt; $Peer: Nope.

$Selben got up and headed over to $Ditzy’s desk, the machine was 100% dead. They got her a loaner machine and ordered a replacement, ticket closed. $Selben attempted to return to his normal day, but after a couple hours he got a call from $Sup2.

&gt; $Sup2: Hey, $Ditzy’s machine wont power on - can you take a look at it?

&gt; $Selben: I already did, this morning with $Peer.

&gt; $Sup2: Her loaner is doing the same thing.

&gt; $Selben: Huh… Okay, I’ll check it out.

Yet again, same symptoms no power dead machine. $Selben replaced the surge protector and had $Ditzy walk through what she did. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. She would get up and the machine would just die, they got her another loaner and chalked it up to evil I.T. spirits and all seemed well for the rest of the day.

&amp;nbsp;

A few days later $Selben was crossing the parking-lot and rubbed his hands together to keep warm, it was pretty cold. $Ditzy stood at her desk with a frown - apparently the loaner had died as soon as she came in. $Selben and $Sup2 found her new machine was ready so they brought it out to her, naturally she had gotten her manager involved and everyone was upset. $Selben handed her the machine, she set it on the desk and slid forward then reached for the power button. $Selben saw a massive arcing static bolt leap the last inch or so from her finger to the computer.

&gt; $Selben: Well, this ones probably dead now too…

&gt; $Sup2: What?!

$Ditzy repeatedly pushed the power button, but again nothing.

&gt; $Ditzy: HOW?!

The desk that $Ditzy had recently received was one of those bent acrylic see through desks. As it was cold she had been wearing wool leggings and a wool skirt which resulted in massive static buildup. She had fried every machine she touched - she was advised to not wear wool skirts if possible and the acrylic desk was removed.",talesfromtechsupport,1391,1523892946
really-likes-tea,"Yeah, it's on fire (Part 1)","Hi there, TFTS. This story happened a long time ago, I didn’t remember the exact dialogue and everything, but the gist of it should be accurate. 

I used to work in a B2B Internet Service Provider as my first real job, a lowly L1 Helldesk, way back in the beginning of this decade. 

I arrived in the office for my Saturday morning shift, expecting a quiet day so I can catch up on my reading. No sooner than after I finished making my morning cup of tea, the dreaded phone rang.

&gt;$Me: $ISP, good morning

&gt;$CustTech: Hi, $Customer at $Site here… uh… Not sure how to say this, but your router caught fire… 

&gt;$Me: **!**

&gt;$CustTech: Yeah, we shut down the power to the rack just now, you should see it soon.

Sure enough, one tiny dot turned red in our 1-minute-timeout NMS. Ruining the beautiful sea of green and, with it, my day. This is a premium level customer, all troubles goes up the chain to Director level.


&gt;$Me: Yep, got it. I’ll bring a replacement unit onsite. Is there anything else we can help you with?

&gt;$CustTech: Not really, thanks. 

&gt;$Me: Right, see you in a few.
    
I proceeded to create an incident ticket, (Eth0 on fire!) grab a spare 1841 from our pile and pulled the latest configuration backup from our system (I have complaints about this company, but thoroughness is not one of them.)

After a cursory glance, I see their router has simple configuration, OSPF and IPSEC. Nothing I can’t troubleshoot onsite (this was before my first smartphone). A quick ‘wr’ and I went on a 20-minute drive to $Site.

As I enter the DC the smell of barbecued technology welcomed me. The fire’s not too big and was localized to one rack - luckily a mostly empty one. Fire department didn’t really do much besides documenting everything. Once finished, they went to talk with $CustTech, who signalled me to join.


&gt;$Fireman: Is this your equipment? (Pointing to a silver box just 2U below my router)

&gt;$Me: No, mine’s the one above. That looked pretty bad.

&gt;$Fireman: Yeah, I thought it was an internal short or overload or something, but looking at the wiring this seems to be an unsafe install

&gt;$Me and $CustTech: **!**

&gt;$Fireman: You see here? The AC input caught fire and there’s nothing much left of it, but the output survived. See those exposed copper? That’s a half-assed job if I’ve ever seen one.  

&gt;$Me: Whose equipment is that?

&gt;$CustTech: $OtherVendor I think, that’s your backup link. This will be an interesting discussion.

They cleared us just after 12 and I had the chance to document everything, pull the charred equipment and give it a once-over on a nearby desk.

Its plastic faceplate melted pretty badly on the blinkenlights side and I see scorch mark all over its bottom plate. That being said, It looked pretty good and I remember it didn’t shut down until the power’s turned off. So I plugged in a console cable and powered it up (I now know this is a really bad idea, don’t worry.) Lo and behold, standard boot sequence. I even pulled the latest configuration from it. 

The router was still definitely toast, so I mounted the replacement, rearranged some cabling around, test the connection and confirm the NMS status is green, asked for customer’s signature on my onsite form, and was on my way back to office on time for a late lunch. 

Back at the office, I grabbed my cup of tea (cold) and the phone rang again. $L3, an engineer dedicated solely for $Customer called and asked for an update.


&gt;$L3: How was it at the $Site?

&gt;$Me: Surprisingly uneventful, considering it involved a fire. Pulled latest config, mounted replacement, test, get out.

&gt;$L3: Wait, you can pull the config? The router TURNED ON?

&gt;$Me: *grins* I was surprised myself, you should see it on Monday.

&gt;$L3: Ha! I’ll put it on a pedestal somewhere. What happened anyway? What’s the cause of fire?

&gt;$Me: $OtherVendor’s equipment, rectifier I think, caught fire

&gt;$L3: $OtherVendor? 

&gt;$Me: Yea, the fireman suspects a bad wiring job.

&gt;$L3: Huh... Look, I need to hang up now. I’ll get back to you in a moment.

&gt;$Me: Sure, make it 1 hour or so, I’m going out for a lunch. 

&gt;$L3: Okay, cool.

After a lunch and a fresh cup of tea, I updated the ticket with more information and $L3 rang again. 


&gt;$L3: Are you available Monday at 10?

&gt;$Me: I have Sunday night, my shift ends at 9 in the morning. 

&gt;$L3: I’ll ask $Manager to approve you for double time. 

&gt;$Me: Fair enough, see you then.

Hanging up, my only thought at that time was only how long until I can go home. Never will I thought this case will bring a great disturbance in the force.

$CustomerManager = The customer's manager


Here $Myself sat. Level 1 HelpDesk technician fresh out of school. Never done physical networking. VLANS, routing, switching, heck even nslookup were all new to me. We'd been having this ongoing issue where a site would lose connectivity to the WAN (and in turn, internet) seemingly randomly for approximately 15 minutes. 

&gt; $Manager: $L1 can you go over to $BusinessName and have a look at their network for me. They're all stating they're losing network. 

&gt; $L1: Okay, $Manager! I'll go over and see what I can find.

I wander over to the business not knowing what to expect. In my head I'm thinking this is going to be some complex fault. I get to the site and lo and behold, exclamation signs on all the PCs, not able to web to anything. It's down.

&gt; $CustomerManager: What the f*** is going on? This has been happening for weeks. I'm not happy. Where is $Manager?

&gt; $Customer: $L3  was here about an hour ago and was looking into things. He said he'd email you $CustomerManager.

Phew, $L3 was here. He's a God. I'm sure he has this fixed. 

&gt; $L1: Hi $Customer, $CustomerManager, I'll call $L3 now and see what the exact go is. 

So I call $L3 and run through the issue. This is the response....to a L1 freshman.

&gt; $L3: Yeah, I've made sure routing is correct, VLANS are tagged correctly, and there are no CSP (Client-Side Proxies) in place. For some reason it seems as though the router isn't passing the requests on. I'm not too sure why. I think we're going to set them up on 4G for the interim. 

I relay this to $Customer and $CustomerManager. Nonetheless this is all fun, so I trace down the IT room with all our IT gear. It's a mess. A literal dive. I poke around and pretend like I know what I'm doing. I look around and all the internet's back up and running, so whatver.

&gt; $L1: Hey $Manager, internet's working. $L3 has some news to relay to you. 

&gt; $Manager: Do you know what's happening? Our Nagios instance isn't complaining of anything going down. 

&gt; $L1: No, not a clue. 

*Yeah look, I'm not a wordsmith.*

An hour passes, and it's lunch time. I shoot over to the business as there is a cafe there as well. I get my lunch and decide to walk over to the IT room and take some pictures. 

&gt; $Customer: Hi $L1, have you got our s*i* fixed yet? Not sure why you guys are taking so long to fix it. I bet it's something stupid.

*You're darn right it is....*

I then watch as $Customer unplugs the router, and plugs in his kettle. 

....he's brewing some tea.

&gt; $L1: $Customer, have you ever realised when you do this, the internet goes down?

&gt; $Customer: Nope. I don't think about it, that's your job.

Amazed, it makes sense. I realise that perhaps to 5 minutes to boil, and 10 minutes to get the internet back up and running. I watch and sure enough, that's what happens. 

&gt; $L1: Hi $CustomerManager, I think I've found the issue. I think $Customer unplugs the IT gear to make a tea. The internet goes down when he does this. Is it possible we could make sure he doesn't do this for a few days until we can prove it?

&gt; $CustomerManager: Is he making Lipton or Tetley?

Yeah, you heard it right. He was more concerned about the tea. Nevertheless, this was a great eye opener for me. Still unsure why Nagios wasn't reporting the router going down (think the refresh was too delayed) and why no-one checked the uptime, but knew there were much bigger fish to fry at the time.

kittyt_rubble,How NOT to Apply For a Job,"I was responding to a post over in r/askReddit, and felt that some of the nuance might be lost. So I'm posting it here.

At a former job, I wasn't the employer, but I was the one the company owner deferred to for selection during the hiring process. He wanted me to assist in hiring some front-end devs for a start-up, and he had no clue what he was doing (full disclosure, I was really young and didn't know either). So I created a simple exam for applicants to complete so that we could gauge their skill set. The base requirement was an understanding of XHTML (yes, the platform we built required all front-end docs to be XHTML compliant).

The exam itself was all about creating a mock-up website within a limited time frame. I did this to gain a better understanding of how the applicant worked under pressure, since the job was extremely stressful with multiple deadlines *daily*. From the start of the exam, we inform the applicant that there is no expectation that they will complete the exam, and nothing that they create during the course of the exam will be used for anything aside from their application.

Within the first week of interviewing front-end developers, *I get* a strange email from a woman out of state. Living about 1,500 miles away. I am not the point of contact, so I initially forward the email to the company owner. He responds by letting me know that he had given her my information, that he had pre-interviewed her, and he thought she was a great fit. From 1,500 miles away. For a position that required someone physically on site.

So I sat and read, and re-read this woman's email. 

The first half was her life-story, talking about her husband and kids. It just sort of rambled on, and from the way she wrote, you could feel her desperation bleeding through the screen. 

The second half was a quick description of what should have been a resume. She briefly talks about her professional experience with about 4 or 5 different companies, but only gives the correct information for one. I do a quick cross-check and view the company website. Honestly, I've seen better Geocities sites in the late 90's and this one only worked half as well. View source, and it's evident to me that this was a copy + paste job as well. 

I go back to the owner and tell him I don't recommend continuing the application process with this woman. He insists that she's the diamond in the rough, that I should go ahead and schedule her for a phone interview and set up the exam for her to perform remotely. 

Okay then. I spend time over the next few days setting up a desktop off our internal network that she can remote in to. I send her a detailed list of instructions to follow for initiating the process, assume that this whole thing is going to be hassle, so I pad the usual half hour window with an hour start and hour finish and notify her that she should set aside 3 hours in total. Sure enough, she calls me so I can confirm that we're able to connect via VPN to the testing platform and that she's able to access the exam correctly, but it takes a solid 45 minutes of hand holding before I'm able to start the test. 

During that period of time, her demeanor starts to switch from being grateful for the opportunity, to why the hell did we make this so difficult. Right, because I had to go through assisting her with installing and setting up the VPN software we used, and it was evident from the get go that she hardly knew her way around a computer. So I remain patient, bide my time, and finally we have a solid VPN connection. The desktop she's remoted into is running Windows Vista (yeah, guess how many years ago this was) and had only the Adobe Creative Suite installed. Her instructions were to use Dreamweaver (preferred, but Notepad was also acceptable) to construct a simple template in XHTML using the guidelines I sent her, and she could access any of the other programs to create additional elements. She had half an hour to create one page.

The test begins, and I hang up. 

I keep an eye on her screen and the timer while I work on other things. At the thirty minute mark, I check in. She's got Notepad and Dreamweaver opened on the desktop. All that she's managed to input is the HTML document tag. At this point, I'm not surprised. I figure she abandoned the test and left the connection open because she doesn't know how to close it. I take over the desktop and proceed to start closing the programs when my phone rings.

Her voice rings through the other end, louder and clearer than a bell. ""HEY! I WAS WORKING ON THAT!"" 

She caught me off guard, so it takes a moment to gather my wits. I calmly explain that the exam is only 30 minutes long. She, again, pleads with me. Starts off with ""but I thought I had 3 hours"" and ends with ""but I was almost done."" Truthfully, I know that this isn't going to end well, and it's lunch time for me. After a few minutes of pretending to be a hard ass, I give in and say she has another hour. She thanks me, hangs up, and I head off to lunch.

When I return, I log back into the machine the exam is housed on, and the screen looks *identical* to the way it did when I left. I screencap the desktop as she's left it, kill the VPN connection, and start to compose an email to the owner. Sure enough, she calls me about 15 minutes later.

At first she tells me that there's something wrong with the connection and that she's been trying to reconnect for the past five minutes. I tell her that her hour was up 15 minutes ago, and the machine has been offline for at least that long. She then changes her story and blames the connection speed. I told her that she has 30 minutes to send me *any* html document that fits the parameters of the exam. Again, hangs up. I fire off my email to the owner, acknowledging that I gave her one last chance to redeem herself - just incase there was a technical issue. 

30 minutes later, I get a nearly empty html document with empty header, body, and table tags. In her poorly-typed email she claims that ""she's done it"" and that I should be more than happy with the free labor I've squeezed out of her. 

With glee, I forward the email, untouched, to the owner. I could hear the resounding ""What the-"" from his office down the hall when he opened it. I don't even bother waiting for a reply. I head to his office and we have an amusing chat about this applicant.

Next day, he sent her a rejection email. It was polite and professional, and we thought it was the end of it. Three days later, she calls back, screaming and yelling at the owner for rejecting her. 3 days. After the email. How often does she check her email? 

She fluctuated between fits of anger and pleading for *another* chance. She accused me of all kinds of things, blamed technology, even blamed her husband for not taking her kids on the day of the exam, and so on. 

Owner gave her a warning, told her not to contact the company again. Idiot woman proceeded to call and harass us for the next week or so, before it finally stopped.

The owner learned his lesson and handed full-control of hiring applicants over to me. Had the positions filled within another week, no additional problems.",talesfromtechsupport,2601,1523729568
explodingphone2016,HARRY POTTER. HARRY F****ING POTTER!,"Sorry if this isn't the right space for my post - most of this is computer related.

I work for a large brand-name phone company on the technical assistance/repair sides of things (we double as a retail store) where it's mostly just either booking in phones/tablets for repairs, troubleshooting software issues or just general advice because people don't know how to google things.

We operate through both pre booked and walk in appointments according to how many people we have staffed on during the day. We're a very opened planned store, with service desks at the back. We do have a concierge at the front who is meant to try and catch every customer who comes in store so they don't just slither towards the back and stand there wondering why no one has helped them but sometimes due to it being ridiculously busy they just can't and customers will take it into their own hands to get served.

I was with a customer already helping her try and find some photos she deleted from both her phone and cloud storage for whatever reason (ended up finding them, anyway) when this older, dishevelled looking man ignores all our floor staff who greet him and comes straight up to the side of my desk, where I'm clearly busy. My initial thought is oh, he must be her husband or dad or something, so I smile at him and say hi and continue what I'm doing for a second before he coughs/grunts and puts his hands on my desk and my customer looks at both of us really confused. 

**Me**: oh! Sorry, I thought you were together. Do you need help?

**Man**: Well yeah, this IS technical assistance right???

I apologise to my customer and jump up from my seat to begin walking towards our concierge who is looking equally as confused - she thought he was my customer from before, or that he was also with my current customer - and explain to him that we are by appointment only but we can see if we have any free slots to fit him into.

He's not happy and starts sighing and grunting and keeps repeating ""this is the only time I've gotten off work"" over and over when I say yes, I know, but we have other people who have been waiting who have made appointments online or have been waiting for ages in store. 

His phone isn't turning on, which means we can't extract data from it (privacy laws and we're not trained in it) and we're a 24hr turnaround time but can give him something to use in the meantime. We just need to book him in first.

Our next appointment is in only twenty minutes so I'm glad, concierge is glad, but he's absolutely furious. He starts yelling and arguing with me about how ""it's the only time I get off work!"" and ""I'm a busy man, just serve me now!""

**Me**: I get that, really, but I'm obviously busy at my job too. As soon as I'm done I'll be able to grab your details and give you a phone to use in the meantime.

**Man**: WHY CAN'T YOU JUST TAKE MY PHONE NOW? *he pushes it into my hands* SEE? YOU ALREADY HAVE IT???

**Me**: *tries giving it back but he's got his arms folded* Because I'm busy, and the rest of our technical staff are busy, so you're either going to have to wait for twenty minutes or we can make an appointment for another day. 

**Man**: WELL YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW IT OUT THEN SINCE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HELP ME NOW

**Me**: I would rather not because it's got your sim and memory card, take it and make an appointment for another day

He keeps his arms folded and nudges the phone in my hands towards me again with his elbow.

**Me**: Okay, well I have a recycling bin for phones just down the back and if you're happy recycling your belongings that's fine with me.

I take one step towards the back of the store and he snatches it out of my hands.

**Man**: I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW BUSY I AM. I RUN ALL THE THEATRES IN *CITY*. WE'RE RUNNING HARRY POTTER. **HARRY F---ING POTTER!!!**

so yeah he left with those parting words and I got to go back and find photos and have a laugh with my customer who had booked an appointment weeks in advance. ",talesfromtechsupport,2012,1523691522

I hope this story is TFTS-appropriate. TL;DR at the bottom. As part of my overall duties I support some very specialized software for my company.

Things were falling into place and I was all set to have just **one** ticket left in my queue before lunch and that ticket was waiting on a deliverable from someone else in another division so the rest of my day was going to be left for my pet projects.


That is to say it was going to be left for my pet projects until there was a whimsical knock on my open door and another division's team leader poked his head around my door frame. The cast of characters for what unfolded is as follows:

**$ME**: The guy who just wants to be left alone in his cozy office.

**$ETL**: Eager Team Lead. An all-around nice guy.

**$AU**: Anonymous User. Fancies being a whistleblower.

**$EP**: Executive Person. Likes to have his way.



*$ETL gingerly steps into my office while swinging his hands with nervous energy.*

&gt;**$ETL:** Hey TK. How are you?

&gt;**$ME:** I'm good. What's up?

&gt;**$ETL:** Oh nothing much. Hey, thanks for all the help with &lt;project&gt; changes to &lt;software&gt;. I talked to $EP and he wants to go ahead and pull the trigger on the other change we discussed.

&gt;**$ME:** *thinking: Other change.. oh! The interface change.* Okay! I'll send you a message once I have it done.
 


$ETL thanked me and walked his polite self out of my office. I turned around and settled into making a user-facing change to the software that I had warned against making, but at this stage debating it any further would basically be like talking to the wall. I made my recommendation, they elected to go another route, it didn't affect the stability of any of my systems so I put on my best friendly personality and took care of my customer.


A little bit later in walks one of $ETL and $EP's users, $AU. $AU looks like they have something on their mind, and they do because the pleasantries are skipped. This is fine with me. I only pretend to have good soft skills anyway. 

&gt;**$AU:** Uh.. hey TK. Why did you &lt;insert change here&gt;?

&gt;**$ME:** $ETL asked me to make the change and said he had $EP's approval. I tried to talk them out of it, but they made the decision to do it. I'm sorry.

&gt;**$AU:** But it makes it difficult to &lt;insert job function here&gt;.

&gt;**$ME:** Yeah. I know. 

*At this point I thought $AU was going to wind up to unleash on me, as you know everything is the fault of the IT department. But they surprised me. Later, they would really surprise me.*

&gt;**$AU:** Oh. Okay. Well hey, listen, don't say anything about me coming to you okay?

&gt;**$ME:** Uh. Sure! No problem.

$AU departed my office and once again I was left in peace to do my thing. Well... for an hour, maybe an hour and a half. I was mentally knee deep in an email my boss asked me to write when I felt a shift in my office's tone. I became acutely aware of someone behind me. Turning slightly, and minimizing my email, I found that $EP had entered my office and was sliding out from behind my chair. This is why I hate having my back to the door. With $EP is $ETL who looks considerably less eager. 

&gt;**$EP:** Can you show me what change you made with $ETL?

&gt;**$ME:** Sure.

*I pull up the administration window for the server application and proceed to explain. There are two screens that are similar and had some slight overlap, I was asked to remove the overlap from one. I explained what each screen now displayed to their end users.*

&gt;**$EP:** Okay. Did someone call and talk to you about this change?

&gt;**$ME:** Well, a conversation was had.

&gt;**$EP:** Can you tell me who it was?

&gt;**$ME:** Um... I said I wouldn't. *gives an uncomfortable, blank stare.*

&gt;**$EP:** I don't understand.

*I swivel my chair around and look between the two of them.*

&gt;**$ME:** What's going on? *looking directly at $ETL.*

&gt;**$ETL:** Someone made an anonymous complaint to compliance about the change.

&gt;**$ME:** Oh. Well, if someone made an anonymous complaint there's no way I'm telling you who I talked to. I can't do that.

&gt;**$EP:** What?? *looking visibly irritated.*

&gt;**$ME:** ...If it was anonymous they don't want anyone to know who it was. I'm not crossing legal and telling you who I spoke to.

*$EP, looking visibly upset, stalks out of my office in quick, angry steps. I suspect that had $ETL not been standing in front of my door he would have slammed the door shut. $ETL gives me an apologetic shrug and leaves.*


TL;DR: Warned against a change in a department's software. Department heads decided to do it anyway. Employee contacts compliance because they believe it adversely affects their work.  Department executive gets mad at me for not telling him who I talked to. Department executive is literally the reason why anonymous reporting exists.

punxsutawneyphyllis,You did WHAT to my machine?,"I debated for a long time about whether to post this, because I had a relatively small role in fixing it, but I feel that it serves as a cautionary tale about what happens when non-tech people do tech stuff.

 

The characters:

$Me - The only programmer at my company.  

$Boss - My boss. Mostly clueless about technology.

$Supe - My supervisor. Not a tech person, but he's far more tech-savvy than $Boss

$Tech - An outside programmer that the company calls when my workload gets too large for one person.  Smart guy, easy to work with.

$OtherTech - A computer repair guy who takes care of the company's machines, because hardware is not my thing.

$NewGuy - A PPC ad guy, newly hired.

 

This tale starts while I am 33 weeks pregnant, and preparing to go on 3 months of maternity leave.  $Boss informs me that $Tech will be taking over my duties while I'm gone.  All fine, I compile a list of what needs to be maintained in my absence and send it to $Tech.  Then $Boss informs me that a new hire, $NewGuy, will be using my computer while I'm gone, because he's in a trial period and they don't want to spend money on a machine for him until they're sure he's staying.  I am not happy about this, naturally, but I have no choice.

 

So, I set up a second account on my machine, and so some registry editing so that this account will not be able to do anything that could cause catastrophic damage in the hands of the clueless.  All good, right?  Wrong.  The next day, $Supe comes up to me and tells me that $Boss wants me to give him the password to my user account, ""just in case"".  He reassures me that it would only be used in emergencies.  I am not reassured, but again, I have no choice.

 

I have my baby, and take my three months of maternity leave.  The day I come back, I am the first person to arrive in the office.  I boot up my computer.  The first thing I see is that there is only one user account on the screen.  The second thing I see is that the name on the account is not my own, but $NewGuy's.  As no one else is in the office, I call up $Tech to see if he knows anything about this.

 

&gt;$Me: Hi $Tech, do you know anything about what happened to my machine?

&gt;$Tech: Nope. Your boss barely had me doing anything, so I never even came into the office.

&gt;$Me: *groans internally* Thanks, have a good one.

 

I wait two hours until the first of my coworkers arrives.  He knows that something happened to my computer, but can't describe it other than ""it crashed"".  This does not bode well.

 

Finally $Supe comes in.



&gt;$Me: $Supe, what happened to my computer?

&gt;$Supe: It was running out of space, and we had to repartition it.

&gt;$Me: What?

&gt;$Supe: We had to get rid of the Linux partition on your computer.

&gt;$Me: My computer didn't have a Linux partition.

&gt;$Supe: Oh. Um...



$NewGuy had arrived while I was talking to $Supe, so I try him next.



&gt;$Me: Hey $NewGuy, what happened to my computer?

&gt;$NewGuy: Oh, I was cleaning up the disk and then it crashed.

&gt;$Me: What do you mean you were cleaning it up?

&gt;$NewGuy: I had to delete some files, the disk was running out of space and I couldn't work.

&gt;$Me: *facepalms internally* I see.  Thank you.




My work computer has a 1TB secondary drive for file storage, in addition to the system drive, so if the system drive fills up, you're supposed to move old files to the secondary drive.  Apparently $NewGuy didn't know this.  I go back to $Supe.



&gt;$Me: $NewGuy said he was deleting files when the computer crashed?

&gt;$Supe: Yeah, after that happened we just had $OtherTech reinstall Windows, since we thought Linux was taking up space on the drive.

&gt;$Me: Do you have his number?



I call $OtherTech.



&gt;$Me: Hi $OtherTech, I heard you reinstalled Windows on my machine?  Could you give me any more details about what you saw?

&gt;$OtherTech: Not really, I just formatted the drive and installed Windows on it.

&gt;$Me: What about the other drive?  And did you do a backup?

&gt;$OtherTech: I only detected one drive when I was working, and no, I didn't do a backup.  Your boss told me not to bother.

&gt;$Me: *fuming* Okayyyyy, I'll get back to you.



I badger $NewGuy to give me the password, and log in to my machine.  I check My Computer.  I see 3 drives there, not including the CD drive. One is tiny, one is almost the same size as the old system drive, and one is a bit under a terabyte.  The one that was a bit under a terabyte was labeled C:\.  It appeared that $OtherTech had installed Windows on the 1TB drive, which meant that all the data on it was lost forever.  I call $OtherTech back.



&gt;$Me: Hi again, it looks like you detected the my machine's data drive, and installed Windows on it.  But there's a much faster SSD that Windows is supposed to be installed on, and it looks like it's split into two partitions, but one of them is tiny.  Do you know why this is?

&gt;$OtherTech: I think I know what happened.  I'll be over in half an hour.



True to his word, $OtherTech arrives in half an hour and pokes around the two drives. Then he explains to me that when he initially arrived and started working, he hadn't detected the SSD because whatever $NewGuy deleted had really screwed things up.  The reason the SSD looked like it was in two partitions is because it was, the tiny partition was the system reserve space from the Windows installation.  He pulled all the salvageable files off of the SSD, took Windows off the 1TB drive, and then reinstalled windows on the SSD.



I go back to $Supe once this is over.



&gt;$Me: $NewGuy should never have been able to delete anything that would make the computer crash from his account.  Did you give him my account's password?

&gt;$Supe: Well, yes, but we had to.  He kept getting these ""disk almost full"" messages and couldn't work.

&gt;$Me: You could have called $Tech.

&gt;$Supe: Look, I'm sorry... We had to make a decision quickly...

&gt;$Me: *gives up*



I spent the next few days restoring xampp and my local sites, as they were huge and therefore stored on my data drive, while fielding complaints that I wasn't getting my work done.  $NewGuy remained at the company, and was never reprimanded or penalized for what he did.",talesfromtechsupport,2254,1523532061
lukan2,It must be nice being the only one with vital technical knowledge in the company,"I was working in a big national media, in the data journalism center where all the tech guys are. I was the newbie and keeping a low profile, which is how I witnessed one very interesting exchange between my coworker (**Peter**) and a journalist working on a big yearly analysis of all the schools in the country (**Lana**). 

One day, Lana showed up in our office and asked for ""the tech guy"". Peter made himself known, thinking he would just fix whatever computer issue she was having and that'd be it. Turns out the company makes a national ranking of all the schools in the country and the tech guy who used to do it every year just quit. Peter is forced into that new role. He tried to get concrete instructions to follow, how to do the damn thing, but Lana just told him ""You're a tech guy, that's your job, not mine"" and gave him the data.

Peter worked himself to the bone on that thing. All day everyday, barely a break to have lunch, for over a week. Turns out Lana had all the info on the **62,000** schools, which needed to be treated and ranked, **on a Word document** because she found Excel too complicated. And every day, she'd come to our office and angrily bitch at Peter for not being done yet, openly calling him useless and stupid. Peter took it like a champ. 

After a dozen days, he called Lana over and showed off his finished work and explain it to her, as he had to basically invent from scratch the entire methodology for it. She looked at it for a minute then said ""Yeah, nah, that's not the method we usually use."" When asked why she didn't say so on the dozens of times she was asked before, she snickered and said ""Just slipped my mind, whatever. But your method won't cut it. Start over.""

I think something broke in Peter's mind. He was dead silent for a few seconds, then wordlessly stood up, walked to our manager's desk, and told him ""I will not tolerate this anymore. I either never work with that woman ever again, or I quit here and now."" He said all that with Lana right there, hearing everything. She screeched it was the end of his career, that she's have his head, that he's a moron who can't even handle such a simple task. 

Our boss walked in, attracted by the obvious commotion. After hearing both sides of the story (and Lana's very smug retelling of how Peter was a moron who worked at a snail's pace), he looked Lana in the eye. ""The company would be in deep trouble with Peter,"" he said. ""He has very valuable skills that nobody else here has. You are expendable, he is not."" I was like a little mouse, keeping very quiet but enjoying the drama. Lana's face fell and she started apologizing to the boss, to Peter, to the manager. And for days after that, Lana was extremely polite and reverent when talking to Peter about how to operate the software and apply his method to the data. The work had to be redone from scratch, but Lana and her team were the ones doing it, while Peter was teaching them the technical aspect of it so he'd never have to do it again. That was pretty awesome.",talesfromtechsupport,2578,1523494072
ultrasuperman1001,"I'm helping you for free at a local library, I'm sorry you shorted out your laptop","My local library has started doing Repair Café's where people bring in anything from jewelry, to small engines, to electronics to be repaired rather than be replaced. I own my own computer repair business and I volunteer there to help give back to the community that got me where I am.

95% of the people that go just need simple help like their computer needs a clean out or they want help with email on their phone. Then there was this one guy with a dead laptop.

He slams this old Windows XP laptop on the table in front of me and says ""fix it"", no context or anything. I ask him ""what's wrong with it"" and he says ""won't turn on"". I then look at his power cable and the first thing I see is he pulled out the ground plug. I mention that to him and he says ""don't need it"". I pull out my universal adapter to see what's going on and there was indeed no power, no battery light, no fans, no error codes, nothing. I do the usual pull the RAM and see what happens but of course that didn't fix anything.

We only have about 15 minutes with each person so I tell him that there must have been a power surge and the power board is fried which happens as computers get older and without a ground plug. He tells me to fix it but I say ""I can't we don't have time for major issues"" and he stomps off. 

About 2 hours later he comes back as he booked another time slot (to be fair it was a slow-ish day so he wasn't kicking someone out). When he comes back he says ""now you should have time to fix it"". Knowing this wasn't going to end easily (and I felt like proving myself right that it was the board) I decided to open the case and low and behold there was a black spot around a few chips. I show him and say ""this is a major repair on a laptop that isn't even supported anymore"". He says ""well I have you booked so take the chips out and make it work"". I reply with ""this is a free event at a local library, what your asking me to do takes hours and requires special equipment and if I may ask why are you so adamant about saving the laptop?"" My thought was maybe it was a family members but his reply ""it was cheap"", he then storms off.",talesfromtechsupport,3601,1523374572

BURNEDandDIED,Who Are You And What Are you Doing On My Computer?,"The scene: me working at a CDN on a quiet weekend afternoon one summer. The phone rings from a number I don't recognize. My department is the last option on the customer support main number, so we get a lot of wacky phone calls from people who otherwise don't know what they want, so I brace myself accordingly.  
  
  
ME: Hello, $CDN technical support this is $BurnedandDied. How can I help you?  
LADY: Yeah... yeah hello $BURNEDANDDIED! (putting some thick condescending emphasis on my name).  
ME: Umm, yes. How can I help you?

LADY: I'm in Hawaii! (Okay, definitely not a customer) I open up my laptop and I see your name everywhere!!  
  
  
Quick side note here. I'm relatively new to the company at this point. And a very small part of me, to my retrospective embarrassment, actually considers that *I* did something that not only broke the internet but had my name attached to it.

LADY: Yes. I open up my laptop and I'm looking at these open connections to websites I'm not even on and I see ""$CDN"" everywhere! Why are you on my computer?!!!  
    
To this day, I have no idea what she was looking at. But she's probably seeing our CDN in the hostnames of her internet history or something. After a sigh of relief I explained to her what was likely going on. Her tone changed immediately, and started asking a few followup questions. it was a quiet day so I took a few minutes to give her a walkthrough of how the internet works, and how CDNs factor in. Aside from her eventually asking how to not use CDNs, it was actually a pretty pleasant discussion by the end.

Radijs,Techie techie what now?,"I'm still processing this. Before the weekend I got an email from a user who couldn't log in to the HR portal, these calls are far from unique, loads of people forget their login data and ""Forgot password"" has too many syllables for these people to read so they immediately mail tech support.

I start off by telling her to click the ""Forgot password"" link and follow the instructions. She soon returns another e-mail that the password retrieval option isn't working.  
Unfortunately this is, once again not that uncommon. The HR system requires you to answer a secret question in order to mail you a new password.  
So I reset her password manually and inform her that she's gotten her new password and instructions on how to set her own in her e-mail.

The weekend passes and this morning I got a new e-mail:

curtludwig,We are French!,"Background: I was lead support tech for a company supporting mostly television stations. Often I would make onsite visits but one time I was busy on something else so we sent a junior co-worker hereafter known as **$JCO**. Smart guy but new to onsite work.  

Customer is a French (from France I mean) television network in the US. They are complaining that their PCs come on and work fine for half an hour but then need to be shut off and restarted every half hour or they blue screen. 

**$JCO** calls me later that day, it turns out the editors all smoke in the edit suites and the ashtray sits right in front of the PC. He opens a machine to figure out whats wrong with it and cigarette ash literally flows out of the side of the computer. The PC fan has been sucking in ash and filling the case.

Fortunately **$JCO** is also a smoker, I'm not sure I could have handled this.

Anyway he takes a couple days to clean the machines out, at the time we REALLY didn't want to do onsite work if we didn't have to so we charged an ABSURD amount for the effort. Que a call with **$JCO**, the customer **$C**, and me **$Me**.

&gt;**$ME**: So **$JCO** has you back up and running but we really need to ensure that nobody smokes in the suites anymore or we'll be doing this job again in 18 months or so.

TheLightningCount1,"Lets willingly violate security policy for convenience, whats the worst that could happen. The FTC. That is what can happen.","Just like last time, all events were true. The spacing, timing, and event orders were changed, rearranged for epic retelling. 

So the next day my task was to simply determine which devices were connected, and where these devices were connected from, and if we had a history with these devices. 

So some of the comments yesterday were geting things a little wrong. When I talked about disappearing loans, these were mortgage loans not yet written. People were stealing potential loans from *our company* with all of the work already done.

If you apply for a mortgage loan using a mortgage company, never go through bank use a mortgage company, you will hear the term ""locking in your rate."" This is because the rates change daily. Sometimes you can lock in your rate and it will go down the next day. Sometimes it will go up the next day. 

What this lady was doing, was hiring and firing people based on things they did not control. She would hire people, treat them like her best friend, take em out to lunch/dinner, get to know them well, and treat them like they are all stars. When someone was unable to lock in a rate in X time, she would let them go. She would do it for people who had no control over it either. If a customer forgot to include X W2 or Y pay stubb, you know the things banks want, then the loans would not get locked in in time. Fired. This created a large number of pissed off former employees. She was a high producer who went through assistants about as fast as I go through sparklets bottles. You get the picture. 

These pissed off users would call up those people who had locked in and would give them a better rate, even though it was locked in, and steal all of the info from our loan software to create a paper loan. They would then submit the loan for the sweet sweet commission on a freelance loan. Which is very significant. 

At this point nothing was shocking me. I would research a user, find out the extent of what they did, and document it while disabling access. After the tenth one where this happened, I get a call within 5 minutes transferred to me. 

&gt; $PU = Panicked user

(by the end of the week) Several more were informed by legal that things were happening.™

This was when the gut check came. The company learned that when you report breaches due to your own incompetence to the police, the FTC comes knocking. 

This started the interviews which , thankfully, i did not have to take part in. Which kicked off the audits, which unfortunately, I was vital to the documentation of.

dongholio,"Sometimes, IT is at fault.","Years ago, I worked for a small company (by small, I mean it had about 6 engineers / machine shop workers, 1 dedicated IT guy, and the owners).  The IT guy was doing this part time, as he was going to school.  He had no certificates, no experience, and basically was hired on because he knew the owners and they thought he was an IT wizard simply because he knew a few command lines and understood how to plug in Plug A into Port A.  He was clearly in over his head, and between the job and his school work, he always seemed to be on the verge of snapping from stress.

One of the machinists apparently got a better offer, so the IT guy went through the motions of deactivating his log on, taking his company badge, and making sure the company laptop / devices were all turned in.  And this is where it got interesting:

&gt;IT:  ""Sir, you have to turn in your cell phone.""  
&gt;Guy:  ""It's my cell phone.""  
&gt;IT:  ""Sir, our records show that the cell phone was issued to you and we've been paying the monthly fees.""  
&gt;Guy:  ""I was never issued a company phone, I've just been using my personal phone for company purposes.  Owner and I agreed that he would pay my phone bill since I saved him the hassle of getting another line.""

Note:  This was in early 2000s, when cell phones still had plans by the minute, you had to sign a year contract, texting and voicemail was extra, and adding a new line wasn't as simple as going online to a website and managing your account.  Anyways, back to the story.

&gt;IT:  ""I'm sorry sir, I can't let you leave without turning over your phone.""  
&gt;Guy:  ""You can do what you want, I'm out.  Call the Owner if you want.""  

Long story short, IT guy and Machinist nearly got into a fistfight (which would have been hilariously one sided, as the Machinist had about 200 lbs of muscle and the IT guy was built like a particularly skinny broomstick), Owners (rightly) sided with the Machinist, and IT guy was let go to ""focus on his studies"", albeit with a good reference.

Twist:  I was the IT guy.  Sometimes, I still cringe at the memories of my own stupidity.",talesfromtechsupport,897,1523032541

$N = Me, the one and only.
$C = Client
$M = Client's manager

So it has been over a year since all culprits ($C and $M) have left the company, so I think it time to share this golden apple with the group. 

It is 12:01pm on a Monday, and the phone system stops working. Customer calls are flooding in to an auto-attendant and are getting ""we're closed"". What kind of business closes during their expected peak time?  

A little context. We'd changed phone providers and some staff obviously preferred the old system. Nevertheless this was a recurring issue I was investigating. 

This is how the conversation goes down:

**$M**: The phone system has stopped working again. There must be some configuration for why it goes down the same time, every day. Get it together and fix this thing.


**$N**: $M I have been looking into this for a while now, and it's just odd that seemingly every time $C goes on lunch, the phone system does into a ""Do Not Disturb Mode"", I believe we're manually triggering this.

So then I hit up the provider of the phone and ask them to do traces to see if the ""DND"" function has been enabled - it had been. I report back to $M and ask him to speak to $C and confirm. Nope. $C swears that they are not putting the phone system into DND. 

It is make or break time. Either $C or $N is about to die. It's EoM and 12:00am. Clockwork, phones go down. I get a good earful from $M about how I am incompetent, and how I need to learn what I am doing. Frustrated I get in contact with the third party and (very) abruptly tell them that within their software, I want the DnD function completely disabled. I then, tell $M that if I see the system in a DND mode again, the blames on $C. 

**$M**: I have had very stern conversations with $C and have been advised that there is no way they're turning DND on. I told them if I see it again they're going to be fired.


**$N**: Good, because at this stage it looks as though $C is simply lying to you. I've scheduled a monitor, and I am over-viewing the call routes now.

So my lunch break was spent going through the call flow diagrams (Oh, Visio how you've improved) and fault it; why on Earth does the calls not overflow to Night-Mode and have it round-robin? It's almost like there is another factor involved. 

**$N**: $M, I had a look at the call logs and there seems to be a slight issue; when DND is enabled it is meant to round-robin to all in this hunt group for 45 seconds.


**$M**: Don't worry $N, since my talk with $C I noticed today phones worked fine. Problem is fixed.


Low and behold, 25 minutes later I get a call and say the phones are down. It's 12:25pm.


**$N**: Where is $C?


**$M**: I think $C just went to lunch, why?


**$N**: Because as soon as $C goes to lunch, the phones stop working. This is ridiculous. I am not sure what they are doing, but it's causing some issue with the system.


So the next day comes around. Last straw, if I don't get this fixed I may as well kiss my job goodbye. I decide to be sneaky, and ""work"" on the PC behind $C. It's 12:00pm and here we go.


**$C**: Going on lunch break $M (presses button on desk phone)


The phones die. I rush to the desk and look at the button ""Divert to Mob"". Why the f**k can a receptionist divert work calls to a mobile!? I call up the phone company on the spot.


**$N**: What the hell does this pre-programmed button do?


(Phone Company checks): It appears to divert a portable phone.


**$N**: What's the routing on that look like?


(Phone Company checks): It goes to EXT. 1243 and if it fails, diverts back to the main number.


I process this. I call the number it diverts to explicitly. It's off. Enraged, I track a spare phone down, register this number, and call again - welcome, it works. 


**$N**: Why was this not detailed in the report for call flows?


(Phone Company): This phone has been off for 2+ months and we assumed not in use. It simply was missed.


I track the phone down. It's in $M desk. Apparently, he's never seen it or knew what it was for.


**$N to $C**: Why do you press this button when you go on Lunch?


**$C**: It puts the calls into DND mode so that they overflow to the next set of phones to be answered.


**$N**: Do you know where they go?


**$C**: Yeah, to the spare phone in $M draw. It's off because I don't want it to disturb me on my lunch break.


**$N**: So what you're telling me is you're aware you've put the phone system into DND even though you said you didn't, you're aware where it diverts to, you know there is an issue when you turn on DND, and you've not thought to tell me?


Right now I am fuming. I have spent 2 weeks being chewed out by 3 managers. I've spent hours upon hours studying documentation and having arguments with the phone company, all because $C didn't want to tell the truth. But wait, there is more.


**$M**: So $N you're telling me you implement this system and you do not know how it works? Why the hell did it take 3 weeks to find this?


**$N**: Believe it or not $M, I actually take care of alot more departments than just yours, and have serious issues to fix. I have spent upwards of 30 hours on this ticket, and have diagnosed everything within documented procedures to try and find this.


&gt; You know what that got me?


**$M**: Who is to blame for it?


**$C**: You can't really blame me for that.

I'm done. Managers not monitoring their staff, system documentation that's not even correct and I am suppose to be a mind-reading all powerful L2 technician. You sure got me. ",talesfromtechsupport,706,1523016383
TheLightningCount1,Hey lets willingly violate security policies because we think we are special and earned it. The final nail in the lax security coffin. Part 1,"So this happened about a year or so ago. The lawsuits finally were settled so I am able to write about it now. Once again timing, spacing, and conversations are embellished for dramatic effect. I do this to make my stories enjoyable. Otherwise they would be boring af. 

A high earner at our company had one of her underlings call into it support with an issue. She was sending on behalf of, instead of sending as user for delegated access. 
 
The tech was told simply that inside citrix it sends on behalf of but outside it sends as...

Took the tech a little bit to put 2 and 2 together but he got to 4 in the end. The reason why it was working outside citrix was because the underling was logging into the high performers account, instead of adding the second mailbox. 

He dug a little deeper and discovered that all of her underlings were logging into her accounts everywhere. Not just outlook. So he wrote up a ticket and passed it along to me after being told that NO they would not change their ways. 

I picked it up and the first thing I did was run a lockout report. This was just so I could gauge how many devices were logging into her account. 42 (actual unembellished number)

Now picture it in your head. Your direct supervisor, the ones who actually do work, picking up the ticket and constantly moving as they check this tool or that tool. Then they just freeze. That was me that day. ""Fourty two devices? Holy sh.... Ok."" 

I call up the lady on the phone. 

&gt; $me = Commander William Adama  
&gt; $UU = Uppity user. Or Tammy 2

&gt; $me - Hello this is $me with IT. I was calling about a situation I had been made aware of. Several people log into your account for the purposes of work correct?  
&gt; $UU - Yes that is right. Because of our high volume we need to be able to quickly respond as me for all situations. This has come up before and I must say that I have fought hard to get this permission and will not let it go.  
&gt; $Me - I need to know how many devices are currently logged into your credentials at this moment. It is a matter of extreme urgency.  
&gt; $UU - Christ really? Hold one. 

*Intermission*

&gt; $UU - 12 devices. 5 PCs including mine. Everyone's phones including mine, an Ipad I own, and the reception PC in the front foyer.  
&gt; $ME - Only 12 devices? I am reading 37 devices at this current moment. Earlier it was at 42.  
&gt; $UU - That is just not possible. The only ones who have my password are the current employees. I have you guys change it every time we get a new one or let one go.  
&gt; $Me - How do we change it? Walk me through the entire process.  
&gt; $UU - I call you guys and have you set it back to what it was before.  

*Long pause.*

&gt; $UU - Hello?  
&gt; $ME - Do you not see the issue here? Do you not see what you have done?  
&gt; $UU - What do you mean?  
&gt; $ME - I have your tickets pulled up here in the system. You have submitted several requests to us about disappearing loans in your system. You have directly asked us before if people could be stealing your loans. And right now you tell me you never change your password. You call in and tell us what you would like it changed to. Do you not see why this is happening?  
&gt; $UU - When you change the password in our system it makes you put it back into all of the devices so it cant be that.  
&gt; $Me - First off no it does not. Second off, even if it did all they would have to do is put the same freaking password back in anyways.  
&gt; $UU - Oh...  
&gt; $Me - Yeah your branch is down. I am locking all of your accounts for now and we have to get infosec involed. I am sorry but it is out of my hands.  

I get up from my desk, which was at the old building, and I walk into my boss's office who was in a meeting with the EVP of IT, the CIO, and the accounts team supervisor. 

""Oh good. You are all here.""

This was how I interrupted their meeting to relay the information. In the movies, no one ever really truly captures the look of horror that slowly creeps into the faces of those who come upon the realization of terrible news. 

Unlike before in my past stories, this was not a security loophole, this was not a breach through intrusive means, this was merely a self important uppity user who thought they were above the law, so to speak, because they were a high performer.  Thankfully they were from a branch that was only 2 miles away, so we were able to head this one off at the pass in terms of limiting their ability to gripe to the correct people to get their accounts turned back on. 

This day was a bad day for me in the terms of management. And a worse day in terms of paperwork. I never had to fill out legal forms before...

miscreancy,What do you mean I have to do it myself?,"A tale from my very early days working for $GiantSupermarketChain on their helpdesk - first post, so be gentle

Your cast of characters:

**$Miscreancy**: A dashing ne'er-do-well, new to working in tech support and tech generally

**$LadyMacbeth**: a customer working for $GiantSupermarketChainBank, who expected us to jump to her every command


The tale begins!


*So this was in my first few weeks manning the help desk for $GiantSupermarketChain - we were first line support for all IT issues that didn't relate to POS. My team ($Office) handled office-based colleagues, as opposed to the $Stores team that handled - you guessed it - colleagues based in store (those were the worst kind of calls). We also had responsibility for handling all calls related to $GiantSupermarketChainBank, whose colleagues were convinced they were the most important people we would ever speak to in our day, regardless of grade.*


The call goes a little something like this:

**$Miscreancy**: Good afternoon, you're through to $Miscreancy on the $Office team, how can I help?

**$LadyMacbeth**: Hello, it's my last day here with $GiantSupermarketChainBank. I thought I'd be nice to the person coming through and order them a new keyboard and mouse as I'm now leaving and I'll be taking them with me.


**$Miscreancy**: (in head) so she must have provided her own... right?


**$Miscreancy**: (out loud) okay, so you'll need to fill in the equipment request form to request any equipment, we're a helpdesk here for technical issues. Just to confirm you've been using a mouse and keyboard from home this whole time?

**$LadyMacbeth**: No, but this keyboard and mouse were bought for me by the company as I have $CommonWristProblem, so I can take them with me when I go.

**$Miscreancy**: I'm sorry, it sounds to me like those are company property that have been provided for you to enable you to do your job without any health impact; as such they should be returned to $Hardware team when you leave so they can be provided to any other colleague at $Site who has or develops $CommonWristProblem. Has a member of $Hardware team told you you can take these with you when you go?

**$LadyMacbeth**: No, but my manager has and he outranks any member of $Hardware team! They're mine and I'm taking them!

**$Miscreancy**: I'm afraid your manager doesn't have the authority to hand resources that belong to another team to a member of his team; it would have been $Hardware's budget that paid for this equipment and all IT equipment is under their jurisdiction.


(By this point I am already IMing $Hardware's manager on that site to let them know someone is about to walk out with what sounds like expensive peripherals)


**$LadyMacbeth**: But we outrank them! We're $GiantSupermarketChainBank, our calls and issues are a priority.

**$Miscreancy**: We treat you the same as we do callers from $GiantSupermarketChain, actually. And this isn't an issue for my team to handle. You've called me to try and order equipment, which you need to submit via a form, and have since informed me that you are planning to walk out with specialist equipment that's been provided to you. All calls to our desk are recorded and I have informed $Hardware team of this as well. Can I suggest you talk to them regarding this as I believe you need to hand that equipment back?

**$LadyMacbeth**: I'm walking out the door in a minute, I don't have time to fill in a form.

**$Miscreancy**: (trying to get this through to her) Well as you need to leave the equipment anyway, if you give me your desk number I can just give that to $Hardware and they'll swap it over for a standard set of peripherals for the new colleague coming in, as that doesn't involve ordering anything in theory we can skip the form that way.

**$LadyMacbeth**: But I'm not leaving them, they're mine!


By this point I am ready to drive up to $Site myself and deal with her... except it would take 6 hours.


**$Miscreancy**: I have to inform you having spoken to $Hardware's manager over IM, we're in agreement that this equipment is company property and you don't have authorisation to take it off site. Please visit $Hardware team in $Site and hand the equipment back prior to leaving.

**$LadyMacbeth**: No, they're mine! HONESTLY your team is absolutely useless, I don't know why I bothered calling, you don't know anything.

[$LadyMacbeth hangs up]


I think nothing of this at the time, but the next week we get a feedback email from $Hardware's manager:

In addition we'd like to thank $Miscreancy for identifying a potential theft situation last week - we had to stop the colleague at the exit and reclaim the peripherals she was trying to take. Those cost around £250 out of our budget and frequently go missing when people leave, so we always appreciate the chance to stop them being taken. This colleague's manager has also been informed of our policy around hardware and future losses from his team will be charged from his budget.

The moral of the story: just because the company has provided it for you, doesn't make it yours.

tl;dr: Woman tried to leave the company and take custom expensive peripherals, was told they were company property, tried to do it anyway.

TechieYoda,"""Skype quality poor, fix it""","Reading another TFTS tale reminded of this gem.

For reference, at the time I worked IT for the C suite of a large company. I would regularly visit CEO's office and his 4+ admins.

Even though at this company we had enterprise video conference tools like Zoom and Skype for Business, the CEO had a preference for plain old Skype since it had been 'successful in the past.'

^Side ^note: ^before ^my ^arrival, ^the ^first ^use ^case ^of ^non-Skype ^failed ^miserably...

That is until one day when he's in his private conference room and has a bad call.

As standard practice, prior to any video conference, our team would test with the end user or their admin without fail to ensure the system was 100% and address any issues, if needed.

CEO emails CIO with subject ""Skype quality poor, fix it"". No additional details. Thankfully, we already knew which call it had been. As usual, we had tested the day before with the user and it had worked beautifully.

CEO had another Skype call with the same user in a few weeks time so we started troubleshooting...

Test call 1: primary office and another local office. No issues

Test call 2: primary office and an office on the East Coast - issue on East Coast, which was addressed. Follow up test: no issues.

Test call 3: primary office and an office close to $user's location. No issues.

At this point we're thinking *we have no issues, must be other end* and report so to CIO. CIO passes this info to CEO, and also asked us to retest with end user a day before their meeting, as usual, and report back.

Test call 4, day before the call: test is perfect, no issues.

Test call 5, day of call: another test just an hour before actual call was perfect, no issues.

Two hours later: email from CEO ""Skype still not working""

CEO is looking to take someone's head off at this point...
and the CIO made it clear that it would not be his head.

Que testing to save my as...calls with local and another office were perfect so we deem the issue must be on $user's end.

Then it dawns on me to email the other end's admin:
&gt; Hi $admin,

&gt; $CEO indicated poor quality during their call again yesterday. We had tested the meeting and everything was perfect. Was there by chance any change in the setup before the call?

&gt; Thanks,

&gt;TechieYoda

Email reply from admin:

&gt; Hi TechieYoda

&gt; No, $enduser just took his laptop to $restaurant/cafe for the call as usual.

&gt; Best,

&gt; $admin

**Eureka!**

&gt; $CIO

&gt; Based on our testing, and user input, we have identified the culprit of the poor quality calls: $restaurant/cafe's wifi network. Per $admin's note below, $user has a tendency to video conference from $restaurant/cafe instead of their office. 

&gt; Best,

&gt; TechieYoda

ITSupportZombie,Your tantrum will not help you.,"At my previous job, I worked customer support for a corporate headquarters.  Many of my users were extremely entitled and felt the need to abuse everyone they perceive to be beneath them.  In this case, there was a crazy old lady ($COL) who liked to play dumb to get others to do her job whenever possible.  As many of you know that anything IT related is black magic and wizardry.  In this case I had frequent issues for even the most simple of things (like forgetting where the send button is on outlook when we upgraded to office 2013), she was always hostile and abusive even when asking for a favor.  This time was no different.

On this day around 2pm, $COL walks into my office and demands that I decrypt some files and put them in her shared folder before I go home.  I politely tell her that I am booked out for the rest of the day and that I have previously shown her how to unpack a file in 7zip.  She immediately starts shouting about how unhelpful I am and how lazy my whole department is.  I once again remind her that this falls outside my scope and is part of her duties.

She angrily storms out of my office, once again repeating her demand that she better have this by close of business that day.

I put the disks with the data on them aside and continue working on the projects that are an actual part of my job and if not done, could cause many users to not be able to work.  Within minutes, I have pushed her tantrum out of my mind.

A few hours later, I am working after hours on a call with a vendor to resolve an issue with a piece of hardware that is malfunctioning.

Through my door comes an enraged $COL hurling accusations and demands in her usual style, insulting my quality of work, ability to do my job and my beard.  I calmly tell her that I am on a call with a vendor and will work on her disks midday the next day when I have the time blocked out.  $COL isn’t having it.  Her rage devolves into an unintelligible foot stomping, arms waving tantrum you would normally expect to see a child in a grocery store have when they are told they can’t have any candy.  

I ignore her and go back to my call.  Fixing this is kind of a big deal.

The tantrum continues for a good 7-8 more minutes until my patience finally gives way.

I stand up from my desk, point to the door and tell her to get out of my office if she ever wants my assistance again.  To my surprise, she shuts up and walks out.  I should have known this was too easy.

After she left, she walked into my boss’ office and proceeds to scream and shout at him.  He is on a very important conference call too and she would not leave his office.  He (I am told) got up and shut his door in her face.

Hearing her shouting down the hall, I assumed that this was the thing that would get me fired.

Note:  My boss at the time hated me.  He was looking for an opportunity to fire me, but couldn’t find something good enough because the users in this building loved me and I was hired by his boss (the CIO) from when I worked for him previously.  I was loyal to getting my job done the best I possibly could and did not play office politics, especially did not play them the way $boss wanted.

After I get off my call, I pack up to leave for the day when $boss walks in.  He asks, with a tone of disbelief, what happened.  I told him in very professional terms what had happened.  $boss then tells me what he did and was glad I was in the right on this.  I am shocked that for the first time ever, he is taking my side.  I take this as my que to leave, I am nearly at the 12 hour mark for my day.

The next morning I have an angry email from $COL’s bosses boss ($COLBB) detailing $COL’s version of the story.  I proceed to $COLBB’s office to have this conversation face to face.  I explain the events and prior history to her in great detail, including my personal notes from each incident.  $COLBB asks for and I provided copies of my notes.  I am then politely, but firmly, dismissed.

A few days later I am told that she not only has to submit a ticket for all work (which I have 3 business days to resolve), but she is not allowed to contact my office directly and any personal interactions between her and my office must have a senior person there to be a witness.

White_Noise_83,Let's cc in the boss - that'll get IT off their lazy ass...,"Long time IT manager, first time post...  

Yesterday I received an email from a staff member (cc their manager) saying that the email address for one our shared mailboxes is not working any longer.  It was accompanied by the NDR.   
Yesterday was a busy day for me, so when I saw it, I knew what the issue was straight away - they were using address.email@domain.com instead of the long standing email.address@domain.com - but I couldn't do anything at the time because I was working on more important things.  And I thought to myself ""they'll figure it out"".

Anyhow - I received a follow-up email this morning which this time had the company director cc'd into the email.  It went on to say that I hadn't responded yet and that it was of paramount importance that the issue be resolved as soon as possible because they were providing this email address to clients and receiving feedback that the client couldn't send emails to the company.

It hadn't even been 24hrs and the user had made zero effort themselves.  But whatever, I logged onto Exchange Online, added the incorrect email address as another alias to the shared mailbox and took a screenshot.  I clicked Reply All to the latest email and gently explained her error and also informed her that I've added the incorrect email address to the mailbox so it would now work and that if the same mistake was made in future, those emails would also deliver.  I pasted in my screenshot of the mailbox addresses clearly showing the primary email address and the newly added alias.

10 minutes later I received the standard ""I had been told that was the email address"" but this time there was no cc's.

Newbosterone,Bureaucracy is Like Thor's Hammer -,"You always want to be on the swinging end, not the receiving end.

The ticket came in ""Cannot Install *CrucialSystemPackage*"", high priority, from our Middleware team.  This can either be a good thing or a bad thing; for the most part, they know their job very well; however, they sometimes don't know *my* job.

From the ticket description: ""I'm trying to run yum update *DefinitelyASystemPackage* and I'm getting these errors.  You guys need to set up yum correctly.""  This team has sudo access, so they can update the parts of the system they own, but this isn't one of those parts.  The error message also indicates they're trying to get this package from some random mirror on the internet, rather than one of the local repositories on the intranet.

I contact the submitter via chat.  It's the beginning of my day, but the end of his.  That might explain the attitude I got from him.  ""Do this; I'm in a hurry; your system is broken; it shouldn't be set up like that"".

I always try to figure out what the user is trying to do, and why; what he wants is often distantly related.

When I get to the root of the problem, he's misunderstood an error message from the web server, and thinks he should update my OS component.  Being a user, he doesn't believe me, and is fixated on his solution.

I google his error message, cut and paste the solution in the chat, and ask him if he has tried that.  He said he had not, but would so I would get on with fixing my system.  Behold, the fix took 60 seconds, and worked.

Then my day got much, much sweeter.

Me:  ""This is a production system, has the outage been resolved?""

Them:  ""Oh, there was no outage, I just didn't like that error message.  It wouldn't ever cause an outage"".

Me:  ""And you didn't try this fix in dev or test first?""

Angelin01,If it needs power...,"LTL, FTS. Here's a quickie, fresh out of the oven:

I'm an intern in a government building, working on the support side. Let's just say the rules here are: no rules.

*phone rings*
&gt; $me: Good morning, tech support speaking.  
&gt; $caller: Hello, do you guys have a 3 way adapter? We need to power this thing but are out of sockets!  
&gt; $me: Uhm... I don't believe we have any adapters, I'll check.  

So I get suspicious. When we set up computers, they are ready to go and powered, connected to the network, etc. Why would she need a 3 way splitter?
&gt; $me: Sorry, no adapters... What do you need it for? Is it urgent?  
&gt; $caller: Well, it's because we need to power this fridge here, otherwise these foods will rot, and TI should have adapters!  
&gt; $me: Sorry, we can't help you... You should try calling the storeroom folks.

DatIzzy,"End User deletes $5,000 and asks us to pay up","**Inciting Incident**

*December, 20XX. Client is having an error message on their registers, caused by a corrupt file. This is solved by deleting a specific file, one that, by chance, stores offline credit card transactions! Since this is actual sales, it's important that a copy of this file be made in advance, just in case there are sales to replay. Due to timezone difference, time constraints, and the end-user not wanting to do a phone call, a brief back-and-forth discussion happens, ending thusly:*


&gt;$DatIzzy: ""Hey, so I know you're having $Issue again. I've emailed you the instructions on how to do this, though I'm sure you're familiar with all the other times we've done this. Please remember to copy that file onto a flash drive! Those are important sales information, and will be lost if a copy isn't made.""  
&gt;$Aurelia: ""There's nothing in the file anyway. I'll just delete it.""  
&gt;$DatIzzy: ""I'll need a copy of the file regardless, for record purposes.""

*March, 20XX+1. Sitting in a small meeting room, $DatIzzy is leaning back. His internship was almost up, and he had to deliver the unpleasant news that $HospitalChain was canceling their support contract with us. $BigCompany was still going to offer other services, but they effectively used us to test out the system that they insisted on, that was never deployed before them and no one deployed after. The thing was undocumented, unique, and not even the $DeploymentGuys had a solid idea of how to troubleshoot.*

*Which meant this was fun...*

&gt;$Coworker: ""Right. So, I've got a ticket for $Hospital. They're having some credit card reconciliation problems...""  
&gt;$Manager: ""Well, maybe $DatIzzy should look at it...""  
&gt;$DatIzzy: ""Coworker actually knows there stuff here. What I can say is that their POS' haven't sent out the sales. They've been having some trouble in the past with them, but they've stopped contacting us. What site is it, and when?""  
&gt;$Coworker: ""$SpecificLocation, back from December, and they say they're missing $5,000.""

-------------

**Context**

I work at $BigCompany, offering support for Point of Sales (POS) devices. We also end up supporting peripherals (scanners, scales, receipt printers, etc.) as well as related websites. However, I've managed to wiggle into credit card reconciliation, which makes me feel like a low-risk Sherlock Holmes. Back then, it's because there was a sort of a thrill to the chase, so-to-speak. Now... well, now it's because I can diagnose most issues at a glance, and be insufferable about it.

This is a tale from my early career in IT, around the 6-month mark. I still wore dress shirts, though had dropped the tie. I had dress shoes. I worked hard to get here, and I was gunning to be brought on full-time!

**The Cast**

$Me: $DatIzzy. Yours truly.  
$AU: $Aurelia, manager at two properties for $HospitalChain. Since they both had the same issue, they're just getting lumped together here.  
$MA: $Manager. Nice guy. Didn't entirely understand what I was doing, but knew to trust the people that were actually doing the jobs.

-------------

**The Issue**

Missing funds are a serious matter, but my group isn't responsible for making sure the field properly reconciles. At least, not anymore. Back at the time of the story, it was my job to reconcile for them as part of the troubleshooting process. At the time it was only about three month's worth of information, for two properties. The information collection process is, well, slow. First, I need to go to $ReportingWebsite to find out what the registers actually recorded day-by-day. Then, I need to go into $Program to see what was actually sent out. Finally, I need to go to $SettleWebsite to see what actually got sent to their bank. Between those three, I can manage to find some trends. If $Program has more or less money than $ReportingWebsite, then there was an issue with the registers for instance. If $ReportingWebsite and $Program are the same but $SettleWebsite is off, then either transactions were rejected (if short) or there might be duplicated transactions (if over). $ReportingWebsite takes the longest, due to some clunky UI, website instability, and that, to make sure I don't need to pull this information again, I save a copy of every day for each location. Needless to say, it took me most of the workweek to get this done, because, of course, I still have other issues to work on...

Lo and behold, they're missing... less than $5k, but close enough that I can excuse it being a shorthand. And I can pinpoint days as well. The problem with the high-level view, of course, is that it's high-level: I can pinpoint when the issues are, but not what the exact issue is for each day! So I dig in. This takes me about another day.

It's a full week after I've looked up all this information. I've got hundreds of reports saved, some text documents and others PDF's. I've got my spreadsheet looking... well, passable. I call $Aurelia.

&gt;$Me: ""Hi, this is $Me from $BigCompany. I'm calling in recards to $Ticket?""  
&gt;$AU: ""Oh, thank god! I've been waiting! So, you're going to write us a check, right?""  
&gt;$Me: ""We need to find out why the funds haven't transferred, first. Now, I can see that there are a number of offline transactions...""  
&gt;$AU: ""Our transactions are always online. We wouldn't take any offline!""  
*This is not an uncommon reaction. The term ""offline transaction"" does conjure up a certain scenario, but the truth of the matter is that it's a shorthand term. In reality, a transaction is taken in an offline state when the registers are offline, the credit card reader is offline, or when there are sufficient delays in communication.*  
&gt;$Me: ""As we've discussed before, your network isn't really up to snuff. Have you contacted $LocalIT to investigate the matter?""  
&gt;$AU: ""They said everything's fine! No problems. So, when can we expect the money?""  
&gt;$Me: ""Right, so there's a large number of offline transactions that make up almost the entirety of the loss. These don't seem to have been replayed...""  
&gt;$AU: *She sighs in annoyance, the sound of someone begrudgingly going with the flow to say ""I told you so"" later.* ""Fine. What do you need me to do?""

*A call is scheduled during their slow time, which, coincidentally, is when my day is almost over due to the timezone difference. Still, I'm more than happy to provide this service. Some extra effort getting this missing money will be a boon! I wasn't even thinking of what would happen if the sales got declined or, worse, if transactions actually made it through...*

&gt;$Me: ""ALright, now I just need you to follow $Step1, $Step2...""  
&gt;$AU: ""I've already done it. It's not there.""  
&gt;$Me: ""Not there? Huh, that's wei- Steps? Oooh, right, I provided you those steps!""  
&gt;$AU: ""Oh, you did?"" *Her voice, for once, warms up, as if appreciative.* ""Yeah, these worked great! Really helped us resolve our issue, since you guys took too long, and weren't fixing it anyway.""  
&gt;$Me: ""What other issues? Did you open tickets? Did you ever send in the copies of those files?""  
&gt;$AU: ""Oh, no, you guys always took so long. And they were always empty! So we just started deleting the files every day.""  
&gt;$Me: ""I... you... What?"" *Smoke comes out of $DatIzzy's ears. This would ruin his chance at a job! A good job! Not in a kitchen! A desk, and air conditioning, and a livable wage he could move out on!* ""We... we need to look at all of the registers. Period.""  
&gt;$AU: ""But this one-""  
&gt;$Me: ""Every. Single. Register.""

*Each property only had a couple of POS' each, so it was quick per site, with the major delay being the drive between the two. As it turns out, $Aurelia had indeed just been deleting the files. Now, that wasn't the end of the world, because instead of using compact flash memory and a modified version of an older windows like the rest of our POS', theirs had Windows 7 and an HDD. This meant that deleted items actually went to the Recycling Bin...*

&gt;$Me: ""So, is anything in there?""  
&gt;$AU: ""No! I didn't want those files corrupting anything else on my register!""

*Knowing this was a situation of one person's word against another's, $DatIzzy considered himself to be up a well-known creek without a paddle. The only way to get in front of this potential storm was to fess up, throwing myself at $Manager's mercy.*

&gt;$Me: ""Right. So, they were having $Problem, but they started to get impatient. I sent them written instructions on how to fix it, and gave them the $Warning. Instead of opening up new tickets, they handled it themselves. It also seems that they cleared their Recycling Bin, and since those files are deleted it means the only record has been wiped, so they can't recover their sales.""  
&gt;$MA: ""And they admitted this?""  
&gt;$Me: ""Er... yes, actually. I don't have it in writing, but-""  
*My manager calls $Aurelia up immediately. It runs through the same sort of conversation flow: we need our check, this is your fault, you need to rectify this...*  
&gt;$MA: ""So, $DatIzzy told me that you deleted those files and didn't send them to us. Is that correct?""  
&gt;$AU: ""Yes.""  
&gt;$MA: ""$DatIzzy also told me you didn't open tickets for those times. Is that correct?""  
&gt;$AU: *She's getting increasingly annoyed, wanting nothing to do with silly things like confirming details.* ""Yes!""  
&gt;$MA: ""And you didn't send those files into us to check them?""  
&gt;$AU: ""For the last time, **YES!**""  
&gt;$MA: ""Alright. So, we're going to close this ticket because we can't help you. You deleted those sales without informing us of the problem or letting us confirm, so we're afraid this is your responsibility.""  
*At this point, I was waved off as my manager's manager was brought into the fold, and a liaison, and I got to walk away only slightly less worried than I had been.*

--------------

**The Aftermath**

$Aurelia and $HospitalChain did continue to pester us to write them a check. The latter does make sense -- it was a $BigCompany employee that was the cause of them not getting their sales, although, to be honest, I'm not sure if they were given the full rundown or not. From $Aurelia's standpoint, I like to imagine that she was on the hook for it all. She kept opening tickets up in an attempt to get something done, but we simply referenced $Ticket and closed it out, stating that a decision had been made. It's bad enough that $BigCompany wasn't going to get its cut of those sales, but to write out a check for the missing funds on top of that would've still been worse.

I was ultimately brought on full-time as well. I don't know if this incident had anything to do with it. Honestly, I'd like to think that it was my hard work that brought me on. Though, this even did teach me a couple of important lessons at the end of my internship:  
1) An end-user armed with knowledge isn't always better.  
2) Keep everything documented.

TL;DR: Read the title.",talesfromtechsupport,1994,1522688601
blulitangel,"""Do u know what Minecraft is?""","So first off, I hope I qualify as tech support. I do a tiny bit of support at my day job when the normal support is overwhelmed, but I'm not full time or anything. In fact, this story didn't even happen at my job.
  
  
A little bit of background...
A number of years back when Windows 10 and UWP first came out, I wrote a small flipbook-style app to get familiar with the platform. I listed it for $0.99 and, between normal installs and too many free promotions, managed to make about $100 off of &gt;1,000 installs. And then it sat as I moved on to other things. Fast-forward a few years to just about a half-year ago now and I decided it was time to update the thing. The old version was very outdated, and I'd learned enough about the platform that I felt I could make the update worth my time. So I did. I also made the app free. And people seemed to like the update. Until a week ago.
  
  
There's an issue I've been seeing crop up which causes the app to crash. As far as I can tell, it's a problem with how Windows handles files, and I haven't yet found a workaround. It's not a really frequent issue, but frequent enough to be worrying. And I finally got hit for it by a bad review. Fair enough.
  
  
$Frodo = reviewer
  
  
$Frodo's review (not sic): ""I was drawing and making a picture of a Xbox 360 and fighting and it blew up and the guy flew into space saying FUUUUUUUUU and then the app crashed and my drawing was lost fix your bull\*\*\*\* blulitangel!!!""
  
  
Ok, I can get that it's frustrating to lose your work. However, this read an awful lot like other fake reviews I've seen. I can't really say what exactly about it sounds fake, you just learn to tell, I guess. No matter, I've made a habit of responding to any review under 5 stars, offering support if needed or asking for any suggestions that could make it 5 stars for the user. So I responded: ""Hi $Frodo, so sorry to hear about the crash! It's frustrating when work is lost like that! If you send an email to me@email.com, I'll do my best to help see if the files are recoverable."" The thing is that if the user saved the project at any point, the files should still be on disk and recovering them not a problem.
  
  
I didn't expect a reply. I've never, in the years I've been responding to reviews, gotten a reply. But this time I did. I was sound asleep when, in the middle of the night, I got two emails:
  
  
$Frodo: ""It's alright! 😊❤😆""
  
$Frodo: ""Whats ur phone number btw? i know your email but not ur phone number.""
  
  
When I woke up and saw the emails I wasn't quite sure what to think or what to reply. I thought about it for a while and finally decided to just press ahead with trying to recover $Frodo's files.
  
  
$blulitangel: ""Hi $Frodo, &lt;Explained the issue and that the files may be recoverable if he'd saved the project at all.&gt; Unfortunately I'm not comfortable handing out my phone number, as I'm sure you can understand.""
  
  
$Frodo: Subject: ""??"", Body: ""Do u no what Minecraft is?""
  
$Frodo: Subject: ""???"", Body: ""What's your YouTube channel??????????????""
  
$Frodo: Subject: ""I never saved I was working on my drawing."", Attachment: A selfie of what I'd say is a 7-10 year old boy sitting in what looks like a car.
  
  
By now I'm getting a little.... concerned. I decided to just ignore the first two emails and try to wrap up the conversation.
  
  
$blulitangel: ""Unfortunately if you did not save the project then the files were never written to the disk. I apologize for the headache! I'm doing my best to figure out a workaround for the crash.""
  
  
$Frodo: ""💞💞💞💞💞💞""
  
  
Needless to say, I did not respond to that. I'm hoping that's the end of the conversation, but somehow I'm not quite sure it is.

So I work for a small company in databases/applications ; let's call my company ""Oignon Inc"" for now on.

I once had an old customer calling me to discuss what went wrong on his application.

We had a long talk, as he was not really a computer person ; as he seemed to have a long list of things to change in his application, I just told him to send me an email with the list of things to change. He has been our customer for quite a while, so I assumed that he had my email address.

2 days later, the guy phones again. He doesn't understand that I didn't replied. I tell him that I never got his email.

Turns out he didn't knew my name, just my first name (Vincent). So this guy just sent his email to :

**TL;DR** Angry PR lady threatened to make me personally pay for a plane ticket b/c she missed her flight. In reality, she did not miss her flight at all and she can't actually do that. It was all recorded and she got threatened with her job. Angry PR lady became nicest person in the company over night.

For those of you that are having a nice, quiet (although boringly slow) Good Friday, I give you the Tale of the Always Angry PR Lady.

**The players involved**

**LK** - Me, the poor, innocent bystander.

**DSTech** - The Desk side tech that originally had the ticket. He’s in a different department and has a manager

**PR** - The evil woman that the devil himself probably hid from. Top person to avoid at all costs unless you were just looking to be kicked

**Lead** - My lead

**Director** - My director and acting manager

**The setting**

*Previous job, many years ago. Working a hybrid call center-desk side gig. Still the FNG. When the actual deskside techs would go home, that’s when I started to be the Call Center/Deskside hybrid guy. As usual, our calls are recorded for training purposes, where `training purposes` means `evidence to get someone fired.` We supported internal employees only for a company that had many offices worldwide. We all worked in the HQ building and supported everyone from the janitor to the CEO. There was roughly 10,000 total with all the other buildings/campuses within the city itself. Also, we had no actual manager for our department at the time, so our director took that role.*

*We had this list of people that we would always secretly hand out to the new people when they finished their 2 week training. Our leads and director knew the list existed, and knew it for the joke that it was. The list was the Top 10 people that you were to ignore calls from if you were having a bad day. The call would roll to the next tech, so it was cool. Someone would handle it. Of course, we never officially did this. ;)*

*Our number 1 person to avoid at all costs on a bad day, happened to work in the PR department. She also had a Blackberry with, and I am not kidding, over 65,000 contacts! BB's are notorious for taking forever to back up and restore on a good day. Never mind a good day with the entire population of Daytona Beach, FL. I’m willing to bet she still does and this was a decade ago. It probably has the population of NYC programmed into by now though.*

**And so it begins**

From here until I come in, all of this info was in the notes/emails of the ticket or relayed to me by **DSTech.** On the day in question, **PR** has gotten another new BB. She is also getting ready to go on a business trip. 

**PR** was told at 8am by **DSTech** that if she wanted to take her new BB with her on her business trip that she needed to get her current BB to him before 10am. **PR** finally calls **DSTech** and gets her BB to him at 1pm and asks if it will be ready by 4pm. **DSTech** tells her that it is highly doubtful and that she should just take her current, working BB. She puts up a fuss about it, gets **DSTech’s** manager involved. **DSTech** is told to just get it done however he can. As always, it fails the first couple of times on backing up her massive amounts of data, and then continues to fail when loading it to the new one. **PR** calls **DSTech** at 4pm asking where her new BB is. He explains the issues and tells her that not only is the new one not ready, but the old one is currently in the middle of a 3 hour back up. If he stops it, there is a chance she could lose all her data. This is a problem b/c she *never backs up her phone to her laptop b/c it is not her job to make sure data is backed up. That's ITs job, not hers.* Her words.

**PR** is pissed and the melt down is brewing nicely now. **PR** sends a number of emails to **DSTech** about how terrible he is. She’s also told him that her flight leaves at 5pm and now she's going to miss it b/c she cannot go without her BB.

Here's where I come in. By this point in the day, I am the only one physically in the office. My lead is working from home, so he's technically there. 

**DSTech** comes to me at 5pm (his shift was 6a-3p) telling me what's going on, gives me the ticket number and says that when her phone is done with the backup, failed or not, take it to her if she is even still in the building. At least that way she will have the BB. The old BB finishes at 5:30 and I start calling **PR**. She never answers so I leave a VM. Call again at 6, 6:15 and 6:30. Left VMs each time, updated notes in ticket each time. I leave at 7 and I'm not planning on waiting around on her wrath. If 7 gets here and I haven’t heard from **PR**, then oh well.

At 6:45, she calls me directly, and she is 10 different kinds of pissed off. She's mad b/c original tech went home and won’t answer her calls or emails, she pissed b/c I told her that the only phone that was done was her old BB. She pissed b/c she has left the building (lies, she was there, b/c caller ID....) and couldn't get her phone. She’s pissed b/c her flight left an hour ago and she's stranded at the airport (more lies). She goes on and on ranting and raving about how we didn’t come get her phone until 1pm, we didn't do what she asked, we never get anything right, someone will be driving to the airport to deliver her phone to her, etc. Typical ""it's always the IT guy's fault"" kind of stuff.

She hangs up on me before I could even say a word. **PR** calls back 5 minutes later saying that she is now in the building (damn, that was a quick 15 mile drive) and is coming to get her phone. Hangs up on me again. She then calls from her desk phone again 10 minute later b/c she can't get through the doors on our floor after leaving the elevator lobby (and people like her is why it's locked down). I told her I would be happy to bring it down to her, or meet her in the lobby. We met in the lobby of her floor, she yanked the phone out of my hand and stormed off to her office.

As I am getting back to my desk to pack up and leave, she calls me again. It's after 7pm now and I am supposed to be off, but figure, WTH. Might was well see what crap she has to say now. She gives it to me for 10 minutes straight. Tells me how this is all my fault that she missed her flight, how I locked her out of her BB causing her to get the password wrong 10 times and getting her BB wiped (when asked what she wanted it set to on her new BB, she wrote in an email ab1234. The password for her old BB was AB1234 and was unchanged) In the time it took me to get on the elevator go up 1 floor and walk to my desk, she had managed to wipe her BB by putting in the wrong password, then spelling out BLACKBERRY with the wrong password 10 times. Instead of asking me to reset it through the server, she nuked it. I can still hear her words to this day. **PR** finally ended the call by saying 

**PR**: &gt;I am Public Relations and I am the face of **Company**! I will be giving your name and department to my director so that he can charge you personally for my plane ticket! You are the reason I have missed my flight! You are the reason I will be late to this important meeting to **Company** and you, Mr. **LK**, will pay for every bit of this!

She then hung up again. In 30 minutes I’ve managed to say *Tech support, this is LK* to her 3 times and *Here is your Blackber...*. All I could think after that last phone call was *No, you work in PR, have an assistant as toxic as you are and no, in fact, you can't actually do that.* I'm kinda glad she hung up on me, I didn't get a chance to tell her how big of a bitch she was. Which I am 80% sure I could have gotten away with at that point.

At 730, I called **Lead**, explained everything to him b/c I knew this was going to blow way up the ladder before it was over and told him I was going home. He told me to log an hour of OT and come in an hour late to make up for the trouble. He said he'd get the phone guys to pull all the recording from her phone to our department and the original techs department for the entire day and see what all she said.

Fast forward a week or so. **PR** calls and I get her call on my phone. I *somewhat* loudly exclaim that **PR** LADY IS CALLING ME AGAIN!!!! ARGH!! **Director**, whose office is next to my cube, hears this and comes out. He waits until I hang up and asks 

&gt;**Director**: How was **PR’s** attitude. 

&gt;**LK**: Surprisingly pleasant. Why do you ask? What did you do? 

&gt;**Director**: If she is ever the least bit rude to anyone in *department*, let me know. 

He then smiled and walked into his office without saying another word. I found out later that day from **LEAD** that **LEAD**, **Director**, **PR**, **PR-Manager** and **PR-Director** all had a come to Jesus meeting earlier that morning. It turns out that

* She did not miss her flight. It left at 9pm that night (she did cut it close though, but that was after her telling everyone she had already missed it)
* Her phone was wiped, but she admitted to continuing to put in the wrong password and not asking us to reset it before it got wiped 
* She pretty much admitted to everything. Which **Lead** and **Director** said was sad b/c her director had all the phone calls and emails queued up and ready to play/read the moment she denied any of it.

**PR** got written up and given a final warning all in one shot. The next one would presumably involve HR, Security, a cardboard box and the front door. From that day until she was transferred to another state, she was the nicest person who ever called.

Newbosterone,Slinky Time: Password Reset,"On dark days, I remember a coworker's advice: ""Users are like Slinkys. They serve no useful purpose, but it's fun to give them a little push off the top stair"".

tl;dr - *Password Resets are a secret test to see if users are too dumb to be allowed on a computer.*


I have a few candidates for the Slinky treatment. To set the stage, one of the metrics we're graded on is ""Reopened Tickets"". Our target is pretty low, say 1 in 100. Some tickets don't count, which we refer to as the ""user is an idiot"" loophole: user reopens ticket to ask for something complete different, more information, or say ""Thanks!"". Because managers watch the metric and discuss it weekly, when the ticket is complete, we ask the user if the ticket can be closed and try to head off any problems.  4 times this month, I've had a ticket reopened. In the previous 12 months, I had 1 ticket reopened: ""Thanks! This Really Fixed it!"". 

Waiting on a vendor to get back to me, so I grab a simple ticket from the queue:  ""Please Reset my Password"".  Most password resets are self-service, or done by level-one, but this is a legacy application they don't ~~like~~ handle.

I reset the password and account expiration; in about half these tickets, the user's password has expired since they haven't logged in in 60 days.

In our standard process, the temporary password is sent to the user in an email from the Incident management software.  I always end the email with ""Please let me know if I can close this ticket"" or something similar.  If they reply to the email, it's automatically logged to the ticket.  I also set the status of the ticket to ""Waiting on Customer"".  It doesn't stop the clock, but the system will email the user daily until they update the ticket.

There was no contact from user after 3 daily attempts so I closed the ticket on the 4th day.

3 days later the user reopens ticket, ""Please advise new Password"".   Arrrgh!  Sent him the new password again, and added it to the ticket.  Since it's set to required changing on login, this is allowed.  Set the ticket to ""Waiting on Customer"".  A day later, he responds - ""Thanks, it works"".


The kicker - He created the same ticket a couple of days later. I set the **same** temp password, sent it via email, and put it in the ticket. That's allowed, since it is set to change-on-first-login. No contact after three attempts, on the fourth attempt ""What is new password?"". Emailed him, CC'd his manager:

    Password is 12345, as reported in the first three emails and documented in the ticket. 
    You will have to change it the first time you log in.

I wanted to say ""Password Test Failed.  Please Report to Soylent Green, Inc.  for Processing"".


*I submitted these as a table, and it was rejected as ""Not A Story"".  Let's see if these work in narrative form.*",talesfromtechsupport,750,1522421395
lucariomaster2,"Apparently, I don't know how to use a computer.","I work at the computer help desk for the university I go to.

This morning, we had a professor come in with her laptop, saying that it was stuck in Airplane mode. Okay, no problem, should be a simple fix. I go to the Wireless settings, and see that the Airplane Mode switch is indeed on, but also greyed out. I figure that it needs admin rights to change, which she didn't have since it's a university-owned laptop. I write up a simple ticket to escalate to her departmental support (i.e. the person who has admin rights), and she leaves the laptop with us for the time being as per standard procedure.

Anyway, about 20 minutes later, the admin comes by, and I bring out the laptop so that he can enter the password. He takes one look at it... and flips the switch on the front of the machine.

A message immediately pops up on the screen: ""Airplane mode disabled.""

Needless to say, when I called back the client to say that her laptop was fixed, I thought it wise to leave out the exact details.",talesfromtechsupport,1988,1522346319
texasgunowner12,VIP Support. Why is this corrective action report signed by no one?,"In our company there are people with job titles that are nothing special, but that is by choice. They are so high profile and high producing that they have the CEOs ear. They can walk into the COOs office and tell them what to do. 

One of my techs received a call from one of these VIPs daughter two weeks ago. 

$V2 = VIP's Daughter. Not an employee. 
$Tech = duh
$Me = Texasgunowner12

&gt; $V2 - Hi can you change the password for *VIP* her outlook is not letting her log in.  
&gt; $Tech - Is *VIP* there to confirm that she needs her password changed? I only ask because of security policy.  
&gt; $V2 - No she is 400 miles away giving a presentation. She can only access her outlook inside the VM Ware system. It throws the error on the local desktop.  
&gt; $Tech - Ah ok this is actually a common error. The VM Ware and outlook share the same password. What is likely happening is a corrupt outlook profile on her local PC or credential manager mismatch. If I can connect with *VIP* I can get this fixed in 5 minutes.  
&gt; $V2 - Can I speak with your manager.  
&gt; $Tech - Hold please. *Warm Xfers the call to me* Hey. *VIP's* Daughter on the phone. Sounds like a corrupt outlook profile or credential manager mismatch.  
&gt; $Me - Let me guess she refuses to talk with you?  
&gt; $Tech - Yup. Sending her now.  
&gt; $Me - This is $me with *our company* help desk.  
&gt; $V2 - Yeah my mom needs access to her outlook and she is stating that she has no time for IT to mess with her PC.  
&gt; $Me - Wait... has she been on the phone with you this entire time?  
&gt; $V2 - Yes.  
&gt; $Me - *VIP* Please call me at ext *my number*

No call. No nothing for two days. 

&gt; $ME - Thanks for calling the help desk what can I assist you with today.  
&gt; $V2 - This is *VIPs* Daughter. I need you to reset her password. Outlook is not letting her in. She has to use the VM Ware to access it.  
&gt; $ME - Then nothing is wrong with her password. VM Ware and outlook share the same password.  

She hung up. 

One week later I am informed that a corrective action investigation is being generated on the incident where myself and my tech refused to change the password for a user. 

We were interviewed by two guys form another team as this corrective action investigation involved a supervisor. Normally I would do these. 

We gave them all of the information available and then called the vip themselves and got her fixed. Dont know whether it was a credential manager mismatch or a corrupted outlook profile as the guy who employed the fix wiped credential manager, deleted, and re-added the outlook profile. After reapplying her signatures, he got her back up and running in 5 minutes. 

The report was submitted and a meeting was held between the CIO, me, the tech involed, and some random HR person who said nothing during the entire meeting. 

They went over the original issue, discovered that the fix we suggested weeks ago worked and took less than 10 minutes to fix, and that we never once actually said no. 

&gt; $CIO - And according to the corrective action report it was deemed that *VIP* should have just called into the help desk originally instead of asking her daughter to call. In the future *VIP* is instructed to call the help desk first... So can anyone here tell me why no one signed this report?  
&gt; $me - You already know the answer to that question. No one wants to tell *VIP* that she is wrong. Neither do you.

This garnered a snorting laugh from the HR person. We were dismissed with the promise of both HR person and CIO that this would be buried for a month before being quietly filed. ",talesfromtechsupport,720,1522345777

Someone else can sign up to be notified when they're actually ordered, someone else to be notified when the order is shipped, etc.  Each ""trigger"" can be customized (eg; I only want to be notified if they're ordering something that costs more than $10).

Basically, I do tech support for a website. People call when they have issues or even just questions about their service. 

Customer calls in with an issue they were having in their account, they were getting an error that I couldn't replicate. 

I'm not going to bore you with the details of the call, but the guy was not cooperative during troubleshooting and kept lecturing me about how he builds computers and develops software so he knows what he's doing.

In the end, I needed a screenshot of the error. He said it happened on both his phone and on his computer, but I specifically needed the one from his computer with the URL visible (requirements from the team that the ticket needed to go to, they won't accept the mobile screenshot because in general, the site is not made for mobile and has problems on it).

He refused to give me the screenshot from the computer and kept saying he could give me the one from his phone. I tried to explain why I needed it and he yelled at me:

""YOU CAN'T TAKE A SCREENSHOT ON THE COMPUTER, I CAN GIVE YOU THE ONE FROM MY PHONE!""

Voxmanns,7 Months of Work Cancelled Because People Can't Read.,"I saw a post over on /r/Salesforce where users referenced this subreddit and had to share.

Let's go back to the beginning. I've been at my company for about 1.5 years now and spent the first half trying to figure out how to fit in and the rest of the time cramming to master Salesforce and develop the system so that my team can use them. It's a small company of 10 but we are looking to expand very soon so this is only a little bit important.

Eventually, I proved to the owner and IT guy that I was indeed capable of working as the Salesforce Admin. I put together a 6 month plan to develop Salesforce in phases and gave the usual advice. Training is important, bugs will happen, this should have been done a long time ago so there's going to be some rocky times. I have to say the first 3ish phases went great! I was able to set up the basic lead processes and got pretty much up to winning and fulfilling contracts until it all fell apart.

For the purpose of this story, know that phase 3 involved automation for creating projects and managing opportunity stages (sales cycle stages) and phase 4 was user set up like profiles, roles, permissions, etc.

Phase 3 comes out. It's great. It lasts a whole week and I hear absolutely 0 complaints. A big chunk ended up not even being developed because they took it a different direction (which is great). I told them all through phase 3 and its launch and after its launch that we needed to have people trained or there likely would be problems. But, oh no, it didn't happen then. It waited.

The next week goes by and I begin phase 4. It goes pretty well, a couple bugs but nothing crazy.

The week following (this week) it blows up something fierce. I get in at 9 and by 10:30 these 5 of the 10 people I work with are sending emails and screen caps of errors left and right. I seriously thought something must have gone critically wrong with Salesforce. Keep in mind, I was already trying to resolve an issue from last week regarding a particular users ability to log their time.

I was worried until I got into the errors. A couple were valid errors but didn't take more than an hour to identify and resolve. But the vast majority were training problems. 

""Why can't I edit this record"" because it's in an approval process and set to lock during.

""Why can't I select this stage"" because that's not how you update the stage and you don't even have access to that stage anymore.



But my absolute favorite:

""Why can't I save this task? Here's a screenshot"" while creating a task.

Now, I get it. I did not get the chance to walk them through how to create the task record. But the error message listed the very fields they needed to complete. And they all were lookup fields for related records (that all of them knew and understood) and a single date field that's just a due date for the task.

About this time I lost my mind a bit. I showed the owner who was nearby at the time and his response was laughter and ""good luck with that one"". So, even he knew what had to be done and he's one of the lesser knowledgeable people when it comes to Salesforce.

But, it didn't stop for me there. By this time I am 4 conversations deep trying to train everyone on why the errors are popping up. Just about the time I start to get out of the fire, the other owner gets me on the line. He pulls the plug and tells me to revert everything back to the previous phase because ""The team is overwhelmed with all these new processes and can't handle more processes in Salesforce"".

I didn't fight it. I turned off everything around what they said the problem was. How much is that? 1 approval process. The rest were permission errors that had to be resolved by not rolling back but correcting. I only had to turn off a couple processes dependent on that approval process and those were just automatic record creation or updating. 

The real kicker? Phase 4 was the last stage for basic processes. Had they given me the time and access to train the team (which could have been done in less than 30 minutes for Sales and 30 for Production/Finance) all of this would very likely have been avoided or at least easier to resolve. At least some of the issues would be avoided. I don't know what training will tell a person that when the system says ""Complete the end date field"" they need to complete the end date field...

The end result was all the permission errors were fixed, they realized that training is important, and I now have 7 months of development and training sitting and waiting for a month or longer until the owner says the team has the capacity for 30 minutes of training. What he doesn't know is that rolling back the changes only caused more bugs, a misaligned org, and had minimal influence on the actual issue. 

The lesson I have learned: You can lead a horse to water, but if it's too dumb to drink it might kill itself. So, take baby steps and be ready for set backs. Don't kill the horse.

I work for myself as an IT consultant, generally *not* doing IT support. However, for a select few small businesses I serve as a one-person MSP so I still end up providing end-user support. By email only! And site-visits only happen after-hours—generally, so as not to ~~get hounded by impromptu requests~~ interrupt working employees, but also because I'm a stay-at-home parent so I tend to work evenings and weekends.

Like seriously. They could be sisters. If you know it, the better you can imagine her accent the more entertaining this story will be!

**$adm:** The mediator, Admin Manager, Quite Competent Organizational Type at $SmallAdAgency

# **Summer 2015**

$mr needs a new laptop; $SmallAdAgency, being leading-edge, avant-guard, creative types, have an almost exclusively Mac ecosystem. Thus far, the only laptops in the office are MacBook Airs; However, the new one-port USB-C MacBooks have just been released—*in colour* for the first time.

&gt; **$ua:** I think your requirements are pretty straight forward, I'll just get you a new MacBook Air like the others in the office?

&gt; **$mr:** I *must* have one in Rose Gold.

&gt; **$ua:** ... And you still want an external monitor?

&gt; **$mr:** Yes.

&gt; **$ua:** And your fullsize keyboard and mouse?

&gt; **$mr:** Well, of course!

&gt; **$ua:** OK, well thing thing about the new MacBooks is that they only have one port and it is actually a new standard, USB-C, so there isn't much that supports it yet. That means that everything you want to connect to it is going to need an adapter. Connecting more than one thing at a time is going to require extra-special adapters—there are no USB-C hubs or docks yet.

&gt; **$mr with a condescending look:** Wireless *is* the way of the *future*. I *must* have a Rose Gold computer!

&gt; **$ua:** Yup.

# **About a Month Ago**

$mr has survived mostly without incident with a single multi-purpose dongle—I have not physically seen the laptop since I set it up, since she always takes it home. Snow is on the horizon, and she heard through the grapevine that I had set up super-special, by request-only, remote server access. I can give her access, but I need to set it up on the computer, which I can only access from the office network (without resorting to something like join.me—instructions of any sort are a challenge, so it's not my first choice).

&gt; **$mr:** I was chatting with $adm and they mentioned that you've devised a new way to gain remote access to our server! Can you send me the instructions? That would be super useful to me in light of tomorrow's snow storm!

... I can't connect to her computer, which *is* in the office. Several trouble-shooting e-mails later, she concludes with,

&gt; **$mr:** Speaking of which, when am I due for a new computer? I can't plug anything into this one and it is very frustrating! Maybe I should get the same kind as the rest of the office...

&gt; **$ua:** /)_-)

# **This Morning**

Having received the disappointing news that she's not scheduled for a new computer for another year or two, $mr resigns herself to the seventh level of dongle hell. Truth be told, I have a bit of a soft spot for her and, being the benevolent sort, I recommend to management that we get her a dock, since they are now actually available. I bring it in and set it up after hours as is my habit—of course, her laptop is with her so I can't test it out. And it's the only laptop in the office with USB-C, so I can't borrow on to test it. *But* it came with both a USB-C and a regular USB connector, so I borrow someone else's laptop, connect the USB, confirm it's working, swap the connectors, carefully lay the USB-C cable back down where her dongle usually lays and send her a ""surprise!"" e-mail.

&gt; **$ua:** I set up a dock for you! I will give you more flexibility with regards to ports. I wasn't able to test it, but you should just be able to plug it in and everything should work! Let me know if you have any problems. I left your old dongle there in case there any problems.

&gt; **$mr:** Unfortunately, it doesn't work. It's the wrong size! Perhaps, I should personally buy this computer and we should look into purchasing one for me that is like the others in the office!

&gt; **$ua:** What do you mean it's the wrong size? It's specifically designed for your computer.

&gt; **$mr:** I mean that the docking station does not have the appropriately sized hole to plug my computer into! It's not a standardized size!

&gt; **$ua, now copying $adm:** ... The dock came with a different connector cable that I *did* use to test it. I am sure that I swapped them out before I left, but I guess it is conceivable that I did not. If that's the case, the correct cable is just $preciseLocation.

&gt; **$mr:** Outlook won't connect at all and I can't download my e-mails!

&gt; **$adm:** I can't get her Outlook to connect at all. I don't have today to fiddle with her cables—she's pulled them all and gone back to her dongle so I don't even know what you had going on.

&gt; **$ua:** /)_-)  Can you leave your laptop in the office tonight, please?

&gt; **$mr:** Currently, it's not in the realm of possibility for me to leave my laptop in the office. The amount of work that needs to be done prior to April 1st isn't easily achieved in a standard work day! Isn't it possible for you to come by during business hours?

&gt; **$ua:** Not on short-notice.

# **This Afternoon**

I remote desktop to her machine and fix her Outlook. Why, oh why does Outlook exist? And why, oh why is it the one piece software that the technically illiterate cling to like it's a shattered bulwark in North-Atlantic shipwreck?

&gt; **$ua:** The username in your account settings was set to only half of your e-mail address instead of the whole thing.

&gt; **$mr:** How on god's green earth did that happen? I have not touched *anything* no my Outlook or it's settings! So bizarre!

# **This Evening**

I come in to look at the dock without the laptop. I figure I *must* have mistakenly left the USB connector on it instead of the USB-C. I have a toddler—this would not be the stupidest thing I have done in the last two years. I just remember swapping them! Of course, my memory has also been a little tricksy in the last couple of years so...

I *had* swap them! USB-C connector sitting right there just aching to be connected to be connected and looking remarkably identical to the dongle. She managed pulled the HDMI and USB keyboard from the dock and put them back into dongle and then put the dongle back into the computer herself, but couldn't connect the dock to her computer? I put everything back into the dock, tape the dock USB-C and the dongle USB-C onto the desk with a post-it underneath reading ""put this → where → this used to go.""

&gt; **$ua:** The correct connector *was* on the dock. I've reconnected everything and put a note on your desk that should make it very clear what goes where when you come in in the morning.

&gt; **$mr:** Thanks /u/UrbanAbydos. I did connect the new docking station but couldn't get my computer to recognize the monitor.

Newbosterone,Dear App Developer: Please Die in A Fire. Slowly.,"tl;dr:  App Developer decides to reinvent the wheel, badly, killing server in the process.

Here's why the Newb missed lunch today:

We spend lots of money on an enterprise monitoring product. Call it $OpenSpew, since unless you spend lots more time and money it spews alerts on things you don't care about.  It's integrated into our trouble ticketing system.

An incident manager IMs me.  They are essentially help desk operators who triage.  She's got a High Priority Incident:  ""Node XYZ is not Responding.  It is Probably Down"".  It's high priority because XYZ runs the call center software and database for one of our divisions in one of our favorite countries.  It's their night, but they're be back online in a few hours, expecting to ~~enter their own personal hell~~ take incoming calls.

(*An aside:  I understand why they call it the Hell Desk.  Either you're on the front lines, and speak to users, or you become an incident manager, and stomp on fires all day.  Thanks guys, you're worth your weight in gold*).

I grab the ticket, and start my checklist.  Hmm, ping works, no packet loss.  SSH works, but takes a little longer after connection to log in.  Hit uptime:

    [root@XYZ /]# uptime
    18:04:52 up 50 days, 17:37,  1 user,  load average: 752.64, 744.72, 723.48

Yeah, that might do it.  Reach into my bag of tricks: ""Processes per User"".

    [root@XYZ /]# ps -ef | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort -bdf | uniq -c
      1 dbus
     10 hpsmh
      1 ntp
     16 postgres
    1313 root
      1 smmsp
    1604 Crappy_App

A quick check:  the root processes are CROND.  The Crappy_App processes are ""Monitor1.sh"" and ""Monitor2.sh"".  So, Crappy_App runs a cron process, and it hangs.  Checking crontab, I see App Developer is running Monitor1 and Monitor2 **EVERY FREAKING MINUTE**.  Reading Monitor1.sh and Monitor2.sh, I notice two things:  they collect essentially the same information with minor formatting differences; and, there is a typo in the scripts so the only output is an error message.

Think about it:  2880 times a day, this script runs, and outputs an error message.  The error message gets mailed to App Dev's local account.  Because of the error, it also gets mailed to root's local account.  

It gets better:  The script has been broken for over a year.  For at least the last 400 days, the email has gone out.  Both root and App Dev's mailbox is over 300 MB, something like 1.2 million messages.  So App Dev **never logs into this box**.  Even if it generated useful data, App Dev **would never see it**.

It gets still better:  The script copies the data to a NAS archive directory.  Something has glitched in the last 12 hours, so accessing the directory hangs.  That explains a few hundred of the 1604 Crappy_App processes that will not die.  From the system logs the glitch resolved itself in about an hour, so it was probably network or NAS maintenance.

And:  After the 40^th or 50^th hung process, sendmail decided the system was too busy, and stopped accepting new emails.   The cron job hangs trying to mail that (&amp;*#$# error message.  That's why there are  1000+ CROND and 1000+ Crappy_App processes that will not die.

The Kicker:  All of the information the developer is trying to collect is already being collected.  $OpenSpew Performance Mangler is collecting the system performance data, and $OpenSpew is watching the same things the script is monitoring.

In essence, App Developer runs two scripts a minute to get data that's already being collected, is being ignored, and uses a process that breaks the system if an error occurs.

It's pitchforks and torches time, my friends.

*By the way, it was only luck that we found this before the system died completely.  When the load average got high enough, the server couldn't respond to the ""Are You There?"" query $OpenSpew sent to the local $OpenSpew agent.*

mkgl,Squid Charger,"It was a normal day at our MSP helpdesk. We'd all just enjoyed lunch and had heads down working hard. Some were on phones, others were in the workshop, and as ever one or two were on reddit. 

Just a normal sunny day in IT helpdesk land. Little did we know what horrors lay ahead. 

It was a domino effect. 

My colleagues on the back row of desks fell first. One by one they jumped to their feet with uncharacteristic athleticism exclaiming disgust, clutching their noses, retching and fleeing. 

The confusion became palpable as the next row were overcome with the same shocking symptoms. 

It didn't matter that they were in the middle of calls, a support case, or a particularity absorbing article on the rarest of Pepes - they ran, screaming, in fear, panicked from their workstations. 

It was as though they were possessed. 

And then it hit me. 

A wall of stank like nothing I'd ever experienced awoke a primal desire within me to flee. As I sprinted for the door, weeping, the harrowing odor both confused and intrigued. Something this foul shouldn't exist. It was verging on biological warfare. *Hadn't the UN banned the use of chemical weapons?* I thought. This smell was a war crime. 

And it was too thick. This assault was too claggy and too relentless to be man-made. No flatulence, no matter how sloppy or vindaloo-fueled, could illicit such a violent reaction deep inside my lizard brain.

Driven by pure instinct we ran for the door. But some stopped before reaching safety - a morbid curiosity overcoming the brave few. 

The soup of stank was so thick that a distinct boundary lay between its fog of miasma and fresh, life-giving air. It was as if it resided within a bubble. Normal odors would gradually waft into existence, briefly increasing with intensity until dispersing through the surrounding atmosphere. But this was different. This terrible fragrance was sudden and extreme. It announced its existence with a punch straight to the sinuses. With one breath fresh, clean air, with the next a lung-choking quagmire of malaise. 

We were IT people. We were problem solvers. We had to investigate the source, lest we burn the office to the ground to kill it.

We turned and faced the monster. 

---

But before we conclude this tale, an interlude for background. 

Our Technical Director was, to put it bluntly (pun intended for later), an idiot savant. He was an incredible coder and DB admin, but he was terrible at anything else. His heavy dependence on ""jazz cabbage"" probably had something to do with it, but he was a walking comedy of errors. 

Many of these errors befell his car. He was the man that crashed into the ""do not park on the grass"" sign while parking on the grass. He was the man stood in the street with a piece of bumper in his hands after unsuccessfully attempting to stop his car from rolling away after exiting with the handbrake off. He was the man that crashed the company van into a petrol pump on its first day out. 

So, unsurprisingly, this man and his car were to blame for the malodorous, pestilent mist advancing through our office. 

---

A few brave souls held clothing to noses and ventured into the fog to identify the source. Almost beyond belief, this strength of stank grew worse as they approached the workshop. 

Through streaming eyes, the murderer-of-lungs was located. An innocent-looking customer laptop charger was somehow exuding the nasal rapist. 

As it heated, a swampy surface infusion of something hellish activated and became air-born. The charger was unplugged, bagged and rushed to the furthest bin on the industrial estate. Windows were opened and fans activated. 

Once the office became mildly habitable, we reluctantly re-entered. 

Checking the ticket attached to the cursed laptop charger, the guillotine of blame soon hung over our Technical Director's neck. 

After scrabbling around in his gange-addled short-term-memory, he managed to piece together a possible explanation to the mystery of the weaponized charger. 

A few weeks (yes weeks) back he purchased some squid from a local fish monger. Said squid was stored in the boot of his car and promptly forgotten. Only when he opened his boot to place in the picked-up customer laptop and charger did the stench hit him. He kindly elected to dispose of the squid at a mid-point between the customer location and our office. During extraction he surmised that, although squid never came into contact with the laptop, some ""run off"" from the decomposing mess may have dribbled onto the charger when the sack of mush was withdrawn from the depths of his car. 

Said run off adhered to and infected the charger transformer casing. When plugged in by an innocent engineer, the transformer gently heated the fermented and aged squid slime, cooking it to generously infuse the office atmosphere with Cthulhu's very own hell-fart.

TheITCustodian,"""Wanted: Clairvoyant IT Professional for challenging assignment. Must have own time machine.""","TL;DR: HR Manager's request requires prior planning, of which there is none.


I'm at my desk some idle Thursday afternoon here at $DangNerdGriefCompany, catching up on Reddit and contemplating my weekend plans (drinking and debauchery, which means Diet Coke and some Tarentino movies).  My email chimes and a help desk request ticket pops up from $HRManager.

""Setup $NewSalesPerson account. Will need laptop configured for California office. $NewSalesPerson start date is Monday, [CurrentDay+4]""

Whaa?  We have a small (very small) office in California that has a couple sales guys in it. I didn't know we were even contemplating *hiring* for a $NewSalesPerson, so consequently we don't have anything pre-positioned in California for a salesperson, never mind not even having hardware sitting on the shelf that is suitable to send to Cali on a one working day notice kind of situation.

I pick up the phone and call $HRManager.

&gt;$Me: ""Got your help desk ticket for $NewSalesPerson in California. The answer is 'no'.""

&gt;$HRManager: ""What? Why not?""

&gt;$Me: ""Because I don't have any computers currently laying around that are suitable to to send to a new remote employee. Especially not a sales person.""

&gt;$HRManager: ""But you can get him a *new* computer, right?""

&gt;$Me: ""Sure, as long as we have the budget for it.""

&gt;$HRManager: ""I'm pretty sure they have money in the budget for that. And it will be there on Monday all set for him to use?""

&gt;$Me: ""Who do I look like? Chuck Norris? No. He'll be lucky to have it by the *following* Monday, [CurrenyDay+11] if all the stars line up.""

&gt;$HRManager: ""So he's just supposed to sit around and do nothing for a week?""

&gt;$Me: ""Well, bascially, yeah. How long have we known this guy was going to start on Monday?""

&gt;$HRManager: ""He just accepted the position about 20 minutes ago.""

&gt;$Me: ""Let me rephrase: How long have you known that we've been going through the hiring process for $NewSalesPerson in the California office, and why are you giving me less that *two business days* notice that we have a new employee starting and you need new hardware?""

&gt;$HRManager: ""He just accepted the position and he can start early.""

&gt;$Me: ""I guess I'm not making the practical realities of the physics of IT and business clear. You've been seeking to hire $NewSalesPerson for the California office for some period of time, certainly longer than just this morning, right?""

&gt;$HRManager: ""Well, yeah.""

&gt;$Me: ""And whomever took the position was going to need a computer, email account, that sort of thing, right?""

&gt;$HRManager: ""Uh huh.""

&gt;$Me: ""So, no matter who *actually* took the position, we were going to need to get this person a computer, at a minimum.""

&gt;$HRManager: ""But he just accepted the position...""

&gt;$Me: ""You were going to continue looking for this position until you hired it, right?""

&gt;$HRManager: ""Sure.""

&gt;$Me: ""We were eventually going to need a computer, new or otherwise, for *some* $NewSalesPerson in California. If not this guy on this coming Monday, it would be someone else on the following Monday, or the Monday after that, or some Monday in the next 30 days or so, right?""

&gt;$HRManager: ""I guess.""

&gt;$Me: ""So what is so difficult to have the *common courtesy* of giving the IT Department a heads up that $DangNerdGriefCompany is actively looking to fill a position that is going to require us to purchase and configure hardware, or at the very least to ship hardware to California? You *know* we don't have new or even new-used hardware laying around the office. It takes a day to get a PO approved, and a day to order the hardware, then a few days, mostly because $DangNerdGriefCompany is too cheap to pay for overnight shipping, to receive that hardware. I can turn most new systems around in a about a day, but then its still another number of days to ship the equipment to California. I can't change that timeline by very much.  But if $HR, and in this case $NoSalesVP, would actually have a conversation with $Me about an open position's expected tech needs BEFORE we started hiring for the position, we wouldn't have to have this conversation nearly **EVERY TIME** you submit a request to setup up a new hire.""

DigitalPlumberNZ,"Sir, I wrote the book, you are definitely wrong","A bit of a different tale for TFTS, but I think it qualifies as support of a specialist nature. Also, much vicarious satisfaction.

I'm involved with a local community organisation, and we held the annual general meeting last night. I'm the resident constitutional expert for them, having conducted the last full revision of the constitution in 2013. At the request of the president I drafted changes for introduction last night to shrink the committee size a bit, and went along to the meeting in case there were any questions.

At the meeting one of the more, err, detail-oriented members of the organisation attempted to stop the change from taking effect immediately, by arguing about the intent of a particular existing clause relating to benefits of membership and how reducing the committee size somehow disenfranchised him and so could not take effect until next year (handy hint: read the whole document before trying to argue about specific clauses).  
I'm certain everyone in TFTS has wanted to tell a user exactly why they do not *actually* know what they think they know, so let me assure you it is truly glorious to be able to say words to the effect of, ""As the person who wrote this clause, these words, I know they do not mean what you think they mean.""

P13romancer,Are you sure you want us to call you?,"One of our original customers that has about 8k locations that we cover recently upgraded their service with us and gave us a list of some odd 1k locations all marked with the words ""Critical"" these were high priority 24/7 locations and high money makers for the customer.

Now, the acting head of tech support on their team (lets call him HTS) stated anytime one of these go down or have problems, we need to call him so that their company is aware and he can handle their side of the situation.

HTS, unaware of how many of these ""Criticals"" we see a day. Tried to warn him of this decision. There was much, much pleading from our end

TheITCustodian,"""No, no, its not me. Its you.""","One idle and fairly quiet Friday in late February at $BigBossCompany, I get back to my desk after lunch, ready to start surfing Reddit and trying to make it to the end of the day without strangling a co-worker or screaming senseless profanities at a customer (yes, my life as an $MSPManager had devolved to the simple things in life: violence and degradation). 

I open Outlook to take a look at an odd email that came in during lunch from $CluelessNonProfit’s control freak of an $ExecutiveDirector. I had glanced at it on my phone, saw that it was from $ExecutiveDirector and that it didn’t look like an urgent “system down!” issue so it could wait until I enjoyed my Subway.

&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: ""TheITCustodian, see the attached email from $Vendor of a new piece of equipment we're buying for our fleet of vehicles. They'll be here next Monday to install it.""

I scan the email, reading down to the $Vendor’s specs. The more I read, the more confused I get. I bring up $Vendor’s website. This is pretty extensive. Its not “a” piece of equipment, its more like several dozen pieces of hardware, wireless equipment and such. And $SystemSoftware. That runs on a separate server and potentially stores hundreds of gigabytes of data.

On a whim, I call the $Vendor, 4 timezones away, and ask for the $TechSpecialist who sent the email. After a short chat with him, tech guy to tech guy, all spec, facts and operational concepts understood, I call $CluelessNonProfit.ExecutiveDirector and play a little dumb.

&gt;$Me: ""Hi, $ED. I got your email about the equipment you’re having installed. Is this a $System for your entire fleet of vehicles?”

&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: “Yes, every piece of equipment will have this $System installed on it. I want you to install the $SystemSoftware on my PC.” (here’s where the control freak starts to peek out a little)

&gt;$Me: ""Uh, yeah, the $SystemSoftware won’t run on your PC. From the specs and the information supplied by $Vendor, $SystemSoftware is designed to run on a server class machine.”

&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: ""I didn’t know that. I want it to run on our current server, then.""

&gt;$Me: ""Your current server won't run this software, either. 2TB of space minimum required. Your whole server doesn’t even have 2TB on it. You'd be out of disk space before you know it. $System is designed around a dedicated server to manage the recorded data and the equipment. $SystemSoftware really has to be installed on a dedicated server, not your domain controller.""

&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: ""But, the $Vendor is going to be here next Monday to install this system. They’re flying a tech in from [four timezones away].""

&gt;$Me: ""Wait, Monday as in three days from now? Not a week from Monday? How long has this been in the works?""

&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: ""Since the middle of January.""

Unbeknownst to $ExecutiveDirector, $TechSpecialist at $Vendor mentioned to me on the phone that they’d been out to do a site survey back around Thanksgiving as part of their quote, and $Vendor got the green light to proceed well before Christmas. They’d even sent techs from their $LocalPartner to install the hardware on all the vehicles in the previous month. $ExecutiveDirector was totally lying to me on that. 

But I knew that the installer, who was flying on Monday, wasn’t going to start his actual work until Tuesday and even then, he had a bunch of prep work to do, wiring and mounting the exterior wireless access points that communicate with the vehicles, etc, before he would even be to the point where the server was needed. We had a *tiny* bit more breathing room than $ExecutiveDirector was letting on. I wasn’t going to burn the $Vendor, but I wasn’t letting $ExecutiveDirector off the hook, either.

&gt;$Me: ""So you *just now* thought to involve the IT people on the Friday before a major implementation, one that requires a server and possibly network changes, that you knew was coming for *months*?""

I sensed slight change in $ExecutiveDirector’s tone.  Almost a pleading.

&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: ""Look, the board is all over me on this project, we have to get it working on time. How soon can you have a server? $Vendor’s tech is flying in on Monday to start the install, I can’t have him standing around…""

&gt;$Me: ""We’re IT guys, not miracle workers. You didn’t even HINT at this whole thing until about an hour ago. I don’t have servers sitting on the shelf, ready to bail out customers who don’t involve their IT people in major IT projects until 72 hrs beforehand, you know. It could take up to a week. And then, I already have techs scheduled to work on projects next week with customers who *actually* plan ahead and communicate with their IT consultants, so I’d have to figure out who I can bust loose to work on *your emergency*, never mind a legit emergency that might occur at another customer site.  It might not even be until Thursday or Friday I could get someone over there, depending on whether or not I can even get a server in time…”

&gt;$ExecutiveDirector: “A week! Oh my god…”

&gt;$Me: “I tell you what, I've gotta bust my ass to get you a Statement of Work and a quote for the server and our installation work. I'll get something over to you in the next couple hours for your approval. But I’m going to tell you up front: its not going to be a custom box, it will be the first available off-the-shelf server that meets the minimum $SystemSoftware spec that I can get fast-tracked for delivery at some point next week. That’s even *if* I can get one. And the shipping is not going to be cheap. And all of this is of course a project, meaning its time &amp; materials and not covered under your break-fix contract.”

While we'd been on the phone, I had 2-3 potential severs picked out in my supplier’s inventory system and I was building a quote in our work order system. 5 minutes after I’d hung up from $ExecutiveDirector, I was in $BigBoss’s office to get the quote approved. I explained the whole thing to him. 

Often, $BigBoss was an asshole about stuff like this, so I never knew if I was going to get a ream job along with my request to approve a quote. $BigBoss must have been in a good mood, but even his brow furrowed when I explained $ExecutiveDirector’s lack of planning and how we were going to have to bail them out. $BigBoss liked it when we could bail a customer out, because that made us look more valuable when it came time to pay the bill.

&gt;$BigBoss: “Fsck her, tack another $500 on this under miscellaneous, call it “Expedite Fee” or something, just for her lack of planning, and send it. I’ll give you half of that for putting up with her shit and very obviously going the extra mile to fix their fsck up, and we’ll give the other half to whichever tech you send to install, just as incentive to deal with their crap.”

&gt;$Me: “OK, chief. Basically, do what we need to do to make it work, but make sure its somewhat painful so they think twice the next time?""

&gt;$BigBoss: ""Exactly.”

$ExecutiveDirector approved the Statement of Work &amp; server quote, with the shipping and the expedite fee. I ordered the box and had it setup for a Monday delivery (gotta love good relations with your suppliers and Next Day Air) at our office so we could do a quick config on it before bringing it to $CluelessNonProfit’s offices. After an hour and a half of crazy, things were looking up.

I called $Vendor again and spoke to the $InstallTech who was flying out, just to make sure neither of us was going to get blindsided by some requirement that $CluelessNonProfit would have neglected to mention. I wanted to be sure we were clear on what $Vendor and $InstallTech expected and wanted from a network standpoint to get their data onto the $CustomerLAN and back to the server. Last thing I wanted was to have to pull an audible to setup a last minute VLAN on Wednesday afternoon, or have him hear “Oh, hahaha, we didn’t think it would matter that our walls are three feet thick. What do you mean you can’t drill thru 3 ft of masonry and concrete?” 

Strangely enough, the whole thing the next week went essentially like clockwork: The wireless access points were installed and connected with no drama and no interference with the $CluelessNonProfit’s wifi, even. Server showed up on time, was configured at our office, installed on site Tuesday, joined to their domain, setup for backup and handed off to the $InstallTech on Wednesday. We installed the client software on the machines that needed it (the control-freak $ExecutiveDirector, notably) and helped facilitate a little user training (more billable time, baby) and $System testing. 

At the end of the day on Thursday, during full-up $System testing, a fly appeared in the proverbial ointment.

This $System is installed on $CluelessNonProfit’s vehicles. They spent big money on equipping every single piece of equipment that they have with these recording boxes along with a vehicle-mounted wireless antenna that talks to the server. Basically, a vehicle comes *within range* of the wireless access points outside the building, and it connects and downloads the vehicle's data to the server. Pretty straightforward and easy. Since it is regular 802.11 wireless, the vehicles have to essentially be in the parking lot to communicate with this $System. That has been a pretty constant piece of information in *all* of the literature I read from $Vendor, and in how they describe the function of the $System. 

In the midst of some emails flying back and forth, it is uncovered that some of $CluelessNonProfit’s $System-equipped vehicles don't *ever* come to the facility on a daily basis. But yet, $ExecutiveDirector has some nebulous expectation that these vehicles will somehow *magically* communicate with the $System and download their data, even dozens of miles from their building. 

Mind you these people have been working with this $Vendor since before December, identified all the vehicles that this hardware would be installed on, they had the $LocalPartner installers come out and install the $System equipment and wireless antennas in the vehicles. 

And never once did $CluelessNonProfit even mentioned to the $Vendor that four of their vehicles are in a completely separated operating location 30 miles away from the main building, three or four of them at any one time are at a maintenance garage elsewhere, and at least five of their vehicles go home with the drivers at night. In other words, at least twelve or thirteen pieces of their equipment don't come to the main building. Ever. Unless they need to be dispatched to maintenance and sometimes not even then.

Suddenly they are all unhappy with $Vendor that their pieces of equipment that are far afield will not communicate with the $System at the main office. And of course, it's not the $Vendor's issue. It is *very clear* in the product literature that the vehicle has to be within range of the outdoor wifi at the office to download the data from the vehicle. And, $CluelessNonProfit let the vendor install the hardware in every piece of vehicle they have, knowing they have vehicles that never ever come to the main building, and they never said a word until now. The day before the guy gets on the plane to fly home.

As a result, we're overworked, underpaid, hated by management(a common theme among IT workers), and literally kept in a dungeon with our servers and network equipment(ok, it's a basement, forgive the hyperbole). And we frequently take calls from patients with various medical conditions that are far too eager to share the most intimate details we'd rather not know. 

Every now and then we get the patient that may very well be suffering from dementia(calling so much that we're on a first name basis with the patient and we can recognize them by their voice). Successfully talking an 85 year old who's never used a computer through using their very first iPad to log on to this website is an act worthy of recognition-falling just short of the word ""miracle""- and we do it multiple times daily. 

We also take calls from people who evidently feel that the misery their medical conditions create for them entitles them to be hostile towards others(like those people forced to try and help them) and will try to make them miserable too. As the saying goes; misery loves company.

Management is well aware that the calls can get particularly rough, there are enough profanity-laced tirades tossed around between calls to make even the most experienced sailor blush. It can be extremely stressful so we're given a lot of leeway as long as we remain somewhat professional with the callers. That can be trying at times. This is one of those tales.

$olfh: ""I can't access my *companies product*

$me: ""I can help with that

At this point I gather her information and have her confirm her information for HIPAA compliance purposes. 

$me: ""It appears you were locked out of your account due to unsuccessful password entry attempts, I have reactivated your account- would you like me to reset your password to a temporary one so you can change it or do you know it""

$olfh: ""I'm not an idiot, I know how computers work, I know my password""

$me: ""I didn't think you were an idiot ma'am, can you just go ahead and log in, I just want to verify you're able to get in to your account before we disconnect this call""

$olfh: ""It says Login Unsuccessful""

You all know what this means, she doesn't know her password.

$me: ""Ok ma'am, I've just reset your password to (a very easy password that Spaceballs would approve of), when you sign in with that as the password you'll immediately be prompted to select a new password. That password just needs to be (outlines password requirements which are VERY lenient). 

$olfh: I don't want to change my password

$me: ""Does your existing password meet the security requirements I've just explained to you? If it does you can just re-enter it and use it.""

$olfh: ""No""

$me: ""I'm sorry ma'am, you'll need to choose a new password then that meets those requirements""

$olfh: ""But I don't want to change my password, you should have told me I'd have to change my password"" 

$me: ""Ma'am, users whose passwords do not meet the new password security requirements would have been required to change their password on their next login"" these changes were implemented about a month and a half ago. 

$olfh: ""Well, I don't want to change my password""

I can see where this is going, and no...she's not getting what she wants.

$me: ""Ma'am, if you don't choose a password that meets the new security requirements you won't be able to access your *company service we provide to patients for free*.""

$olfh: ""Let me speak with your supervisor""

$me: ""No Ma'am, my supervisor would have to tell you the same thing I am explaining to you. You are not required to use the *company service we provide for free* but if you do choose to use it, you must do so under the terms that we outlined, among those terms is that you use a password that we deem as secure, which your password currently is not. If you do not wish to use a secure password, you can not use the *company service*""

$olfh: ""I'm the customer, I'm always right you little %^&amp;%"" 

And at that, my inner BOFH awakened. Yes...she just swore at me.

And with that I deactivated her account, marked her as forbidden from accessing the service(and the reason why), and disconnected the call.

That was the highlight of my day.

&gt; 
&gt; $Printing_Company_Lady: ""I can't print.""
&gt;
&gt; $Me: ""Ok, let me take a look.""

This was a priority as it was one of their large run printers hung off a dedicated machine running custom printing software. It took special paper, special ink and had binding and sorting devices bolted onto the side. 

In case of issues we were always the first port of call. The machine often just needed a service restart, or the job que clearing out. 

The users had a standard pre-printing procedure to run through before activating a job, because they were so massive - a job of could take all night to complete. 

I churn through the usual troubleshooting steps remotely, but can't identify the exact issue. It was definitely having problems; the status page was throwing up some strange errors and the custom software log was vomiting out hundreds of weird entries. From what I could decipher it was some sort of hardware error. Not good. 

As they were just down the road, I called $Printing_Company_Lady and let her know I would pop onsite to take a look. I was expecting a long afternoon on the phone to the manufacturer with printer ink ruining my sweet nylon shirt.  

I arrive and head to her desk. She had that *its your fault my things aren't working* look on her face. 

I ask the obvious question:

&gt; $Me: ""Are you sure you followed the pre-printing procedure?""
&gt; 
&gt; $Printing_Company_Lady: ""I don't have time for all that. I need to get this job out ASAP.""
&gt;
&gt; $Me: Sigh. ""Ok, I'll head down to the printing room and check it out.""

Their offices were on the floor above the printing room to separate staff from the noise of the huge printers. I go down and open the door. Immediately I see the problem. 

A pair of human legs are hanging out of an access panel in the side of the printer. 

&gt; $Me: ""Hi. Are you fixing the printer?""
&gt; 
&gt; $Printer_Tech: ""Yeah. Scheduled maintenance. Shouldn't be much more than another hour.""
&gt;
&gt; $Me: ""Ok. Do you know who authorized your visit?""

dustindps,"""I deleted the internet, please help"" - Little old woman","So I used to work at an electronic retail store. We were one of the biggest stores in my state, and I worked in the computers department. It was an early Sunday morning, which was typically our slowest time, so I took more time with customers.

This particular day a little old woman walks quickly into my department, looking scared, tears in her eyes. She walks up to me holding her laptop and asks me why everyone is looking so calm. I ask her, why wouldn't they be calm? She looks me in the eye, scrunches her face, sobs, and says ""Because I deleted the internet, please help"".

**What I wanted to do:**

I ask her ""The whole internet? You deleted the internet?"" *goes on walkie* ""We have a code red in the computer department, we got her"".

**What actually happened:**

She cries and explains to me that she was scared that the ""internet police"" were going to arrest her because she deleted the internet explorer icon from her desktop. She was under the impression that because she deleted her icon, she deleted ALL OF THE WORLDS INTERNET OMFG.

Instead of normally sending her to the tech counter like normally with other customers who come to me with tech help, I sat her down and explained to her that she just deleted her access to the internet, and went to her Recycle Bin on her desktop and restored her icon. She realized how silly she was after I told her this and gave me a hug before leaving my store.

My inner demons wanted to mess with her, but I couldn't pull myself to do that.

Gambatte,"Encyclopædia Moronica: C is for Coincidence, or Lack Thereof","*They have a saying in Chicago, Mr Bond: Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time, it's enemy action.*  
- Auric Goldfinger; *Goldfinger*, Ian Fleming

---

It was a long and glorious week of leave; the weather mostly cooperated and I thought of work only fleetingly - I had been assured that I could rest easily, knowing that another technician was covering my area.

So it was with little trepidation that I returned to work yesterday morning. I discovered that the covering technician had left some notes on the work he'd completed; not much, but about as much as I had expected.  
What I had not expected, however, was two UPS units sitting on the floor of the workshop, with a note on them. No fault details, not even a job number - only that they had been removed from the same site. The units were identical; chances are that they were purchased in a single order, installed at the same time, and had been running a nigh-identical load for a nigh-identical period. It's not impossible for them both to fail in less than a week, and for it to be nothing more than coincidence.

At least, that's what I told myself.  
I'm not sure that I believed me, even then.

As I sunk my teeth into the workload and returned to my regular routine, I let the coincidence rest in the back of my mind. If there was anything there worthy of further investigation, it would come to me eventually - after all, I had the physical units with me; once I had some spare time, I could dredge the event logs for anything illuminating.  
Spare time, however, was not forthcoming - while my first job had appeared to be a routine touchscreen replacement, actually attempting to install the new screen led me to discover that the old combined USB+power lead was not compatible with the new screen, as the new screen used a different power connector. Fortunately, I had a USB+power cable to suit the new screen, but now I had to remove and replace the old cable - and this led me to the second discovery; the old cable had been run through an extremely tortuous path.  
A considerable amount of time and effort later, I had the new screen in place, working correctly, and the customer was happy. However, the customer also had some ""Well, while you're here"" issues - while some of them should have been resolved by the screen replacement, at least one issue required some further research.  
I was entering the requirement for further investigation into my job notes system when my phone rang. I recognised the number: it was from the Job Dispatch team.

&gt; Job Dispatcher (JD): Hey G, what's up?

&gt; ME: Not much, just finishing up this touchscreen replacement; it turned in to a bit of a nightmare. I should have expected it, on the first job back from leave.

&gt; JD: Ha! Yeah, that always happens.

&gt; ME: What's happening?

&gt; JD: We've just had a job come in - a UPS is playing up.

&gt; ME: That sucks - I've got no spares at the moment.

&gt; JD: Yeah, *{cover tech}* mentioned that last week.

&gt; ME: Alright, I'll just finish up the notes on this job and get on the road to... Where's the faulty UPS again?

&gt; JD: It's at *{site}*.

&gt; ME: Wait a second... That's the site that *{cover tech}* took those two UPS units out of last week!

&gt; JD: Is it...? Yeah, actually, I think you're right.

&gt; ME: Okay, I'm on my way. Something is going on out there, because you don't lose three UPS units in less than a fortnight.

&gt; JD: Cool, just let me know.

---

About half an hour later, I arrived at the site. Chances are that - if the UPS actually had developed a fault - all I could do is bypass the UPS.

&gt; Site Manager (SM): Hey! So we bypassed the UPS...

Be still my beating heart.

&gt; SM: ...and the computer is up and running okay, so it must be a UPS issue.

&gt; ME: Okay. What was the UPS doing?

&gt; SM: Oh, it was beeping all the time, just like those two last week. That means it's dead, right?

&gt; ME: More often than not, but let me check it out, and I'll see if I can figure out what's going on.

I plugged the UPS back in, and turned it on. I pulled up the internal Event Log; lots of ""Input voltage below alarm level"" entries for July 16, 2011, but nothing recent. On a hunch, I backed up to the Settings menu, and checked the internal date/time settings.  
The current date was set to July 16, 2011.

I pulled up the Measurements menu, and checked the Input level: 215VAC. The nominal voltage is 240VAC, so the power is about 10% below the normal level.  
I checked the alarm level: it was set at 15%.

&gt; ME: Hey, SM?

&gt; SM: Yes?

&gt; ME: You've got a problem here with your electricity - it's coming out of the wall sockets about 10% lower than normal; it's only a couple of volts away from triggering your UPS alarms.

&gt; SM: What would that do?

&gt; ME: Well, for starters, it would make them beep all the time...

Oh snap. The two removed by the covering tech last week are most likely not faulty at all.

&gt; ME: ...which may mean that I can reinstall the two that were removed last week, as they have never actually been faulty.

&gt; SM: So what do I do?

&gt; ME: Unfortunately, this is outside what I am legally allowed to cover; you need a licensed electrician for this one.

&gt; SM: Okay, let me make some calls...

---

The following morning, I called the site back. The Site Manager told me that the electrician had been unable to find any fault inside the site, but eventually discovered that the external supply from the town mains was at a reduced level. The town's electrical contractors were engaged, and eventually reported that most of the town is affected by the issue.  
They just didn't know what was causing it yet - because it was only reported the day before, *when the electrician called them.*

I re-installed the two UPS units removed last week. At the very least, they're acting as surge suppressors and inverters, so the connected equipment is actually getting 240VAC.

**TL/DR:** Third time's a charm - to discover an issue affecting a whole town for over a week, that no one else had identified or reported.",talesfromtechsupport,1233,1521502206
Phrewfuf,Netnotworking: Here is your shovel,"Time for another story about my networker escapades. This time it is a tale of planning.

*****

**Backstory**

This was about two or three years ago, when i worked for our campus LAN team. We were responsible for Build and Run of campus networks, providing connectivity to all the people working in the company. Which also included setting up networks in new buildings. As most of our main locations were doing massive renovations in addition to a few newly created business units, people had to move somewhere. Said somewhere were rented office buildings. A lot of them. Too many, to be honest, i alone was juggling three simultaneously.

Each building was declared a project and had a project manager. It was the same guy for all buildings in my case, so i knew him all too well. You can imagine him as an internal consultant, that people need to contact when they want to rent some office space. He knew all the stuff that needed to be taken care of and who had to be informed. The problem was that he was basically an internal contractor, he had to be paid internally. You can probably see where this is going, but i'll tell you anyways: Someone cheaped out.

**People** 

$Cust: The customer. The Person responsible for getting the building ready for people to move in.

$PM: The project manager. See above.

$Lead: My leader.

$ISP: The ISP that got the deal.

$Phrewfuf: Mr. ""Didn't i have a bottle of Whiskey stashed somewhere?""

*****

It was a nice day in January of some year. Coming to work, $Phrewfuf already was wondering which of the two building responsibles would be the one crying the most. It was easier to prioritize one over the other if there was a significant difference in their tone, suggesting urgency. He was thinking about this on his way to work for he did not yet discover the doctrine of ~~not giving a damn~~ Zen.

Upon arrival our hero was amazed. There were no emails calling for immediate action. No one expecting him to throw a bunch of switches into the company car and go save the world. The world or someone elses failed planning, that is. It seemed like it would be a great day. Even the coffee mug on our protagonists table looked like it was smiling, waiting to be filled by the machine.

But just as he was grabbing his by now filled mug, $Phrewfuf noticed a shadow forming. Darkness started to surround him. $Lead was standing right behind him, covering the light with his body.

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Hi $Lead. What's going on?

&gt; $Lead: Hi. Remember $Cust from Location X? They're planning to rent a building somewhere, can you take care of that?

&gt; $Phrewfuf: *crap, not another one* Well...i am kind of busy right now, kind of difficult to squeeze in another big project like this. 

&gt; $Lead: Yeah, i know. But the others are already covering for the two sick guys...sooo.

&gt; $Phrewfuf: I see. Well, i'll do my best. But i might need some help, depending on the size of the building. Send me the info you have.

After receiving the emails from $Lead, $Phrewfuf went on to do a quick glance over them. He figured that a building was already chosen, the rental contract already signed and it even had a protocol from the last meeting some people had. Without involving the networkers. And there was no sign of $PMs name in there. This was bad.

A quick call to $PM confirmed that he did not know about any of this. Thus the only way to get some info was to call $Cust directly.

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Hi, this is $Phrewfuf speaking with central IT networking.

&gt; $Cust: Hello, this is $Cust. Are you calling because of our network?

&gt; $Phrewfuf: *Wow, this guy must be Sherlock himself* Uh, yes, i've been told you're planning on moving some people into a new building. This of course needs network service. Can you send me all the requirements regarding that? Also, why didn't you involve $PM? He's always the one contacting us with requirements and stuff like that? Especially when you're planning to move in.

&gt; $Cust: Sure, I'll send you everything. We didn't contact $PM because he is in a completely different location, plus we didn't get the budget to contract him.

A few emails and some coffee spewed over the table later, another call was made.

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Uh, hi, this is $Phrewfuf again. You're joking, right? *still trying to wipe the remnants of a perfectly fine coffee off the table*

&gt; $Cust: Huh? What do you mean?

&gt; $Phrewfuf: You not only already rented the building, but also started to move furniture in there? And you're expecting people to move in in three weeks? 

&gt; $Cust: Yes. What is the problem with that?

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Well...just to make sure that we both understand this correctly: You have not informed us in time so we could acquire the hardware required, you have no info on how long $ISP will need to get you that 10GBit line and you're planning on getting 250 people into the building in three weeks?

&gt; $Cust: Yes, that is correct. And i expect you to take care of all that, as you're responsible for the network. And i will escalate if this is not done in time.

This called for a quick chat between $Phrewfuf and $Lead. The result was that our hardworking hero was to do what he could and ignore the time constraints as they were not realistic in the first place.

A call to $ISP confirmed that they would need about three months to get the 10G fiber line to the building, provided that the weather does not drop below 0°C at any time, as frozen ground would make it impossible to instsall the fiber. $Phrewfuf informed $Lead about this, just in case, and dialed $Custs number again.

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Hi. So...we have a problem. And by we i mean you. $ISP says they need about three months to deliver the fiber to the building. And delivery of the required components will take about two months plus a week or two for firmware updates and configuration, including getting an IP-Range with DHCP/DNS set up. Which means you'll have to wait with move-in until all that is done.

&gt; $Cust: WHAT? THREE WEEKS? We want to move in in three!

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Months. Not weeks.

&gt; $Cust: WHAT?! How is this posible that getting an internet connection takes that long?! We're an enterprise customer and it takes longer to get internet than it takes for me at my apartment? This is unacceptable, i'm going to call your superior.

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Well...there's nothing i can do about it, it's what $ISP told me. I will inform $Lead about your call. Have a nice day.

*****

A day later, $Lead and $Phrewfuf were talking about this while grabbing a coffee. $Lead explained the conversation between him and $Cust in great detail. How he chewed $Cust for not involving $PM and how, upon being asked what can be done to accelerate the delivery of the network, he replied with 

&gt; Well, i can give you a shovel so you can start digging the trench for the fiber.

**TL;DR:** Failure to plan on your side does not constitute an emergency on my side.

ProblemExists,Obtaining all relevant information...,"Some time ago (this story is about 10+ years old) I worked for a large 16-18 college.  This place had a principal and a number of deputies, who ranged from okay through to awful.  This is a story about the most obnoxious of them.  It happened to another tech in my team, but I was around for it.



$ObDep - Obnoxious Deputy

$Tech - Technician colleague



The principal's wife had recently been issued with a Blackberry at work, so he and his deputies decided that they all needed them.  Our team specced up everything they'd need (including the Blackberry Enterprise Server etc.) and came back to them with a five-figure cost which was clearly ridiculous for the limited benefit they would provide.  They decided to go with it anyway, but to cheap out on handsets, bare minimum contracts, no roaming, etc.



So... they've been running this for about a year or so - most of the handsets checking in once a week at best (because they're hardly ever switching them on, never mind using them), when $ObDep phones in.  He's shouty from the off, and is the kind of guy who regularly threatens people's jobs over minor inconveniences despite not having the power to actually directly fire us. 



His Blackberry isn't picking up his emails.  We pass him to $Tech, as he's the only one with access. $Tech checks the BES, and his device hasn't checked in for a week.  He's one of the few who does use it, so this is unusual.  $Tech starts the usual list.  Is it making calls? (Yes)  Can he send an email? (No) Can we send him an email? (No) Restart device.  Pull battery for 10 minutes and try again. Check enrolment. Nothing's working.



$Tech finishes up the phone call with a promise that we're doing our best to get him back online ASAP.



Investigations commence.  All of the other devices check in at some point over the next three days, and all the while we're taking further calls from an increasingly irate $ObDep.  In some of these calls, he's literally screaming about how effing incompetent we are.  We ask him to bring it in.  He's ""too busy"". We ask him if we can come to him. It's ""not convenient"".



Some of you will have twigged already.



It's drifting towards close of play on day 3 when $ObDep calls to scream at us some more.  $Tech is at the end of his rope.

  

$Tech: ""I'm sorry, but there's literally nothing more I can do without access to the device.  We need the device on site to find out why it isn't checking in.""

$ObDep: ""THAT'S RIDICULOUS.  I CAN'T BRING IT IN. I'M IN EFFING SPAIN YOU MORON. DO YOU EXPECT ME TO FLY HOME EARLY FOR THIS?""

$Tech: ""No, of course not, but... hang on... you're in Spain?""

$ObDep: ""I'M NOT CUTTING MY HOLIDAY SHORT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO YOUR EFFING JOB PROPERLY.""

$Tech: ""But you opted not to have roaming on your contracts.""

$ObDep: ""WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING? THIS IS ABOUT EMAIL.""

$Tech: ""Email uses data.  Without roaming, you have no data when you're abroad.""

$ObDep: ""WELL SWITCH IT ON THEN IDIOT""

$Tech: ""I would if I could, but this is a contract issue, not a server issue.  It has to go through the mobile phone company.""

$ObDep: ""I EXPECT THIS WORKING WITHIN THE HOUR.""



The phone goes dead.  He wasn't on speakerphone, but the office isn't that big, and he had been VERY shouty.  $Tech speaks to the leadership team people about authorising the expenditure, phones the mobile phone company - and yes, they'll put that through for us right now.  It'll take 3-5 working days to take effect (because, ten years ago).  $Tech explains, asks what can be done to speed it up, and is told that's how long the system takes to update and activate the new contract.



$Tech calls back $ObDep.  $ObDep tells him we're all getting fired as soon as he gets back.  $Tech's boss phones $ObDep and tells him the same re: outcome. $ObDep tells him the same.



A week later, $ObDep gets back and we hear no more of it.



TL;DR: Back when roaming was expensive, senior person decides it's unnecessary, then goes abroad, then threatens to fire us all when he can't get his email. Nobody got fired.

Stabage,I broke the cable on the baby monitor!,"I have been browsing this subreddit for almost a year and I'm really happy to share this first story.

*I work for a small company and run the front of the store for sales and tech question. I also do work for local companies that have trouble with their equipment. It's a nice sunny Saturday and it's quite dead so far until a little old lady comes in.*

$me = me

$OL = old lady

&gt;$OL: Hi there, I'm looking for a plugin for a baby monitor. Do you carry those?

&gt;$me: I'm sorry, we don't sell baby monitors here.

*OL looks over the counter and sees some wall plugs and cigarette lighter adapters in a display*

&gt;$OL: Oh it looks just like those!

&gt;$Me: Oh, the plugin for it is like a usb?(The wall chargers have usb A on the end, nothing else).

&gt;$OL: Yeah, it's kind of like a phone's, but round.

Round? That sounds more like a regular DC plug for something.

&gt;$Me: Do you have the baby monitor with you?

&gt;$OL: I don't, it's back at the house. Oh I have a cable in the car that looks like the one from the baby monitor, should I bring it in?

&gt;$Me: Sure, that works.

She steps out for a minute to grab whatever plugin she might have. She brings in her plugin. It's not a usb connector, but a basic DC Plug for something. I give it a once over, it looks similar to some old connectors I have in the back of our shop. It also has a DC voltage of 9V.

&gt;$Me: Does this plugin have the same voltage as the baby monitor?

&gt;$OL: Yes, 120V.

I quickly explain the difference between AC and DC Voltage, but don't make any headway.

&gt;$Me: Is there anyway you can bring the plugin for the baby monitor to the shop? If I see it I can compare it to the ones I have in the back of my store and see if they match. 

&gt;$OL: What about fixing the old one? Are you able to do that?

&gt;$Me: Possibly, I'd still need to see it, where did it break exactly?

&gt;$OL: Right near the end, my daughter's brother in law already looked at it and he said he couldn't fix it. But can you?

&gt;$Me: If it's broken near the end, unlikely. I can't say yes or no until I see it.

&gt;$OL: Ok, I'll go grab it then.

She leaves, I return to browsing reddit and other important work related activities. She returns about 15 minutes later with another DC plugin that looks like it'd been through a wood chipper. the cable coming directly out of the power block is frayed and wire is spewing out everywhere. There are flathead screwdriver carvings all along the edges of it as if someone was trying to get into it. The actual charger tip looks like one side has been filed or sanded down so now the round tip looks more like a trapezoid.

&gt;$OL: So the brother-in-law tried to fix it. He wasn't able to. Can you fix it?

I stare at this charger for a couple more seconds before answering.

&gt;$Me: No, I can't do anything with this, but let me compare the tip to one of my old plugs in the back of the store.

I head to the back, see a couple that look pretty close to right, voltage and amps match up, should fit the baby monitor no problem. I show $OL The plugin and she is happy we have one like it. I explain that since it's a used cable and that the baby monitor was not here, I recommended she bring in the actual device(which she hasn't up to this point) to make sure it works for her before I sell my adapter to her. She agrees, and leaves again. After 15-20 minutes go by, $OL returns.

She drops a plastic bag on our counter with a few items in them. I inspect the goods and get a little confused. In the bag, is a cable modem from #ISP and a router.

&gt;$Me: Where's the baby monitor?

&gt;$OL: What do you mean?

&gt;$Me: This is a modem and router, the things that run the internet in the house.

&gt;$OL: Is that what those are? That explains why the internet hasn't been working in the house. I thought it was a baby monitor... What's a modem?

In the end, the adapter I had didn't work. I explained that she could get a replacement from #ISP on Monday when they are open, and that would fix the internet trouble.

TL;DR: Old Lady vacuumed a power cable, broke it, thought it was a baby monitor. Asked us to replace/fix it. Brought in the ""baby monitor"". It was a cable modem. I died a little inside.",talesfromtechsupport,1407,1521330277
TheITCustodian,Tesla vs Edison?,"TL;DR: due to a power outage, $BusinessManager wants ""wireless power.""

This was an actual conversation with a $LUser, a mid-level manager at $Company, and then $BusinessManager at $Company, following a pretty major storm that came thru on Thanksgiving weekend and knocked out power to over 100,000 across the region.

&gt;$LUser: ""I didn't get any emails from Friday morning until about 3pm yesterday.""

&gt;$Me: ""Yeah, looks like your site was without power or Internet until then.""

&gt;$LUser: ""Well, why didn't I get any emails?""

&gt;$Me: ""$Company's email is onsite, in the Exchange server in your server room. When the power cut off, eventually the server shut down after 15 or 20 minutes. With no power, no Exchange server, and thus no email.""

&gt;$LUser: ""Yeah, but the Internet still works.""

&gt;$Me: ""Not without power, it doesn't""

&gt;$LUser: ""The whole entire Internet around the world was NOT down because we had a power outage in $Town.""

&gt;$Me: ""No, you're right, but your email server was inaccessible because it was shut down, due to no power.""

&gt;$LUser: ""But the Internet still worked.""

&gt;$Me: ""Not at your site it didn't.""

&gt;$LUser: ""I don't think you know how the Internet works, do you?""

I manage to ignore this and our conversation turned to ways to mitigate loss of power and Internet at the $LUser's office.

&gt;$LUser: ""Well, since I had power at home, why can't I just get emails for everybody?""

&gt;$Me: ""Uh, wut?""

&gt;$LUser: ""Yeah, can't you just redirect emails to me in an emergency? I could then forward them to everybody else.""

&gt;$Me: ""That's not how on-premise email works in the event of a power or connectivity outage...""

Finally, after some explaining, I started to get some understanding from the $LUser of why cloud-based email for small businesses in areas prone to weather-related outages could be a really good thing.

&gt;$LUser: ""So our email would be delivered and managed someplace else in the world?""

&gt;$Me: ""Yeah, either on a Google server, or a Microsoft server, in a datacenter someplace where it gets backed up, redundant power, not affected by weather in this region, accessible from anyplace with an Internet connection like home or even a Starbucks or McDonalds.""

&gt;$LUser: ""Well, why don't we do that?""

&gt;$Me: ""It does cost money.."" (gives the user the figures for their number of users, mailboxes, etc)

&gt;$LUser: ""We'd never spend that! We already spent about $3,000 on the email server we have now.""

&gt;$Me: ""Sure. Over 4 years ago. Its going to be time to upgrade soon, and there is no upgrade path from Small Business Server 2007 to Server Essentials 2012 except with cloud-based email or licensing a separate Exchange server on-premise. And an on-prem server still puts you in the same boat you are now.""

&gt;$LUser: ""Well, thats pretty expensive. We'll just keep doing what we're doing, I think..""

&gt;$Me: (under my breath, channeling my mentor) ""And getting the results you always get.""

Later that afternoon, the $BusinessManager at the $Customer site called. She had clearly talked to $LUser but wasn't getting it.

&gt;$BusinessManager: ""Why was our server off over the weekend?""

&gt;$Me: ""Because like 160,000 people were without power across the state due to the weather. Your office lost power around 3:45am on Friday.""

&gt;$BusinessManager: ""But our power was on this morning.""

&gt;$Me: ""Then your utility company is earning its keep. But the power must have been off for an extended period on Friday through yesterday, based on the time we lost contact with the server and when it started checking in again.""

&gt;$BusinessManager: ""But....I had power at my house.""

&gt;$Me: ""Where do you live?""

&gt;$BusinessManager: [location about 15 miles from the $Company office]

&gt;$Me: ""Well, that part of the town had an outage. Yours didn't.""

&gt;$BusinessManager: ""But I thought we had wireless power.""

&gt;$Me: ""Uh, excuse me?""

&gt;$BusinessManager: ""You know, that uninterruptible thingy. That cost a lot of money.""

&gt;$Me: ""Yeah, like $800. It only keeps the server alive during brief power interruptions and shuts things down cleanly after the power has been out for an extended period.""

&gt;$BusinessManager: ""Well, this was a pretty brief interruption.""

&gt;$Me: ""By brief, I mean like 10-20 minutes, tops. Not 2 or 3 days.""

&gt;$BusinessManager: ""That seems kind of limiting, don't you think? If its uninterruptible, why can it shut down?""

&gt;$Me: ""Its a battery. You want longer term power capability, you need a generator.""

&gt;$BusinessManager: ""But we already paid for this thing.""

&gt;$Me: ""$300 for a UPS is a pittance. You want 2-3 days of continuious power in an outage, you need an emergency generator. Thats thousands.""

&gt;$BusinessManager: ""We're not spending one more dime on IT that we don't have to. You need to figure this out. We didn't pay $800 to have a power outage, you know.""

ditch_lily,when minor maintenance solves big problems,"Whoo. Been busy both at Small Sewing Machine Shop, and at the new job. Fortunately, it’s been pretty quiet. But there has been a situation brewing in the background at New Job, which finally blew up into a problem yesterday morning.

So, some technical background first. A flat locker (or flat seamer) is not, strictly speaking, a sewing machine. It, like a serger, is a *knitting* machine; that is, it knits its stitches around and through the fabric, which holds it together. Anything (and there are several others that do this) that has a multiple needles and a bottom looper (or more) falls into this category.

That said, they do have a fair amount of commonality with single-needle sewing machines. Like maintenance, for instance. Maintenance which includes, believe it or not, replacing the needles (ours have four) on a regular, scheduled basis. As a general rule, if you jam it hard enough to break one needle, you should replace all of them. Even if you don’t jam it, they still need to be replaced regularly; they are supposed to be sharp, and they do get dull and burred.

This hasn’t been happening. As near as I can tell, there have been no scheduled changes, only one-at-a-time-as-needed changes. The stitch quality, predictably, has been going noticeably down, and the machine has been misbehaving more.

**Me, several months ago:** Has anyone asked our Machine Overlords (the company that came in and set us up) for some sort of maintenance schedule? Owner’s manuals or service manuals?

**Boss:** *crickets* (To be fair, OverlordCo is not the best at responding to our requests, for anything, so it likely wouldn’t have mattered had she asked, and that probably factored into her not asking.)

**Me:** Well then, here’s what I recommend. *lays out maintenance schedule for machines, based on issues I’ve seen happen*

**Boss:** *crickets* (No excuse here!)

*insert wavy time jump here*

Remember Calvin’s skulls and daggers swearing? Picture a cloud of those growing around Tammi yesterday morning.

**Me:** What’s up?

**Tammi:** *waves terrible seam at me* Look! Look at this! This is horrible! It will never pass inspection. And I don’t understand WHY!!

**Me:** When was the last time the needles were changed, do you know?

**Tammi:** *thinks* I’ve changed one or two needles in the the other machine, but I don’t think I’ve ever changed any on this one, and I don’t know if anyone else has, either.

**Me:** Let’s change the needles, then, see where that gets us, before we do anything major.

Changing the needles on these things is a pain. They’re super close together, and up against a backing plate, so they have to be set and threaded with tweezers. And patience. And since no one has done it it much, no one has any practice at it. Much fiddling and swearing ensues, (sewing rooms are turning out to be much like commercial kitchens for, erm, creative expressions of frustration, shall we say) but finally it gets done.

**Tammi:** *inserts test fabric under foot, steps on pedal, gets beautiful, perfect seam* Holy shit! *That’s* all it took?! How often do I need to change the needles then? Because this has been a growing problem for the last couple of weeks or so. We’ve already failed a couple of garments because of their seam stitching.

**Me:** *lays out needle change schedule*

**Tammi:** *makes notes*

Tammi was changing the needles in the other flatlocker as I was leaving.

Lesson learned: Sometimes, it pays to go to the bottom of the totem pole to get things done, not the top.

thearmoredballerina,A New Computer Won’t Fix That,"A tale of unsecured networks and demands for new computers that won’t solve bad judgement... 

$Rep: A sales rep with no clue about computers other than how to turn it on (and sometimes that is pushing it). 

$Mr. Rep: $Rep’s sainted husband and the real hero of our tale. 

$AB: Yours truly

One evening, after I thought I was done for the day, one of my senior support reps calls me because $Rep is demanding a new computer and not taking no for an answer and neither is her manager. 

$AB: Hi, $Rep. I understand you want to escalate a request for a new computer. What seems to be the trouble?

$Rep: Mine doesn’t work. 

$AB: So, I’m looking at your ticket and it looks like you’ve not done any troubleshooting. Tell me more about the problem. 

$Rep: I keep getting a message a device wants to connect to my computer. I’m not trying to connect anything. I just need a new one. 

I’m mildly nauseated at this point because I realize why I thought her name looked familiar...we just sent her a new computer a few months prior...for a malware issue...that she claimed wasn’t being solved and was keeping her from working. 

I walk her through where to find the anti-badthings counter measures and convince her to run them while I prod for more info. She denies everything I ask her and the scans come back clean. The it hits me:

$AB: Have you worked remotely from anywhere other than home? 

$Rep: Yeah. A restaurant. 

$AB: Did they give you an access code or password to their WiFi? 

$Rep: No. What difference does that make? I don’t even have one at home, it’s just automatic. 

(A quick silent prayer to the technology gods to give me strength...) 

$AB: I need you to shut down your work computer right now. Did you buy your modem and/or router or did your internet provider give it to you? 

$Rep: I bought it. What does that have to with anything? I need a new computer. 

$AB: No, you need to secure your network. NOW. 

$Rep: I can’t. 

$AB: You...can’t. Do you have someone there that can? 

$Rep: No. Just send me a new computer!!! 

Her husband then asks who she’s yelling at. I tell her to put him on the phone. 

I then ask $Mr. Rep a few questions to gauge his level of tech savvy and somehow $Rep has convinced him she had a secure login, like a VPN, through work. $Rep kept complaining it “never worked” so he took it off and never got around to trying to fix it. I resist the urge to bang my head on the desk and then tell him exactly what he needs to do and set him off to call the router manufacturer for help. Since the router is not company-owned equipment and it’s in her home I can only give advice. 

Meanwhile, her manager has been messaging  me and asking when $Rep is getting a new computer. I call her and explain the situation. She seems OK with it so I sign off and go to bed. 

The next morning I have a barrage of messages from the Manager’s Manager demanding the tracking number for $Rep’s new computer. Cue facepalm. 

I ask one of my TSRs to call $Rep and verify her network security while I run interference with these two managers. Both of whom are adamant $Rep is supposed to be getting a new computer. I lay it on the line: 

TL;DR: Sales Rep uses not one, but two unsecured networks while working remotely and gets a persistent message asking permission to allow an unfamiliar device to connect to her computer. Her network security is now verified with screen shots, the device no longer shows up on her home network and the message no longer appears. $Rep has been reminded that she is REQUIRED to maintain a secure connection at all times. All is well, not getting a new computer. ",talesfromtechsupport,1219,1521250855
spaacequeen,"""How do I fix my water damaged phone?"" Well....","I work customer care over the phone and today I had a new tech listening to my calls. Customer dropped his phone in water and wanted me to fix it.

Me: you can put the phone in rice but the reality is water damage is like a ticking time bomb. It can kill your phone right away, or the damage may reveal itself months down the line. You may not have to get another phone right away, but you'll want to consider replacing it soon

Him: I don't get it. Why would my phone fail over time?

Me: think of your phone like the human body. It's made up of all these parts, and eventually one or more of those parts will age and fail. Water damage would be like injuring your body, and while your body might not fail in the moment, down the line you're at a higher risk for other issues.

He ponders this for a moment.

Him: so you're saying that the phone is like the human body... It's fine if my body gets wet, so why can't I put my phone in the water?

Me: sir, your body is an organic life form and your phone is electronic equipment. Water is fine for your body, but not for your phone.

TheITCustodian,"""Why can't you people understand? Its the VPN, dammit!""","This occurred at the same $EducationalNonProfit as my [previous tale](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/84hqad/this_one_was_worthy_of_dilberts_boss/?st=jeu1v2yx&amp;sh=5ef8beff).  With the same $LUser. 

This was right around the time we transitioned them from a hosted Microsoft Exchange through their old MSP to Office 365 and Exchange Online thru Microsoft. Because it was their ""slow period,"" and they didn't have a need for weekend email, the plan was to kick off the email transition on a Friday, and push the last of the mailbox contents ""from cloud to cloud"" over the weekend. 

We'd worked with $BusinessManager to inform the employees that their email would be in a state of transition over the weekend, and on Monday morning we'd have $FieldTech onsite to create new profiles, etc. *Everybody* was clued in. Except, of course, for our favorite $LUser. We assumed she was going to be a challenge because of her usual tendency to make assumptions based on a negative understanding of the tech, ignoring instructions and training, jumping to conclusions about causes and blame, and using lots of buzzwords in an attempt to sound smarter than she was.  I even had an indepth conversation with $BusinessManager and $LUser the week before the transition to set expectations. $BusinessManager totally got it. $LUser refused to.

The Support Line rings that Monday morning. Seeing the caller ID, I answer, expecting it to be $FieldTech calling from $EducationalNonProfit's site with a question.

&gt;Me: ""Good morning, $BigBossCompany, ITCustodian speaking.  How can I help you?""

&gt;$LUser: ""There is a problem with our VPN! This has been going on for 2 days!""

I recognize that its $LUser. Oh boy. I'm thanking my lucky stars that I assigned $FieldTech to visit this customer and that I'm not there. Dealing with $LUser in person on a Monday morning? No enough coffee in the world to prepare one for that.

&gt;$Me: ""Two days? What, hold on. Let me check this.  [Assuming she knows a VPN from a hole in the ground, I log in to $EducationalNonProfit's VPN via my laotop] Nope, your VPN is working fine. What are you trying to do?""

&gt;$LUser: ""I just sent myself an email and it didn't show up.""

&gt;$Me: ""Wait, what? No, $LUser, email has nothing to do with your office VPN. You remember that your office is in the middle of an email transition, right? Where did you send the email from?""

&gt;$LUser: ""My laptop.""

&gt;$Me: ""Which hasn't been setup with the new email profile yet.""

&gt;$LUser: ""I thought that was automatic?""

&gt;$Me: ""No, email is being delivered to Office 365 after Friday's cutover, and your laptop right now is still looking to the old hosted Exchange. Remember how we arranged to have all $EducationalNonProfit's laptops on site today so $FieldTech can point your laptop at the new Office 365 setup?""

&gt;$LUser: ""But, but...the VPN doesn't work!""

&gt;$Me: ""The VPN has nothing to do with your email and hasn't since $EducationalNonProfit switched off your on-site Exchange to that hosted Exchange email over a year ago.""

&gt;$LUser: ""No, thats not right. You don't know how our email is configured!""

&gt;$Me: (Inwardly) ""Oh, here we go again. $LUser accusing us of not doing our jobs.""

&gt;$Me: ""Oh? Hmmm. Perhaps you are right. Which part isn't configured right?""

&gt;$LUser: ""Well, to start with, the VPN doesn't work.""

&gt;$Me: ""I'm logged into your VPN right now. It is working fine. I just remoted into your file server. I'm also logged into your new Office 365 account and your mail is working and receiving emails.  $FieldTech is onsite, setting up the other laptops for the $OtherUsers in the office, so once he configures your profile to point to Office 365, you'll see that mail is working, hmmm?""

&gt;$LUser: ""Well, you better fix the VPN, too!""

There was no reason for her to even be trying to access the VPN. You usually can't hit a SonicWall VPN from inside the network, anyway, but there's no need to VPN into the site FROM the site, so I can't quite figure out what $LUser is trying to do. 

Later that morning, $LUser calls the support line again.  I'm not sure why she keeps calling the support line with $FieldTech right there. The office isn't that big. Its not like he's lost or something.  Remember, this is the $LUser who claims she doesn't want to call us for ""every little thing.""

&gt;$LUser: ""My contacts aren't on my phone! I told you the VPN was goofed up!""

&gt;$Me: ""Did $FieldTech setup your phone for Office 365?""

&gt;$LUser: ""Yes.""

&gt;$Me: ""Did he tell you it would take a few minutes for your phone to sync to Office 365 and some time for everything to appear on your phone?""

&gt;$LUser: ""Yes.""

&gt;$Me: ""And how long has it been since he setup your phone?""

&gt;$LUser: ""About 10 minutes.""

&gt;$Me: ""OK, this process isn't instantaneous. You actually have the biggest mailbox of anybody at $EducationalNonProfit, and likely your phone is still doing its initial sync with Office 365. Is $FieldTech still there?""

&gt;$LUser: ""He is. I told him there was a problem and he told me I had to wait for-""

&gt;$Me: ""Did he tell you that you had to wait for your email, contacts &amp; calendars to sync?""

&gt;$LUser: ""Yes! I also sent myself an email from my personal account and I haven't gotten it yet!""

&gt;$Me: (checking $LUser's inbox via the web interface) ""I see that test email in your Office 365 inbox on the cloud. The reason your phone hasn't gotten it yet is that it is still syncing stuff and hasn't caught up yet.""

&gt;$LUser: ""Its because the VPN is screwed up, isn't it?""

&gt;$Me: ""Can you find $FieldTech and put him on the phone for a minute, please?""

$LUser &lt;hands over phone to tech, who is apparently standing right there&gt;

&gt;$Me: ""Is it still syncing?""

&gt;$FieldTech: ""Yep. The other phones have gotten their contacts from 365, no reason to expect this one won't except for the volume of mail being sync'd.""

&gt;$Me: ""If she continues on about this contacts thing, offer to wipe her phone to factory as the only option.""

&gt;$FieldTech: (laughing) ""Will do!""

Later that afternoon, the support line rings. Its $LUser again.

&gt;$LUser: ""I sent myself an email from my $EducationalNonProfit account to my personal account and I haven't gotten it yet!""

&gt;$Me: ""Where did you send it from?""

&gt;$LUser: ""My laptop.""

&gt;$Me: ""Can I remote into your laptop? Hmmm, wait, I can't remote in, it doesn't show that it is online.""

&gt;$LUser: ""I disconnected it from the wifi.""

&gt;$Me: ""Why?""

&gt;$LUser: ""Because I want to connect to the VPN!""

&gt;$Me: ""Well, you can't just connect to the VPN-""

&gt;$LUser: ""Ah ha! I've been telling you all along the VPN was screwed up.""

&gt;$Me: ""No, you can't connect to the VPN because you actually need to be connected to *some kind of network connection* to get to the VPN. Doesn’t matter, because as you know, you can't connect to the VPN from inside the $EducationalNonProfit network. You have to be outside the $EducationalNonProfit network to connect to the VPN.""

&gt;$LUser: ""Now you're just making up excuses.""

A little while later, my $FieldTech called from the road on his way back to the office. 

&gt;$FieldTech: ""$LUser complained constantly about her contacts.""

&gt;$Me: ""And?""

&gt;$FieldTech: ""I told her she had to wait a bit for them to sync up, its not instant.""

&gt;$Me: ""And the contacts eventually sync'd, right? How long did it take?""

&gt;$FieldTech: ""Maybe 5 more minutes after she initially complained. She kept saying over and over that I screwed up her phone.""

&gt;$Me: ""What about the emails she kept sending herself?""

&gt;$FieldTech: ""She would click send on an email from her Gmail account, and then, before the email had even left the outbox, she was frantically clicking send and receive on her laptop, on her desktop, and refresh on her phone. When she didn't see the email in like 5 seconds, she kept insisting something was wrong.""

&gt;$Me: ""Did you tell her that email takes a little bit to go from A to B?""

TheRobbstar,The ten-kilometer wlan repeater,"I hope this story will fit here otherwise feel free to remove it.

This is a tale back from my internship at a big store for all kind of technical stuff for private users. The store offered everything from a toaster to an flat screen.

I worked at the computer section of the store, with all kind of computers, monitors, tablets and devices for your home network.

It was a normal day, until two customers come in and asked for help. One of them wanted to buy something and the other one was there and tried to translate. Sadly, this didn’t help, because both didn’t speak german quiet well.

For the understanding we will just put them together as $CC.

$CC: Hello, we need help!

$Me: Hi, how can I help you?
 
$CC: I need some sort of wlan expansion device.

$Me: Okay, so you mean a wlan repeater. We have many different devices. Do you now the range that you want to expand?

$CC: I want to use my wlan at work.

*thinking that his office is maybe at another floor at his house*

$Me: Ok, how far is the work away from your router?

$CC: Ehm, maybe ten kilometers?

$Me: Ten kilometers? So your work is not at your home?

$CC: No, I have to drive there.

$Me: Sorry, but I don’t think there is a repeater or another solution, that we offer, which can handle that range. 

He looked a little sad and left the store with his friend.
 
This whole conversation took about half an hour, with a lot of hand signals and pointing at stuff.

TL:DR Customer wants a wlan repeater, to use his home Wi-Fi at work, ten kilometers away

For a period of approximately two months we were having an intermittent, yet frustratingly persistent issue with lane 15. What was happening, was that occasionally the pinsetter would cycle twice consecutively, resulting in the bowler having their spare swept away and then us mechanics getting a call to set it back up. Most of our open play customers don't really care about sticking to the rules and will just ignore those issues, but we did have a small league that used 15 &amp; 16 every week. They are possibly the worst league I have ever worked as far as problems go, with multiple issues caused by bowler error *on every lane they use* while they're bowling. For the first week or two, I just brushed off these respot calls as another symptom caused by this particular group of bowlers.

However, once it was brought to my attention that the machine was double cycling during a particularly troublesome day for lane 15, I began my diligent troubleshooting. Most importantly, I wanted to watch it happen with my own eyes, since any of a number of different problems could cause double cycling as a symptom and it's important to know which ones can be eliminated as culprits as quickly as possible.

The problem was, it was so intermittent and unpredictable that after another week of watching over it I had yet to see it actually occur. As far as I could tell, the machine was running just fine, and only the *User Error League* was having problems with it. Skeptical as I was though, as I prepared my $BeAmateur camera to monitor it, it finally happened while I was watching, in fact, several times. This let me confirm that it was indeed a technical issue as well as give me the first information I had about the nature of it.

**The Context**

I've described our computerized scoring system, $OldScoring, in a previous story, but for the sake of simplicity I'll go over it again real quick. Each pair of lanes has a few modules installed to perform all of the scoring functions. Between the lanes on the gutter capping is the **camera module ($CM)** which takes a photo of the pins so the system can determine what pins remain standing each turn. Also mounted between lanes under the graphic wall and just in front of the pinsetters are a pair of **ball detect ($BD)** infrared beam sensors and reflectors, which allow the system to detect a ball passing by. Above the pinsetters on the wall is the **curtain wall chassis ($CWC)** which interprets all the information from the different modules and the bowler's keypad, and calculates the scores to display on screen. And finally, technically part of each pinsetting machine, is the **time delay ($TDM)** module, which is set to wait between 2 to 5 seconds to allow pins to fall before allowing the pinsetter to be cycled after a ball is thrown.

The interface between pinsetter and scoring is painfully simple, literally just a single component called the **cycle solenoid**. All this solenoid is, is an electromagnet that pulls in a steel plunger when activated, and in this case that plunger pulls on the lever that starts the pinsetter's cycle. That's the only part of the machine the scoring computer interacts with. One could actually install an evil malevolent AI in our scoring computers and the only thing it would be able to do is start the pinsetter's cycle. So consider bowling machines future-proof in that regard.

**The Problem**

With this particular type of pinsetting machine, nearly every function is controlled through some kind of mechanical force or connection. That kind of complexity means there are many, many issues which can cause one to cycle twice, or run past the end of a cycle into the next one, or stop suddenly mid cycle, etc. However, the moment I saw the cycle solenoid pull and begin a second unwanted cycle I was able to eliminate every single one of those entirely. The only thing that would cause the solenoid to energize would be an electrical issue, most likely relating to the scoring system somehow. And after watching the problem happen several times, I noted how it would suspiciously happen shortly after finishing the previous cycle, nearly an identical amount of time after as the setting on the $TDM.

**The Eventual Solution**

Well, armed with this knowledge that the scoring system was responsible for the occasional double cycle, I immediately lost all hope of being able to solve it. Not quite, but it did mean that the issue lay in a system I still didn't understand very well, and which we had few, if any replacement parts for. However, it needed to get solved, so I started my troubleshooting with the simple things first. Having noted how similar the amount of time between cycles was to the time delay setting, I replaced the $TDM with a brand new one we had ordered the month before. With a little bit of free time, I tested it by bowling two games and the issue seemed to be gone, although at this early stage I was still skeptical of our User Error League.

However, the issue remained and the next day I came in to a long note about how many problems it had caused the evening after my first repair attempt. Now with even less of an idea of where to look than before, I decided to switch into ""throw parts at the problem"" mode, and decided to go straight to replacing the $CWC. These things have caused all manner of strange issues in the past and we've had to replace them regularly. But being a system first released in the early 1980's, working replacements are difficult to find and the huge number of unusable $CWCs we had piled up in the back meant I had no good spares. So after a couple weeks of fixing more important issues that kept popping up, I decided to do a part swap with a known working $CWC on another pair of lanes. Lane 3 was down at this point with an extremely serious issue (similar to needing the engine and transmission in a car replaced) so I swapped the $CWC from 3/4 with that from 15/16 to see if the problem would move. This time I did my due diligence, and bowled 5 games without a single instance of the double cycling problem showing up. I considered the problem solved.

That evening, however, the bowlers didn't. In fact the issue came back with a vengeance, happening as often as every 3 or 4 frames at times. I felt completely defeated. I'd replaced the only two parts of the scoring system that I knew of that controlled machine cycling, and in 7 games of testing had never seen the issue return. While my attention was once again focused on more serious issues, I instructed my more senior mechanic to try swapping the $BD sensors with another pair next. After this, I was out of options as far as I could tell. All the camera did was take photos, and the keypad the bowlers used could only cycle the machine if they pressed a 3 button sequence, so it was pretty much impossible they were still the cause. In fact, the reset buttons on the ball rack had long ago been disabled by the prior mechanic to stop such nonsense.

The double cycling continued. Leagues were moved to avoid them having to use the problem pair of machines. About this same time I was called into a meeting with my boss $GM, and his boss, about the huge number of problems that had been occurring lately and the slow, or sometimes non-existent repair time. Some problems were being left for weeks or months, simply because our mechanical staff was being overwhelmed, but of course it was my responsibility to prevent that from happening. It was revealed that the User Error League was planning not to return for the next league season because of the persistent issues, which we were all secretly glad to hear, but it did mean lost business and that meant someone had to be disciplined. It was the lowest part of my year.

After another several weeks of ignoring 15 so more important things could be done, I was instructed by $GM that the issue had to be solved quickly because we were approaching our tournament season and would need every lane we had to be working. I was as discouraged as it was possible to be, since we had replaced every part of the scoring system except for the $CM, which I knew wasn't the cause. But at this point I was out of options, and so I spent an entire 8 hour shift swapping cameras between pairs, calibrating them, testing them, then swapping back and repeating the process over again to be sure they were still usable. I made zero progress, other than to finally have the double cycling problem happen during my testing on game 6. I don't know why it took me 11 games of testing to see the issue myself when everyone else had it as often as multiple times per game, but at least I was able to reproduce it and determine the camera swap had no effect.

Another week, and another pleasant reminder from $GM that it had to be solved ASAP later, and I found myself back on 15, with a scoring problem that couldn't be solved even by replacing the entire scoring system for that lane. The only thing that hadn't been replaced at this point was the five or six hundred feet of wiring that ran back and forth between all the different modules, so that was my last hope. I remembered seeing the wire bundle leading to the $BD sensors was split open at one spot, so I decided to work on that first. None of the wires inside were damaged however, at least not visually, but the wire was hanging down in the path of the ball as it rolls down from the pinsetters to below the lanes. So, while I was there I decided to clean up some of the loose wires that ran through the area so they wouldn't get damaged by the balls again.

And that was when something odd caught my eye. Right where the sloped ball track dips down below the lanes and underneath the $BD, were little fragments and scrapings of bowling balls. It's incredibly frustrating to be unable to find what the cause is when a customer's ball is damaged, so a find like this with a bunch of different colored pieces of ball was rare and noteworthy. I had located an unknown source of ball damage during my futile attempt to fix 15's double cycling. I decided to fix it right then and there, since I was making no progress on the scoring issue. Shining my flashlight down the ball track under the $BD, I could see a brace made of 2x4 and only in place to keep the long boards that ran alongside the gutters the proper distance apart, that looked like it had been attacked with a sledge hammer. It was splintered, beaten, and dislodged, and presumably was the thing the balls were hitting that was causing the damage.

A quick trip to the shop to retrieve the ""test ball"" later and I was able to confirm that every ball traveling down the track to the bowler would just barely hit this wooden brace on the way by. But to my complete shock, when I pushed the ball past it, it pushed the brace and the long board it was mounted to upwards. All of the wooden bracing and ""cribbing"" as it's called between and under the lanes is supposed to be rock solid and not move under any stress short of a very determined sledge hammer. However, the years and years of beatings this brace had endured from bowling balls had broken loose the nails holding down the long board alongside lane 15, allowing it to be pushed upwards with each passing ball. And suddenly, the eureka moment hit me.

The ball detect mounts to the top of both long boards. Lane 16's long board was still solidly mounted, but 15's wasn't any longer, so whenever a ball pushed its way past it would lift just the one side, tilting the sensors enough that 15's would briefly lose signal and assume a ball had been thrown. It explained everything perfectly. It was so intermittent and random because not every ball would hit the brace hard enough to trigger the $BD. It was only lane 15 because 16's cribbing had not broken loose. Lane 15 would cycle the same amount of time as the time delay later because it really was running through the time delay as if a ball had been thrown.

It never ceases to amaze me, that with all the capabilities of technology these days and just how much of that capability exists only in a virtual space, that physical forces are often still the cause of our virtual problems. Here I was replacing an entire pair of lanes' worth of scoring equipment due to *an errant piece of wood*. All that was needed to correct the issue was to remove the damaged brace and install a new one in the form of a flat piece of plywood that the ball couldn't hit, then screw back down the long board that had pulled its nails out. In just about an hour of work, I stopped two months worth of headaches and scoring problems with a handsaw and electric screwdriver.

I have no fear of the upcoming takeover of sentient AI and robotic warlords because I know that no matter how sophisticated our technology gets, it will always be vulnerable to simple things like a stray piece of wood.

TheITCustodian,How do I know its Monday? Crazy CFO Lady is on the horn.,"While at $BigBossCompany, we had a $Customer that was, how can I put this gently? $CluelessNonProfit.

On some random Monday morning following our monthly maintenance cycle with them, I get a call.

&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: ""When you do our monthly backup, we have this problem where Quickbooks goes into single-user mode.""

&gt;$Me: ""Uh, what? I do monthly maintenance on the server, but thats not backups. You have *nightly* backups.""

&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: ""No, you're wrong. The last two months we've had this problem."" 

&gt;(Unspoken: ""...and we're just telling you now"") 

&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: ""The backups aren't happening. Every time you do that monthly backup thing, I have to go back and put Quickbooks in multi-user host mode.""

As I'm remoting in, my eye twitches. Did she say 'multi-user host mode'? 

&gt;$Me: ""No, the backups are working just fine. What did you say, you're putting Quickbooks in multi-user mode? Can I see what you're doing? Please demonstrate.""

&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: ""I go here and click Utilities and then Start Multi-user hosting.""

&gt;$Me: ""Why are you doing that? You have the Quickbooks server, and that is doing the multi-user hosting for the whole organization. When you do what you just did, you're making *your* machine the server.""

&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: ""No, no, you don't know what you're talking about. ***I know all about Quickbooks***.""

Now mind you, I really don't know shit about the intricacies of non-profit finance and all that. But I've been supporting Quickbooks thru its various versions, in multi-user situations, for several years. I understand how Quickbooks is *supposed* to work. (and for some reason, this outfit had just switched from Peachtree to Quickbooks, still not sure why, so this was a very fresh implementation of new software. Not some crufty old patch-upon-patch situation where they changed ways of doing things mid-stream or something)

&gt;$Me: ""OK, but this means you could be corrupting the Quickbooks file, and you're not using the multi-user hosting via the server. It reverts to single-user mode because you're leaving your Quickbooks file open at the end of the day when we're doing monthly maintenance and not closing it.""

&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: ""Why should I close it?""

&gt;$Me: ""Hmmm, lets think. How about the notification email I send out 2 days and then 1 day in advance of the maintneance window that says 'Please close all apps with files open to the server before the maintenance window'?""

&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: ""You don't know what you're saying, we don't have a Quickbooks server!""

&gt;$Me: ""Yes, you do. And by the way, here is the link to the Intuit documentation on the subject. See here where it says that you're not supposed to turn on hosting on the workstations? And here's the link to the documentation I sent you, and stored on your server, following the implementation.""

&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: ""Oh, that information isn't right. We don't have a server. My computer is the server.""

&gt;$Me: ""OK, no. We had this conversation 3 months ago when we converted you from Peachtree to Quickbooks. Everybody should be opening the shared file on the server. Where it gets backed up. Using the Quickbooks Server Manager and the multi-user features of the server. Thats the way we set this up in March, and the entire department was working that way when we turned it over to you. And you said 'I know how this all works, I've used Quickbooks for years'.""

&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: ""But that's not the way it worked at my last company.""

&gt;$Me: ""Did you have a domain server at your last company?""

&gt;$CluelessNonProfit.Clueless CFO: ""No, it was just two PCs. And my PC was the server.""

&gt;$Me: ""Well, now you’re at a place with dozens of PCs, 5 of which are in the Finance Department, including yours,  and are running the Quickbooks client and talking to the file server in the back room that is hosting the Quickbooks file and using the Quickbooks server component to manage access. You're in a totally different environment here.""

Turns out that she’d convinced 2 of the people in Finance to connect to “her copy” of the company books hosted on her PC, while the other two people in Finance, including the payroll clerk, were still (correctly) communicating to the server-based version. Receivables and some other stuff were in one version of the Quickbooks books, and payables and payroll were in another. Suddenly (at the end of the quarter is my guess), none of the numbers matched up.

The $Clueless CFO and the two clerks had to spend three days manually re-entering all the deposits and receivables they’d originally entered in the wrong version to the server-hosted Quickbooks file.

The worst part is, the next day the $CluelessNonProfit.$ExecutiveDirector called me up in a tizzy because her quarterly financial report to the board was going to be “late” and it was because “you didn’t backup the server” and “I’m going to have to tell the board that your company isn’t doing its job.”

I had to go back thru the whole thing and walk her thru it step by step:

* how the Quickbooks server component works; 
* how it was setup *correctly* three months prior (and documented, both in a document emailed to $ExecutiveDirector, $CluelessCFO and the rest of the Finance Dept at the completion of the work, and also kept in the Finance share, under ""Quickbooks Documentation"");
* how *two* of the five people in Finance were using it the way it was intended to be used and by the documentation; and 
* how the $CluelessCFO had gotten confused by the way she’d used Quickbooks at her prior company and went off the reservation. 
 
(I held back the part where I realized that I’d learned more in the finance course I took in college than this “CFO” knew about finance *entirely*)

About 30 days later I got a call from this $CluelessNonProfit to deactivate the $CluelessCFO’s account while she was being frog-marched out the door.  Turns out, this entire episode, including my documentation for all the work I had to do to fix her screw up, was used as the reason to get rid of her.

Raffles7683,"How a user killed a £2500 workstation, and - naturally - blamed me.","Hi TFTS, 

A time ago, I used to build computers for people, and by the end of my tenure doing so, I had built perhaps 30 systems. 

There are just two protagonists. $Me and $User. Simple. I now work in IT full time, but this was a little while before I started my new role. 

Should also say that there are little bits cut out here and there, in order to shorten the tale, otherwise it would have definitely gone into XL territory.

This was a late 2017 project, and we had been in communication for about 2 weeks by the day of the build. I'll explain that - for the most part - I built the systems at the person's house, usually because they were interested in the process but too worried about breaking something to do it on their own. 

The man in question had a lot to spend, and it was to be a top of the line video production PC. After deliberating, he decided on Intel's then new X299 'Skylake-X' lineup. I couldn't blame him, as he was a bit of a gamer and clearly had money to burn. 

System built, up and running, working sweet as a nut. I dialled in a very conservative overclock on the CPU (i7 7820X, for those wanting to know) using a 'safe' voltage, as well as enabling the XMP profiles on the memory. I also did the same to his GPU, a reference Nvidia GTX 1080Ti. 

I should say that for the clocks I used on the CPU, I did use a bit more core voltage than was necessary, but I wanted a buffer zone. This system was, I will say, solid as a rock.

This one... this was a doozy. 

***

My phone rings, it's 5:30pm on a Sunday, and whilst I made it clear I don't take Sunday calls, I recognised his number. We got along ok and I had helped him with a couple of questions he'd had in the past, so I didn't mind. 

* **$Me**: 'Hel...'
* **$User**: 'It's dead. The PC is f**king dead. Just come fix it.' 
* **$Me**: 'Ok woah, what? How did it die?' 
* **$Use**r: 'I haven't got time (*classic line, that one*) to explain. Just please get over here. I have a project. 

I should note that I had given extensive advice about keeping backups on external drives, NAS(es), or using cloud based storage. I had also given VERY specific instructions not to f**k with anything in the BIOS. Ever. 

I will not bore you with the details, but I eventually got it out of him that the PC turned on, then immediately powered off, and there was a funny smell in the air. 

I get there to what can only be described as a human between the states of indescribable rage, and stricken panic. 

* **$User**: 'Thank god. How could this happen? It's not good enough. How can it just die? I paid you decent money for this.' 
* **$Me**: 'I understand, I do. However, please let me take a look first before we jump to any conclusions.'

*Remain calm + be diplomatic. IT 101 right there.*

* **$User**: 'Whatever. You built it, fix it.'

I didn't say anything, but I was already really irked at his tone. Something, somewhere, told me that he wasn't being honest. 

I open the PC up, and I didn't even have to walk into the room to smell 'that' smell of burned electronics. We've all smelled it. I was about to start work when I noticed that the smell was coming directly from near the CPU socket... again, oh *very* dear indeed. 

Ok, so immediately I think to myself 'Either this motherboard's power delivery is toast, or we're looking at a fried processor here.' In 2017, that is a very hard thing to do. Before I did anymore testing, time to get some more info...

* **$Me**: 'I think I know what the problem is. Either the CPU or motherboard have burned out, judging by where the smell is coming from, and the symptoms seem to back that up. $User, did you do *anything* to the PC prior to shutting it down?' 
* **$User**: 'No, I shut it down last night. Went to turn it on before you came, and it did that. Just died. I thought you said this was stable?'  

I didn't say anything. I knew the settings I used were entirely safe, so fault had to go down to hardware. 

I unmounted the significantly sized air cooler attached to the CPU, and could see no damage. Turned the PC around and still, no damage. Visible damage, anyway. Still the smell and symptoms were pretty conclusive. 

I did some more poking around. Tested the PSU with a paperclip, tested the memory in his living room PC, etc. It was all fine. 

* **$Me**:'$User, I hate to say it, but there is a very strong chance that either your CPU or motherboard are dead. Something has burned it out. Either a power surge here or too much power going through it...' 

Suddenly the user looked down at his feet, shifting a little. 

* **$Me**: '...Are you sure you didn't change anything?' 
* **$User**: 'Well I saw a video online about how to get more out of your system, so.' 

Boom. He could have said not a word more, and I would have put the rest together. My failing in this sorry endeavour was not to put an admin password on the UEFI.

* **$Me**: 'Did you try and change the settings?'
* **$User**: '...yes, I know you said you were very conservative for it to be more stable, but I wanted it to be faster.'
* **$Me**: 'So you did what I said not to? What did you change?' 
* **$User**: 'Well I looked at a quick guide, and it said you had to raise voltage to raise the speed.'
* **$Me**: 'What did you type in?' 
* **$User**: 'I thought it would be ok, as you said the cooler was very good, so I typed 1.8. I increased the speed, then did 'save and exit.' 

S**t. 1.8v. It's dead. At this point, he had calmed down a lot, and seemed to have accepted his fate. 

* **$Me**: '$User, there is very little chance the CPU has survived that, I will be honest with you. Your best hope is that the motherboard's power delivery array has survived, and that all you have lost is the CPU.' 

He gulped, but said nothing. I think it was shock at his own idiocy. 

***

This tale ends ok, however. The CPU was confirmed dead when his new one worked fine. I made sure to scold him just enough so that the same would never happen again, and thanked my lucky stars that the end of my complimentary call/support service for builds was coming to an end.

072751,A wholesome tech support story from my workplace.,"I work in a small tech repair shop that mostly fixes smartphones and computers, with the occasional console repair. An elderly woman came in today and I greeted her in my usual upbeat, happy tone, but as soon as she looked up I could tell she was visibly distraught. I asked her what the problem was, and she held up an iPhone 7, missing the SIM card tray, but I could see that a SIM card was jammed into the phone.

The phone powered on, but wouldn't boot properly, and I told her it was probably a simple fix, that I just needed her to sign a paper authorizing me to take her device back to my desk.

She's so upset that she can hardly speak, instead handing me driver's license to enter her name into the computer. I tell her to sit down in our lobby and relax, because it won't be long. She hands me a SIM card that she wants to go in the phone, and the SIM card tray. The Apple Store apparently told her she would simply need to get a new phone, and the sales rep at her carrier store (who supposedly inserted the SIM card without the tray) refused to attempt fixing it.

I take the phone back to my desk, open it up, disconnect the battery and display cables, then peel back the cover of the SIM card slot. I push the SIM card out, put in the SIM tray holding the new one, then reassemble her phone. Takes all of five minutes.

I turn her phone on and it boots properly, then I go out to the lobby, sit down next to her, and hand her the working phone. She breathes an enormous sigh of relief and asks me how much for the service; I tell her that because I was able to fix the device in such a short period requiring no parts, that there's no charges due.

She profusely thanks me, asks if she can have a hug, to which of course I say yes. She signs our paperwork stating that she picked up her device, and left the shop much happier than when she came in.

Nothing major, but a nice reminder about why I go to work everyday; because lots of people actually do care about their devices, for whatever reason, and it's not just idiots owning things with a power button.",talesfromtechsupport,748,1520654544

$Me: Yours truly

$Cx: Customer

So I had finished building his pc and tested it, everything seems normal customer picks up their Pc that night. 

I come into work the next day and right at opening he's there. His PC wasn't able to boot into windows. Plop it on my test bench and it works just fine. I notice that in the BIOS the USB port is first in the order. Odd, we normally swap the HDD to be the first thing to boot, but whatever, I change it back. I ask him if he had a printer connected and sure enough he did. I explain that printers can sometimes cause the computer not to boot if it's connected over USB and that it should be fine now.

Customer goes home everything is happy. I get a call about 4 hours later. Same guy his computer isn't working. Hmmmm

&gt;$Me: ""Is the printer plugged in again?""

&gt;$Cx: ""Yeah""

&gt;$Me: ""Ok, try unplugging it""

It works. Ok, so maybe the setting didn't save in the BIOS.

&gt;$Me: ""Ok, I think it might be the printer but I'd like to have you bring in the PC once more to double check.""

&gt;$Cx: ""Alright""

So I open up the BIOS and sure enough USB is the first boot option. I move it down the list and save it. Reboot to double check and call it good.

&gt;$Me: ""It looks like that setting didn't save for some reason, but it should be fine now""

&gt;$Cx: ""It better be. I'm getting sick of coming here for my computer.""

End of story, right? NOPE! Next morning I come in and the customer is looking pissed. Ok, let's check it out. I see that setting is changed again. I know it saved properly, and so I'm a little suspicious.

&gt;$Me: ""Have you been changing this setting by any chance?""

&gt;$Cx: ""Oh yeah, the guide I have for new computers says to do that.""

&gt;$Me: ""Well if that setting's first it won't boot if your printer is plugged in. Is there a USB that you're trying to boot from?""

&gt;$Cx: ""Nope it just says to do that in the guide.""

&gt;$Me: ""Ok, well don't do that. It's going to cause your computer not to boot. Just skip that step.""

&gt;$Cx: ""Well this guide is written by a professional""

&gt;$Me: ""I'm sure. But I'm telling you this is what's causing it""

Customer leaves and I figure everything is hunky-dory. Customer learned something, I solved a mystery, and we're good to go. Then I come back from my lunch to see him back in once more. Shit.

&gt;$Me: ""Did something else pop up?""

&gt;$Cx: ""It's doing the same thing!""

&gt;$Me: ""Did you change the setting again?""

&gt;$Cx: ""It said to in the guide.""

&gt;$Me: ""Ok hold on, I was reading on this after you left and I think I found a solution.""

I took the PC into the back. Went into the BIOS and just put a BIOS password on it. Saved it in the notes on the customer and sent him on his way. I never heard back from him.",talesfromtechsupport,1835,1520630555
fshannon3,"""I have everything plugged in, but my laptop won't turn on.""","This tale is a recent tale...it happened on my first day of my current job in IT. I was ""warned"" beforehand that there would be a lot of hand-holding when it comes to tech as a majority of the employees are of the older generation and they've spent most of their career without technology so all this tech that they're using now can be a bit overwhelming for them. No worries, that's what I'm there for.

So, like I said, first day on the new gig and my first issue that comes up. Nice enough lady...she comes to track me down, introduces herself, and then proceeds to explain how her laptop isn't turning on and that she has everything plugged in. I go to investigate.

I see a workstation-sized laptop sitting on her desk with a seemingly rat's nest of cabling coming out of both sides. I start tracing out cables to see what's what...I see the VGA and HDMI cables going to the 2 monitors, the USB cables going to the keyboard, mouse, USB hub, and printer...but I don't seem to see any cord for a power supply. Thinking I may have missed the power connection, I double check the connections for some different type of connector I may be unaware of, and then ask her if she's got the power supply available.

She says, ""Oh, yeah...it's in my bag. Do I need that?"" I explain how the battery probably doesn't have any charge so that's why it isn't powering up. She plugs up the power supply and voila, it turns on. She laughs and apologizes and says she thought it had some charge on it before she left the house that morning, etc.

A week or so later she asked me about how she could clean up the cables and I suggested a docking station. She got one last week, we hooked it up, and she's much happier that her desk now lacks the clutter of all the cabling.",talesfromtechsupport,1722,1520559790

I ask him to look along the taskbar for any other blue icons. ""There's a blue and white O. Are you telling me that's it?"" I ask him to confirm that Outlook begins with the letter O, and advise him to try clicking on that icon instead.

So he clicks on it, and ta-da! Outlook opens. ""Oh for God's sake. This is too confusing. Why did you change the colour anyway? Now I have to re-arrange all my appointments, this is really inconvenient.""

Sorry, I did ring up my mate Bill and ask him to change the colour of Outlook from orange to blue just to confuse you. Luckily I have great power and influence over at Microsoft, so they did me a favour, and I'm now reaping the untold rewards.

IDidntBreakIt,Show up late + Start a fire = Get a raise?,"Hello TFTS.  This happened about 3 and a half years ago while I was still an intern and was probably the single worst … best … most interesting day I ever had working with my employer at the time.

&amp;nbsp;

The players in this story are Me – Self explanatory, Boss – My manager at the time, VP – The VP of sales for the company

&amp;nbsp;

The day started with me laying in my bed awoken by the loud repeated chirping of my cell phone ringer.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Me: This is $Me

&gt;Boss: Hi $Me, I just wanted to check in and make sure that you were ok because we haven’t seen you at the office yet this morning

&amp;nbsp;

I rolled over and looked at my clock, it’s flashing 9:05 … I’m over an hour late for work and I live a half hour away.
&amp;nbsp;
&gt;Me: Aww crap, I overslept.  I’ll be there in about an hour

&gt;Boss: Alright, get here when you can.

&amp;nbsp;

I hang up the phone take a quick shower and get dressed.  I grab a muffin on my way out the door and I get to work at about 10.
Before I have even made it to my desk I get stopped by $VP.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;VP: Hey, $Me.  My tablet isn’t connecting to my keyboard or my dock.  Can you take a look at that for me?

&amp;nbsp;

I nod my head

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Me: Bring the tablet, dock, and keyboard over to my desk and I’ll take a look.

&amp;nbsp;

A few minutes later $VP arrives with the requested items and at a quick glance I see what his problem likely is, the tablet and dock are filthy.  Ports are full of gunk and the tablet screen is so smudged that you can barely see anything on it.  I let VP know that I will take a look and let him know when I am finished, probably about 45 minutes to an hour.

&amp;nbsp;

I take the next half hour to carefully clean the gunk out of all of the ports using a plastic pick tool that I had handy and compressed air from a little compressor that I had at the work bench.  Having gotten as much out as it seemed possible I tried to connect the keyboard and it of course worked.  After that I thought it would be a good idea to confirm that the dock worked as well but I had no doubts that it would.  I hooked up the dock and that was when the day got worse.

&amp;nbsp;

A 4 inch jet of flame came shooting out of the joint where the dock and the tablet connected, the tablet flickered off and the dock started to melt.  I quickly grabbed the power cord for the dock and yanked it from the wall with an explicative shout

&amp;nbsp;

Hearing me swear, Boss comes running over to see what is going on.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Boss: $Me, what’s going on, are you alright?

&gt;Me: I’m fine $Boss.  I was cleaning up $VP’s tablet and when I put it back on the dock it started on fire

&amp;nbsp;

$Boss looks at the charred and slightly melted dock with a silent look of awe.  I wander over to $VP’s office to let him know what happened.  Surprisingly he just laughs and says that he will take a replacement when we can get one but not to worry about rushing it.

&amp;nbsp;

Having informed $VP of the fate of his tablet I then get on the phone with the vendor to try making a warranty claim – After sending a number of pictures of the tablet and dock they accept it but it takes me 3 hours of being on the phone with them, mostly to fill out what seemed to be insurance paperwork.

&amp;nbsp;

After hanging up the phone $Boss walks over and says we need to have a chat and heads off to the server room; we usually had short private conversations in there because it was easier than trying to get one of the conference rooms for a 10 minute talk.  I figured that this was where I was going to get let go or at the very least raked over the coals for the way that the day had gone so far.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Boss: $Me, you know that we really like having you working here and you have been a great help.
&gt;Me: Thanks $Boss, it’s been a pleasure working here so far. (Internally I’m just thinking that I’m about to be let go)
&gt;Boss: I know that today has not been a typical day for you and has gone a bit off the rails …
&gt;Me: I know and I’m sor-
Boss cuts me off before I can say any more
&gt;Boss: But we aren’t here to talk about that

&amp;nbsp;

I’m slightly confused at this point, unsure of what is going on.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Boss: We talked previously about you wanting more hours and we would like to give them to you as well as a raise because you have been doing excellent work

&amp;nbsp;

$Boss and I talked for another 15 minutes while I was told what was given the offer and accepted.  All told I ended up getting the hours I wanted and a 50% raise.  Despite the way the day started, I have to say that it ended on a high note.",talesfromtechsupport,3451,1520183948
The_Lone-Wanderer,"No, I can't move the Mt.Everest of obsolete technology out of here that quickly with no IT budget.","So for the last few months I worked for a regional tax service with 45 offices and I was at there main building where they had been storing there obsolete equipment basically since the turn of the century. 

Anywho, we round everything up and there are 50+ 17"" CRT monitors as old as 1994, probably 100 capacitor plague ridden Optiplex GX and SX series PCs, another 100 various Athlon64 based machines (all of these are the wonderful USFF models with the CPU fans integrated into the hard drive bay), another 50 Intel versions of the USFF 700 series machine, around 50 assorted computers from the late 90s (Pentium IIIs, not cheapos either, several were high end Vectra work stations), around 4 pallets of early 2000's beige fax machines and printers, a pallet of (failed, we tested a few) UPS's, and 4 totes full of obsolete PS2 keyboards, and several totes full of things so obsolete I had to google what they were. 

It was my duty to find a place that would take these (CRTs included) at no cost. I come to find out later while breaking into the computer of one of my predecessors that I wasn't the first person to get this job as there were pictures of when these machines were first put on pallets dated 2011 and pictures of several machines turned on. It was also my job to strip the RAM out of them. I kid you not most of the GX50s and GX60s (pentium III based Celerons) had been upgraded to 2GB using 2GB SDRAM modules. I didn't even know they made SDRAM into that capacity. I also had to pull the hard drives. I eventually found a manifest that explained these modifications: They had been using these machines (along with Windows XP and 2000) up until 2014.

Yes, thats right. Pentium III Celerons were in use with this company for over 15 years straight. This along with the fact i was supposed to somehow make CRTs vanish into thin air without paying a recycling fee (around here most places charge 5 dollars a monitor) were my first indications that we basically had no IT budget. What's worse is that all this garbage was stored on the second floor which meant we had to move it all down to the loading bay (where my boss also had constructed a partial home, and stored vintage cars..... we weren't well managed). Some of these machines were so full of dust and ruptured capacitors I nearly got sick working on them.

Oh yes, and I was expected to do all this for $10 an hour, and have it done by March (we started mid January), somehow without incuring overtime. This was in addition to doing constant live remote tech support for 45 locations and readying machines to be deployed and applying mandatory updates after hours (which had to be done manually for the main PC at each office, after hours because it knocks everything offline).

It was almost like they had never thought that eventually this stuff would pile up and by that time they would be so obsolete you can't GIVE them away (this is in IL, we have some of the strictest eWaste disposal laws in America. So anything like CRTs and printers can cost 5-50 per unit to dispose of). I told them that there timeline was unreasonable and in order to get rid of this stuff at no cost to the company it would take me months and that getting rid of it right away we were looking at 2 grand (which is a tiny expense given the size of the company) and the boss looked at me like I was insane.

Last I heard they found a place in a major urban center that would take them for free because of the AMD and intel machines being new enough to be resold. We only had two people working IT (for 150 employees) and my position was eliminated because apparently 2 people would be an unneccesary expense. They kept the guy with 20+ years on me and a degree. That didn't even make sense because while he had more OS and Networking skills I could run circles around him with anything hardware related such as oh I don't know, preparing machines for disposal (in two days I stripped something like 100 computers, in two days the other guy stripped 30 or so).

We do not support the code; we are not developers. If you code your own and it borks, YOU troubleshoot it.  
  
Lady was having issues getting her thing to work. She said a programmer had previously gotten it to work, but couldn't give me any information on how, or workflow, or anything. Then she threw this gem at me:  
  
""Well my programmer was able to do it, so it must be easy.""  
  
I'm not even a programmer and I seethed for the rest of the day. I was very relieved when she got tired of me and ended the chat.",talesfromtechsupport,2191,1520117147
Twpak,You have to join my guild,"Been conflicted about sharing this one. Not sure if it fits this sub. But I really have to share this one. Happened a couple of months ago.

We provide on site tech support for home and corporate users (75% home users). They call us after watching our ads on late night tv. 

Got ticket where a user was not getting display. Ticket also mentions that she thinks it is the GPU drivers causing the issue.

I get to users and the house is filled with moving boxes. Only the computer table and the PC have been put in place. It is very messy, navigating is impossible with the bed frame, sofas and boxes blocking entrances to doors.

&gt;User: Really sorry about the mess. I have moved here today and the movers have just dropped all my stuff. I really need to get my computer working as I need to play my game.

&gt;Me: No worries. Lets have a look at the problem.

I turn the PC on and sure enough no display. I didn't even see the POST screen so I have a look if the monitor is plugged in. The monitor is into the mobo instead of the GPU. Connect it to the GPU and got display but the was getting the no boot devices found. I open the case and seems the SSD had dislodged from the tool free enclosure and a sata cable had come loose. Install SSD back and connect the SSD. Restart PC and everything seems to be running ok. I note that the GPU is a branded 1080ti, wonder what she plays.

&gt;Me: Seems that is what the problem was. HDMI connected to the wrong port and the SSD being disconnected.

&gt;User: That simple. I know nothing about computers. My husband built this custom PC himself.

I am thinking if the husband is capable if building a high end custom PC then why is she calling us?

&gt;Me: How come your husband didn't connect everything properly.

&gt;User: He's an a#@hole. He is divorcing me. But I took all his stuff (after a 5 second gap) and the house, which I am trying to sell. It is on the market now. This is why I moved here.

Looking at the screen. See steam installed and shortcuts to all AAA titles on the desktop. Try changing topics.

&gt;Me: Lots of games here. Which one's do you mainly play.

&gt;User: None of these, my husband used to play them. I play Empire: Four Kingdoms (I wouldn't have remembered it if she hadn't repeated it 100 times in the hour I was there). I am the guild leader there, everybody relies on me to get stuff done. I really have to be online asap.

Thinking this is an mmorpg. 

&gt;Me: Awesome, I used to play a lot of WoW. Fun times

&gt;User: You gotta join us. It is an amazing game.

I have been at her place for maybe 10 mins now. Since we charge in 1 hour blocks we 'HAVE' to ask if there is something else we can help with if we solve the problem before the 1 hour is up. When they call to book a service the script tells them ""After the tech solves your issue he can have a look at your PC and answer and tech questions you may have"". We cant leave even when the problem is solved if the user has questions.

&gt;Me: I would have loved to if I had the time, unfortunately I don't get time anymore. If there is anything else you need help with please let me know otherwise I have to get going.

&gt;User: Since I am paying for the full hour I have to think if I need help with something. Lemme show you my game.

She launches a browser game (I think, dont remember if it had a launcher or not).

&gt;Me: Don't you have to pay to win these games?

&gt;User: Nah the game is completely. We do have to buy the gems. I only buy them because I am the guild leader. Everybody else in the guild is like 14 years old and they don't have any money. In order for the guild to be competitive I give my members gems.

&gt;Me: Oh, how much do you spend typically?

&gt;User: Not a lot. But you cant put a price on this. I get so much enjoyment out of this. I'll give you gems if you join my guild.

&gt;Me: I wish I had the time. But really how much do you spend every month?

&gt;User: (ignores question). Here is my village. This is blah blah blah

&gt;Me: How much do you play everyday.

&gt;User: Some times I don't even sleep for days. As a guild leader I have to manage everything.

I need to know more. I am confused. It looks like the typical waiting game, you click something and it takes x amount of hours to complete. 

&gt;Me: How come? What do you do when you are playing it?

&gt;User: Mainly diplomacy and recruiting. I have to message other guild members to form alliances. Planning attacks and stuff. But most of the time is spent on convincing new players to join my guild. When a new player joins the game their village is put somewhere randomly on the map. The first relocation is free. I have to convince new players to join my guild and relocate near my village. So that every guild member is close. 

&gt;Me: Interesting

&gt;User: You see. I joined the game late and I am a very competitive person. I need to have the strongest/biggest guild in the game. At the moment I am messaging every new player that joins the game. 

&gt;Me: So thats why it takes so much of your time?

&gt;User: Exactly. If you join I will make you a co-leader. I love my guild members. I also organize meetups with other members. It is an awesome community. Sometimes I fly to other cities to meet other members.

&gt;Me: Like cities where multiple of your members are?

&gt;User: No, single users. That is how much I love my members. I fly out to meet every single one if they are open to meeting me.

&gt;Me: Amazing

&gt;User: Well if you even want to join these are my details (jots down stuff on a paper and hands it to me). I guess we are done. Thank you for helping me, there is nothing I need help with. I need to play my game now. Have a good day.

&gt;Me: Good day to you too.

nearlearl,Want to stay for dinner?,"I work for a local IT company and I do service calls for residential customers. On this particular day, I got called to troubleshoot poor wireless performance onsite.

Me: Guy dude that does work

Customer: Uses internet to Google recipes and ask Alexa questions. 

Boss: bossman

The work performed was pretty simple. Router in place was old G or N class linksys that I spent 5 minutes with before telling the customer it should be replaced. Got new wireless network up and running in the home, and reconnected the wireless printer. This was my last ticket for the day so I was done around 5:45PM. I told the customer she was all set and gave her the run down of what I did. As I'm packing my equipment:

C: Are you hungry? Want to stay for dinner? My husband is coming home any minute and you can join us.

I remember being really hungry that day, I think I missed out on lunch. The spaghetti and meatballs she was making was too good of a deal to miss out on.

Me: Yes please and thank-you

I was offered a coke, her husband came home, we sat around their table and enjoyed a meal. Talked about work, school, life, and the busy week ahead. Gave my thanks and went back to the office. Internal notes on the ticket read:

""30 minutes of time was spent eating dinner with client.""

Bossman was happy, customer was happy, and I was full.

tl;dr

Went to troubleshoot wireless issue, ended up working on relationship with client using spaghetti.

Delodien,"""Computers"" and ""Monitors"" are not the same thing...","This little story happened this week, it involved myself and a relatively new user who is still in her teens, that bit is relevant as I maybe foolishly, thought someone younger would understand the differences between hardware that makes up a workstation.

U - the user. D - Me!

&gt;U: Hey D, so there is a computer in the room near me that no one uses, can it be moved to another room so I can use it for some other tasks.

&gt;D: Sure, no problem, I'll pop down to the room and move things around.

I walk down to the room, smallish room with a desk, on said desk was a monitor, keyboard and mouse with the cables dangling down. I look under the desk, no computer tower, so I get a bit confused and go chat with the user.

&gt;D: So I've been in that room, there is only a monitor, keyboard and mouse, not computer tower, I can get one sorted but I'll need to get it from the other office.

&gt;U: No no, there is definitely a computer in there.

&gt;D: When did you last check? People have a habit of moving things without telling me (true story)

&gt;U: About 30 minutes ago?

&gt;D: Er, right OK. Where was the computer? Because it's not under the desk where they normally are.

&gt;U: No, it was sat on the desk.

Commence confused face, it's been a busy week, but I wasn't that tired that I missed a full computer tower on the desk.

&gt;D: Right...OK, come with me, show me the computer.

The user lets out a sigh in the typical ""I don't have time for this"" and we head to the room.

&gt;U: See, its there, on the desk next to the mouse and keyboard.

She points at the flat panel monitor.

&gt;D: Erm...

My brain goes into meltdown, how the hell do I respond to something like that, this person quite firmly believes a computer monitor is the only part of a fully functioning workstation - before I'm accused this was a very flat monitor, very obviously not an AIO workstation either.

&gt;D: Right...that's the computer monitor. That needs to go into the computer tower, they sit under everyone's desks, the big black boxes you turn on in a morning.

&gt;U: ...No, that's the computer, you just need to move that *points at monitor*

I've been in the job about 10 years. I know what a monitor looks like, at this point I'm losing the will to live, and as she's fairly new I go with this.

&gt;D: Right...come with me.

I take her next door to an empty office but with 3 fully setup workstations and sit her down.

&gt;D: Right, what's this *points at the flat panel monitor*

&gt;U: The computer.

&gt;D: Right...and what's this? *points at the tower on the floor*

&gt;U: Erm...

&gt;D: Right, let me give you a little lesson. This *points at the monitor* is called the monitor, it can be called a display, panel, screen, a lot of different things.

&gt;U: Ok...

&gt;D: This, *points at the computer tower* is called the computer tower, or computer for short, it can be called many different things, desktop, PC and a lot of others, generally computer will suffice. OK?

&gt;U: Yeah...I understand.

At this point she had gone the brightest shade of red. I wasn't aiming to embarrass her, I was genuinely teaching her the components of a workstation, I wasn't using any sort of condescending tones. 

&gt;D: I'm not trying to embarrass you or anything, or make fun of you. Just feel it's better you understand the differences.

&gt;U: I know...I just feel stupid now. Sorry for wasting your time!

&gt;D: Don't be sorry, I've dealt with stranger things and stranger requests! (not sure if that's true...) I'd rather I taught you it now, if you've never been shown the basics!

&gt;U: Thank you, I appreciate that. So, when you get a COMPUTER from the other office, can you move the MONITOR and other things with it to the other room.

&gt;D: Yep that's absolutely fine!

She walks back to her actual desk, still as red as a tomato. I chuckled to myself and carried on with my day. What shocked me was her age and that when she started about 2 months ago she didn't question anything with the computer and how to use it, so she's used one before in the past, and in her late teens it's hard not to have done..really. 

TL;DR Had to educate a user who genuinely thought a monitor was the main component of a workstation. We finished as friends and joke about it now.",talesfromtechsupport,829,1519999405

Once i arrived he was still te only one at the store (it was ~30 min before opening) and when i was talking to him about the error, a salesperson came in, grabbed a coffee, went to the POS system en flipped the powerswitch on the back of the monitor. and behold: image!

Galixander,We have a VM that has been shutting down nightly for 2 weeks and the user of that VM calling every morning,"We have one user who accesses her very own virtual machine. We aren't exactly sure why, but that's the case. Anyway, starting a couple of weeks ago she called us at 8am on the dot, which is when we arrive to our office.  
&gt; **Her:** Hey, I'm trying to get into my virtual and it says it can't connect. Can you take a look at it?  

&gt; **Me:** Yeah let me just look on my side real quick.  

I check inside vSphere and sure enough, the VM is off. That's weird. Although I know the night before I had pushed some updates to her virtual, maybe that's it. In any case, I start her VM and let her know and she thanks me and that's it.  

Fast forward to the next day, 8am on the dot.  

&gt; **Her:** Hey it looks like I can't get into my virtual again, can you check it out?  

&gt; **Me:** Yeah let me take a look again.  

Sure enough, again, it's off. So again I turn it back on and she gets in without any issues. This goes on for the past couple of weeks because with everything else going on I just haven't had time to troubleshoot the issue. At this point I am just assuming something with Windows Updates.  

Finally I get a chance to look at it. I check Windows Updates, nothing pending an install. So I check out the power settings; everything is normal there. Next, logs. I can see the virtual is shutting down and when but it doesn't give any sort of error message. In fact, it looks like a completely normal shutdown.  

Now at this point and after doing some master Google work, I can find nothing so I took to /r/techsupport. There, someone told me I should see exactly *how* she was ""logging off"" at night. Okay? But she has been using this virtual for a few years now with no issue. So I contact her.

&gt;**Me:** Hey, I was just wondering something. At night, do you log off and if so, how do you do it?  

&gt; **Her:** I think I have done both disconnect and shut down.  

At this point I let her know that shutting down, shuts it off while disconnecting will leave it on. To which I get the simpl reply of  

&gt;**Her:** Makes sense. I will only disconnect.

Just happened 10 minutes ago.

Had a ticket that the user submitted through the intranet system that literally only said ""WiFi Adapter"", gave her computer name, and nothing else. No idea how it got accepted for having so little information.

Messaged her through Lync asking how I could help and if she could clarify what she meant. Apparently she had tried connecting from home and couldn't see her WiFi network, so she came into the office.

&gt;Me: ""okay, can I remote in to take a look at the WiFi adapter when you have availability?""

&gt;Her: ""how is that going to help as I don't use the WiFi here?""

&gt;Me: ""I can check your WiFi adapter to see if it can detect networks and see if it needs the driver reinstalled"" (been seeing this lately after a round of updates, some users are getting their WiFi card drivers corrupted. Easy fix luckily)

&gt;Her: ""are you not in the office? Why remote in if you can just walk over?""

Oh boy. One, she's on the other side of the office, so it's a long walk. Two, Bomgar lets you connect quickly and allows quick access to various tools. Three, talking in person means no chat logs to log in the ticket. She's the kind of user where you need chat logs else she *will* lie about you.

I told her how Bomgar is instant and allows tools to be acessed quickly.

&gt;Her: ""that's not good customer service, most people would rather have you in person, remoting in is cold, communication is a huge issue in this company and IM is part of the issue [etc, etc]"" 

(WTF? IM logs everything, lets you reference the chats at any time, allows links and files, etc, IM software like Lync *helps* communication...)

Clearly there was no way around it, so I grabbed my handy dandy notebook in case I needed to jot down what I found and headed over.

She explained everything she already explained, I sat down...

...and instantly found the WiFi adapter had no issues. Everything was enabled, it could see the networks around us, no errors, nothing.

So, I confirmed that it could connect to the local WiFi and everything worked. 

I told her what I had found and explained that there was nothing wrong with the laptop.

She laughed at me.

She completely refused to listen to what I was showing her. I told her she would need to check her home router/modem and possibly power cycle them.

She would just keep chuckling and would say straight to my face that I was wrong and didn't know what I was talking about (let's ignore my years of experience I guess?) and that the problem was the laptop.

So, okay, I explained maybe it's a corrupt WiFi profile, so I showed her how I removed the WiFi networks and how she would need to add hers back if she can see the network when she got home. If she still can't see it, it has to be the home network.

She just laughed at me and said she knows it's the laptop and I'm wrong because her husband works in IT.

She was still chuckling as I left.

I emailed my manager to cut ahead of her in case she contacted him, and the helpdesk manager to warn helpdesk of an unprofessional user that may call in later and what I have already done.",talesfromtechsupport,2572,1519921382

Today we are hosting an event where parents come in to listen to speakers about various topics. Some of those speakers are members of our faculty/staff. 

As I am enjoying a quiet morning browsing Reddit, a member of our IT department who has been doing this longer than I have, and whom works on a different campus, runs into my office in a huff:

&gt;Her: The projector in the room I am presenting in is stuck on the video input and there is no remote in the room to change the input!!!!!!

&gt;Me: The remotes are not paired, you can use a remote from a different room to change the input.

I go back to my screen. About three minutes later she returns, red faced and full of rage:

&gt;Her: ITS NOT WORKING! YOU NEED TO COME HELP ME!!!!

&gt;ME: *sigh* Ok, let's go take a look.

We walk down to the classroom I check the A/V box, everything looks secure and inserted properly. Then I look up at the projector, and discover the issue........Somehow or another the HDMI cable has been unplugged from the Projector. 

I get up on a chair, and plug the cable back into the projector. Wouldn't you know, the image immediately pops up on the screen.

Now, I wouldn't necessarily expect a normal teacher to catch this, but this woman has been doing IT for longer than I have and she is in charge of teaching the teachers how to effectively use technology in the classroom.

Today my mother restored my faith in the end user.

I knew that she would have a process to finish her work if I could just get the mouse working. 

* She had tried unplugging ""the USB bit"" and plugging it back in. 
* She didn't have any spare batteries (she had already checked)

She was in the middle of her last bit of work and just needed to finish it up, so I decided to teach her how to use mouse keys.

She had difficulty figuring out how to ""click the yes button"" without a mouse but described the things I asked (is there a gray dotted line around the yes button) and we managed to turn Mouse keys on.

She already had a piece of paper and a pen (to write down what keys were click, double click and click and drag)


She had some difficulty with terminology (cursor vs mouse) but through the entire process she was (mostly) calm, listened to what I was saying, asked clarifying questions and never lied to me once.

I do some basic troubleshooting, no joy. I know there are a couple of spare monitors there and I know he's not going to swap one out himself, so I head straight over.

I get there and both monitors are fine - bright, clear, not jittery, etc. I figure the monitor was turned off or something similar and that he or his assistant fixed it themselves. He's in a meeting with one of his clients so I leave him a note saying everything appears to be fine now and I go back to my office. As soon as I get back my phone rings, it's the client, he's irritated because the monitor is still blank and I was there but didn't fix anything. Hmmm...

I go back to his office (luckily they're only a few minutes away), he's sitting there in front of two perfectly fine monitors. I ask him what' going on, he points to one of the monitors and asks me if I'm blind since it's obviously too dim to use.

It's at this point I realize he's wearing sunglasses. Polarized sunglasses. Because he got an eye exam first thing this morning and they dilated his eyes. He didn't like the disposable glasses they gave him so he's wearing his own.

Turns out that even though the monitors are identical Dell P2314H units that they're polarized in different directions. We share a good laugh, he tells me not to change anything because his eyes will be undilated in a couple of hours and I leave.

What's even weirder is that as I'm driving back I realize I have two of the same model monitors on my desk. I bring my sunglasses in and sure enough, one of the monitors is fine and one can barely be seen through the shades.

If we cant fix it then there is no charge (no call out fee's). We (the tech's) get paid even if we cant fix something. But that is bad business, we have to fix all their problems to make a profit.

Supervisor wants to send me to another tech's unfinished job. A customer can't locate some folders.

Read the description from the other tech. Her PC died after a power surge, she just wanted him to transfer her files to her laptop. Tech takes HDD out, copies the whole user profile from her PC running Win 10 and paste's it on her Laptop's desktop. Shows her where everything is and leaves.

A while later she calls us and complains that everything is not there. Some folders are still missing. Since the other tech is busy I have to head out.

Get there and plug their old HDD back with a disk tool to their laptop. Their whole user profile is there. Everything has been copied, nothing is missing.

&gt;Me: Do you know the location of the missing folders? Where they on the desktop? in my documents? where were they?
&gt;Her: I don't know.
&gt;Me: Do you know any of the names of the missing folders?
&gt;Her: Of course.

Tells me some folder names. I run windows search for those terms. Nothing found. I decide the folders must have been not on her user profile. I am frantically opening random folders on her drive. Nothing. She is sitting next to me, face 1 foot away from the screen. Every 30 seconds she goes ""there it is"" followed by ""not its not that"". She is also repeating that the folders are really important and contains her drawings and photos.

Call old tech asking if he had deleted anything. I know he wouldn't have deleted anything but I am out of ideas. He says he hasn't deleted anything. Thinking if perhaps maybe the drive was damaged by the power surge, but it is in perfect health according to SMART. After an hour of searching I give up.

&gt;Me: I am sorry but the folders are just not here. Everything on your old PC has already been copied to the laptop. If it was there then it should be here.
&gt;She: My folders are still missing. Where would they go? I need them back.

I ask myself if she even knows what a folder is. Is it something else she is looking for. It can't be a folder she is missing, everything is here. It is plausible she does not know what a folder is.

&gt;Me: Do you know how to create folders? The missing folders, Who created them?
&gt;Her: Of course I know, I created them.
Me: Show me by creating a folder.

I stand back. She takes the mouse, OPENS OUTLOOK, RIGHT CLICKS HER INBOX AND CREATES A PERSONAL FOLDER

&gt;Her: See

I couldn't respond. All I did was stare at her. Definitely took a minute or two before I composed myself and snapped out of the shock.

He said that he checked the receiver and it did not look damaged. He then followed up by checking the drivers in the computer to make sure that they were up  to date. Then he opened and checked the mouse:

&gt;Him: Your mouse is not working because there is a small plastic piece blocking the battery from the connector. You need to take it out so that the battery is then able to supply power to the mouse.

&gt;Person: Oh, I left it in there on purpose.

&gt;Person: I thought that part is used to ventilate the mouse.

Him said that to date, that is the worst tech support he has ever given to anyone.

$Me:  *Thinking - Oh dear, we've entered the Pointy Haired Boss Zone.*

$Me: *Out Loud Voice* - Let's meet and discuss requirements.  I'll be right up.


Our product had multiple versions, in 9 or so languages.  A typical installation (hw+sw) cost about the same as a new car for each user.    The installation media (4-5 CDs per version &amp; language) alone was several thousand dollars, but a common salesman's trick was to throw in several copies for free.

The typical user's connection was either 2400 or 9600 kbit/s; a business' connection might be a 1.54 mbit/s T-1.  Downloading it at T-1 speed was 12 hours, using all the recipients' bandwidth, and more importantly **all of ours**.  Or, you could dialup and take 75 days.

I drag my boss into $VPF's office, and have him ELIF.  Seriously, he is a very sharp individual, but in areas completely removed from my experience.

To end a too long story shortly:

We are about to make a sale in $SpaghettiCountry, for multimillion $SpaghettiDollars.  If the product is delivered in physical form, it's considered importing a ""good"", and we owe outrageous sales taxes and import tariffs.  But there's a loophole - if the customer can download the software, it's a ""service"" and taxes are more reasonable.  Even better, the customer only needs the *ability* to download the software.  With that ability, we can ship them ""free"" *backup copies* of the installation media as a service!

The next day, the CD images for $SpaghettiSpeak are available on a protected corner of the website.  A few weeks later, a deal is signed.  The customer is given a login id/password, goes to the directory, and downloads the product Readme file.",talesfromtechsupport,1328,1519479590
BoundlessBear,"If something is important, don’t delete it 3 times.","Background: I work for my university’s IT department. One of my job duties is to check out equipment for rent. At this time a lot of Student teachers are recording themselves teaching so they can apply for their licenses. 

Today, a student teacher comes in with one of our cameras and asks if I can help her upload a video to a special student teacher video website. 

Student Teacher= ST
Student Teacher video website= website 

Me: “hello how can I help” 
ST: “ I need help uploading my video to the website ” 
Me: “ I can help with that. Let’s plug the camera in” 
ST: “ I uploaded the video to my computer and deleted it off the camera” 
Me: “ That works. Can you log into the website” 
*ST brings up the website and I plug the camera in and look for the video. It looked like the card was formatted* 
Me: “ok let’s upload the video from your computer. Where is it saved?” 
ST: “ well I deleted it of my computer too” 
Me: “hmmm, let’s check your trash bin “ 
ST: “ oh I emptied that” 

I just stood there for a few minutes with a blank face until my boss walked in with a cart of stuff.  

Me: “hey ‘Boss’ can you help this student? She deleted a video off her camera and computer and needs to upload it to the website. I’ll unload all that stuff for you-thanks bye!” 

The Student was there for 2 hours while my boss tried to restore the SD card from the camera but he was never able to recover the video. 

How the heck does someone delete something that important once, let alone 3 flipping times!

gomexz,The Angels are coming,"A long time ago at a help desk that has sense gone belly up.  One of the many things we provided support for was a shirt lived brand of computers.  To use the term generic is much too generous.  These computers were such junk.  A violent sneeze while in another room was enough to cause a complete system melt down.

After a while of taking calls it's easy to fall into the grind of zoning out and being a mindless drone of helping people set up printers and dial up or tuning out and muttering ""uh huh....yea....I know.....yea...I get it."" as users whine about slowness or how the wifi isn't as good as third friends Dell blah blah.  Or people bitching that Yahoo changed their layout and they want it changed back.

But one day I was in a good mood and a got a call from a man who's name I long forgot so let's call him joeyjoejoe

Joeyjoejoe called and by luck of the round robin call system landed on my phone.  This man had the kind of old guy voice that made you immediately like him.  Like feel compelled to want to hug him kind of soft cheerful grandpa voice a man only achieves by a life time of kindness and love.

This gentleman was clearly new to computers and had a list of things he needed help with.  His demeanor instantly disarmed my cynical view of customers and i decided come hell or high water me and this man we're going to knock every item off his list call time be damned

As I walked him through various updates and configs which requires several reboots, I turned the ticket into a sort of narrative.  I type everything we talked about.  I wrote about the dial up connection we set up, his child hood, being sent off to war and how it took a toll on him.  We talked about him meeting his wife and what it was like falling in love with her.  He talked and I wrote about what it was like for him to become a father for the first time and the love that filled his life.  About the first time he became a grand pa how again his life was over filled with love.  This man really enjoyed his family.  You could hear the uke in his voice as he bragged about his kids and grandkids kids and naturally you could hear the love as he spoke about his wife.   I wrote everything in his ticket.

Where it happened how it happened.  Typically our tickets were much more mundane 

Problem:. Needs help with dial up connection printer and driver etc etc

Action:. Installed set up blah blah

Resolution:. Cx is happy 

But not this time.  It was a biography of this man's life.

We talked about his first car.  And how he paid for it by working his ass off.  He came from very parents of very modestly means but they too overflowed with love.  He told me about the day his father passed away.  His father he loved so dearly had a rough but if health for a while as he slowly died in a hospital bed.  Joeyjoejoe's every spare moment was spent at his father's side.  Joeyjoejoe shared words with me at this point in the call I will never forget.  With obvious tears in his eyes and a Shakey voice he said to me "" my father reached for my hand, and gripped it tightly.  He gently pulled me closer and with a whisper now my father.....   ..... My father wasn't a religious man but....  but... he said  ... ....*snuffle* 'the angels are coming' with a very slight smile on his face.  It was then his grip slowly weakend and....and he was gone *deep sigh*"". We were both silent for a moment.  I could tell it was hard for him to make it through that part of his story.  A tear slipped down my cheek as I finished typing.   With a deep breath he moved on with his story.  Back to he and his wife plans for the weekend and how he was excited to get his computer going to better communicate with his beloved family.

We were on the call for just over two hours.  We wished each other well and good day and that was that.  I finished up the ticket saved and closed it.

2 weeks later or so a co-worker shouted over the cube to me and said ""hey I've got joeyjoejoe on the phone, he wants me to tell you hi also what is going one with this ticket man?"". 

I smirked, I told him to tell him hi for me and then gave the tech a quick rundown of the things we did.  I then told the tech he should copy and paste the ticket I to notepad and give it a read.

The tech took care of joeyjoejoe and took my advice to read the ticket.  The tech told me the ticket was so amazing and kinda heavy a bit.  We both shared a smile.

That was the last time I ever heard from my short time pal joeyjoejoe.  If he's still out there kicking around I hope he and his family are doing well.  I also hope he knows I think about him from time to time.",talesfromtechsupport,961,1519411786
AyukawaZero,Please don't try to help me!,"Singular IT admin for a small business of about 100 users.  Part of my job is replacing toner cartridges, which is a quick and usually easy process I don't mind doing.  Today however, my phone rings:

&gt; User -  ""I think my new toner cartridge is leaking, I've got a bunch of lines printing on my pages.  Can I get a new one?""

Okay, pretty uncommon for a new cartridge to be bad but not unheard of.  I figure I'll go get a new cartridge and head to her office to investigate.  While I'm rummaging through the toner cabinet, the user tracks me down and approaches me.  The toner cartridge is in her hands, and she's scrubbing the drum with a Kleenex like it owes her money.

&gt; User - ""I wanted to save you the trouble of replacing the cartridge, but toner keeps coming out of it when I try to clean it.""

Crying a little inside, I follow her back to her office and replace the now-leaking cartridge.  She prints a few copies of her document to clean off the rollers inside the printer, but complains that there's still a bunch of lines printing on the page.  I look at the printout, I look at her document on the screen.

The lines that caused her to murder a perfectly happy toner cartridge were on the original PDF in the first place.

InevitableHorror,"Yes, you do need a battery","Years ago, my grandfather obtained one of those classic “business/school” tier computers that were sold off after a local university updated all of their equipment. Being that my grandfather only plays solitaire and the occasional venture into facebook, this Vista machine was more than enough for his needs.

It operated just fine for several months until he left me a voicemail that stated, according to him, “it just didn’t”.
When I called him back I asked if he could provide a bit more information, the conversation went something like this:

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Me: So can tell me anything you noticed, anything weird?


&gt;Grandpa: Well, I already talked $Grandma, as well as $YourUncle, $YourCousin, and $FriendlyNeighbor,  when I had them over and they all said I was reading the wrong thing and didn’t know what I was talking about


&gt;Me: What do you mean?


&gt;Grandpa: I thought I noticed this…uh..message..thing…that said I needed a new battery, and everyone I asked said my computer doesn’t need batteries because it’s a desk one (trails off…) anyway, I still got things to click on but now the screens all dark.

&amp;nbsp;

I told him I would take a look. I knew it wasn’t something as simple as a turn it off and turn it on again or that it was unplugged, as my grandfather may be elderly, but he damn near managed to set up his new modem all on his own before, and he would have checked all of that before calling me. 

By the sounds of it, it seemed like this was a CMOS battery failure and windows lost its activation code.
I brought along a replacement I happened to have in a junk drawer.

Sure enough, the CMOS battery went bad, and after he shut it down, his PC lost his windows activation and the year and date was set to something like November of 1492.

With the case apart, I showed him how the battery was installed, and he had a bunch of questions about what stuff was and what it did. 

I explained his PC does have a small battery just like his watch that allows it to remember small information like windows knowing you didn’t steal it^1 (describing the activation code as basically a “receipt”), how to turn on correctly, and making sure it knows we aren’t still in the colonial period when you turn it off.

&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT**^1- *As people have pointed out in the comments, windows reports itself non genuine as it cannot verify certificates with the authentication servers if the internal time is way off. I am clarifying this as reading TFTS is  a great way to learn about tech and don't want to mislead anyone.*

&amp;nbsp;

More importantly, I let him know that he was right – he did need a battery. I don't think I've ever seen him smile so wide as he ran out of the room to tell my grandmother that he was right about the computer.

GreekNord,I guess Rule #1 is still: Users lie.,"I work night shift NOC for a decent sized company (about 1000 employees, including the few offshore we have left)  
Our offshore does our server patching and remediation stuff, which is where the issue is tonight.  
I get an IM (and an email at the same time) letting me know that one of our offshore guys can't remote into any servers.  
His application starts to open, then gives up, but doesn't give any errors or anything.  
OK, happens fairly often (especially with offshore for some reason), so I tell him to restart his machine.  
This fixes most of the small issues that people end up getting.  
He waits less than a minute before telling me: ""ok, I did that but it's not fixed.""  
Not really believing he restarted it, I ask him if he restarted his VM, or his actual local machine.  
He says he restarted his VM, so I tell him to reboot his local machine.  
He waits about 2 minutes before telling me that he did that too, but it's still not fixed.  
Both times, I see that he doesn't go offline or inactive in Lync, so I already know he's lying, and hasn't tried anything.  
He wants me to call out to the admin for this application.  
Not happening.  It's 1am, and it's only for one person who is lying to me. No way I'm waking somebody up for this.  
I check our logs, and see that he logged in at 11pm, and never logged off again, which confirms that he never once bothered doing anything I told him to do.  
I finally reboot his VM manually from my side, which makes him angry because ""I had lots of applications open.""  
Long story short, fixed his issue, and he was able to continue just fine for the rest of the night.  
&amp;nbsp;  
worth noting that he told me to ""do the needful"" a total of 6 times in this 1 hour exchange.  
Whole issue would have been resolved in a matter of minutes, but instead it took over an hour.

We dance around, trying a password reset, check his AD information, whether he somehow got accidentally termed.  Everything works on my side with a temporary.

He cannot spell his own name.  He swears up and down that Timothy is spelled T-I-M-M-O-T-H-Y.  I proceed to show him on my laptop his spelling in the system (with the company over a decade), his HR information, and finally ask him to look at his driver's license.

CondensedBemusement,Graphs? We don't need no stinking graphs!,"Many years ago I'd started just started at a former workplace and discovered that the company wasn't using any kind of helpdesk software ... they were doing everything based on a shared email address.

I grabbed an old server, threw linux on it, and installed OTRS (a free opensource helpdesk software). Pointed the email address to it, and away we went. 

Everyone was happy with it for many months. Until **the** meeting. Myself, my boss who was IT Manager and his boss whose title escapes me, but frankly was Head of Time Wasting.

I should note that this was a long time ago and OTRS had only primitive reporting functionality at that point.

My boss called me into his office where he and his boss are having a meeting. He asked me *""Can we get better graphs out of OTRS?""*

I replied *""No""* which was a slight fib ... someone had recently released an addon module that did pie charts and all that stuff. But it was REALLY buggy and I didn't have time to mess with it.

The Head of Time Wasting said *""Well what good is it then?""*

My response: *""The purpose of helpdesk software is (a) to make it easy for the users to tell us when something is wrong, (b) make it easy for us communicate with the user and (c) to document that communication and the fix of the issue. Giving you pretty graphs to wave around in management meetings is the least important thing a helpdesk software does. The software was free ... it's quite well understood that if you don't like the graphing capacity you just import the data into a spreadsheet and make your own graphs.""*

I was sent back to my duties. And I really DID say a, b, and c like that. :)

The company then spent many thousands on a helpdesk software which made REALLY great graphs, and was a pain in the backside for the users and the techs. Which I refused to take responsibility for (claiming to be too busy) so my boss got stuck with it.

Poor bugger ... he was fighting with it still when I left.

Edit - Rather than keep responding to everyone who presumes to judge my work ethic and style based on one short anecdote I'll pop this in here. My boss had been running a spreadsheet to convert the exported data into graphs for the best part of a year. The Head of Time Wasting's issue was that OTRS couldn't produce the graphs natively.

syberghost,Don't fire your senior system operator then,"This was very long ago, my first job back in IT after a long foray into other fields. I was Senior System Operator for an ISP, which means 100% technical lead for everything but the boss (we were the first two employees) didn't want to call me System Administrator for some reason (probably because he thought I'd bail on him with that on my resume').

There are many stories I can tell but today we're starting at the end; the week I was fired.

All the documentation was stored in a subdirectory in my home directory, with a symlink in the Samba share so everybody could read it. By this point I had two junior sysops I was supervising, as well as a couple of PC support folks (we also built PCs and supported small networks etc.) who were semi-trained to fill in for phone support for the ISP etc.

The reasons I was fired weren't special, the manager was a crook and I wouldn't play ball, ratted him out to customers etc. What matters is the fact of it; I got fired. While I was being fired, one of the junior sysops, I'll call him Bob, made a phone call and by the time I got home I had a job offer waiting on my answering machine. (Cellphones weren't universal back then.)

That very day, the manager logged in and saw the documentation in my home directory, and assumed I'd made a copy of it, so he deleted it all. This would of course become important later.

Two days later, somebody accidentally fired off an rm -rf in /home on the server that contained customer web pages. They'd wiped out about 1/3rd of the customers before they realized what was going on and stopped it.

I was home enjoying my brief vacation (new job had made me an offer and I hadn't accepted yet, was still making my own phone calls), when the ISP manager called me:

&gt; me: Hello?

&gt; manager: Hey, uh, this is Manager, I'm, uh, sorry to bother you, but, uh, how do we recover a backup?

&gt; me: You don't fire your senior system operator. *click*

Brief pause to laugh my ass off, then I log onto ICQ and hit up Bob.

&gt; me: Bob, you alone?

&gt; Bob: Yep.

&gt; me: WTF dude? Manager just called me.

&gt; Bob: Somebody wiped half the customer directories, and we can't figure out how to restore a backup.

&gt; me: Docs are on the Samba share, it's step by step.

&gt; Bob: The Samba share is empty. There's nothing there.

&gt; me: Dafuq? There's a whole pile of docs, marked read-only to the Samba user, there's no way to delete them without going into my home directory and doing it as root. Wait, look in my home dir.

&gt; Bob: Yeah, it's not there; but now that you say that, Manager said something about erasing a copy of the docs in your home dir.

&gt; me: LOL OH SHIT he wiped all your docs man. OK, here's how to be the hero. Do not tell anybody I gave you this, this is thanks for the call to New Employer. *instructions to restore the document that contains the backup restoration procedure*. That command will pull the backup docs back, then you can follow them to restore anything else you need. Wait an hour and then be the hero.

&gt; Bob: Will do, thanks man. Enjoy the new job.

Lord_TheJc,Hello IT? Your local server room is on fire.,"This is a story from many years ago.

I was in highschool at that time, and our school gave us the possibility to do 1-2 week apprenticeships during the year and/or summer vacation.

The dad of a friend/classmate worked as a technician for the city, and since the city was also the chief town of the district, he worked together with the admins of the entire district (which were also high-level local technicians). This allowed both me and my classmate to spend 2 fantastic weeks with him and with the admins.

The day of this story me and my classmate were in the control room along with the other 4 district admins.

The admins wanted us to be part of their typical day, so we spent some time with every one of them, we took part as silent guests into some meetings, and calls were put on speakerphone.

While we were at the 18th floor of this super cushy skyscraper, 99% of the offices were spread across the cities in different buildings, each one with its own little server room.

$Admin 1 to 4 are the admins (duh), $Lady is the person that called us, me and my classmate have basically been silent the whole time.

Phone rings.

&gt; $Admin1: $Admin1 here, we have students here today so please note you are on speakerphone.

&gt; $Lady: Yes hello, I'm calling from [Other building in another part of the city]. Your local server room is on fire.


3 seconds of silence. Then $Admin2-3-4 jumped from their chairs and went to their jackets.

Me and my classmate looked at each other, knowing that this was going to be a great day for an IT student. Probably less for an Admin.

&gt; $Admin1: I'm sorry, but did you say ""on fire?""

&gt; $Lady: Yes!

&gt; $Admin1: Fuck. $Lady are you safe? 

&gt; $Lady: Yes yes. I'm at the second floor of [Building], I can see the server room from here!


We will learn later that this particular server room was on the ground floor, and the access door was on the inside couryard, which was visible from many windows.

&gt; $Admin1: Perfect. $Lady do you see flames?

&gt; $Lady: No.


Another stop. The other admins, now with their jackets on, stopped going for the door and started looking suspiciously at the phone.

&gt; $Admin1: ...do you see smoke?

&gt; $Lady: No!


Me and my classmate looked again at each other, with a WTF look on our faces. Admin2-3-4 were taking off their jackets and going back to their chairs.

&gt; $Admin1: How do you know there is a fire? is there an alarm ringing or something? 

&gt; $Lady: No, I opened the window and I was overwhelmed by the smell of something burning! It must be your server room!

&gt; $Admin2: Temperature control of their server doesn't report anything strange. Tell her if she took her medicines.

&gt; $Admin1: I appreciate your proactivity, but from here we do not see anything strange.

&gt; $Lady: But it must be your server room!

&gt; $Admin2: I have the camera feed. No fire. I insist about the medicines.

&gt; $Admin1: A kind colleague just checked the local camera, we can guarantee there is no fire.

&gt; $Lady: But...

&gt; $Admin1: (annoyed) $Lady, we have no reason to suspect a fire. If you feel unsafe ask [Name of building boss] to check the server room in person or call the fire brigade. Thanks for your call.

Rathwood,FWD: I need you to stop my employee from working. Immediately.,"In keeping with my tendency to share these stories immediately when I'm reminded of them, I must confess that I posted this once already as a comment in /r/gaming without even thinking of you guys. Sorry about that.

What follows is a story that comes from my first few months at [medium-sized company]. I previously posted here to tell [a story about the time I poisoned a user] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5gujya/you_poisoned_my_keyboard/), and [another story about that time I stealthily upgraded users to Windows 7 by moonlight] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7yik78/windows_xp_and_old_pos_software_vs_my_boss/).

So anyway.

I was a tier 1 phone jockey and this was my first “adult job” after college, so you can imagine how surprised and nervous I was when one day I get an email with the subject line “FWD: DISABLE FACEBOOK NOW!!” 

It was written just like that- in all caps, two (or maybe three) exclamation points. Inside, there was a long message chain containing an extended rant from our marketing executive (MKT), sent to the CEO, replied to, forwarded to the CIO, replied to, forwarded to my manager, and then kicked down to me with no explanation.

My manager did this kind of thing a lot- rather than open a ticket in the ticketing system he insisted we use a certain way, or explain anything in his emails, he would simply forward us an email chain of a conversation he’d been having with some store or department manager, some executive, or some vender, and we’d have to read through all of it to figure out what he wanted. 

This email was one of those. And since it had come from people up the chain from him, I had to read through all of his pathetic groveling and deferential boot-licking to reach the part where he made his unqualified promises about what I’ll do in how much time. 

Eventually, I surmised the following:

-MKT is upset that his employees are spending work time on social media.

-He has decided that this is all IT’s fault.

-He wants social media ""disabled on ALL computers."" 

-He sent this complaint to the CEO, because it’s not good enough to contact IT and open a ticket to get something done, he has to try to get someone fired while he’s at it.

Okay, fine. We actually had Websense, so I wrote up a ticket, opened up the admin console in Websense, and added Facebook’s URL to the blacklist. Done and done. 

I reply-alled to the message chain and let the executives know that we’re good. Immediately I got hammered with replies from the CEO, my manager, and MKT (who had made the request). They all wanted to know why I disabled Facebook on *their* machines.

Exercising all the restraint I had, I apologized and explained that when they said “disable Facebook on ALL computers” I didn’t realize that they meant for there to be exceptions to the rule.

I grabbed one of our Tier-3 guys and he helped me set up MAC filtering in Websense. We made a group for the executives and managers to be excepted from the social media blackout, and then blocked twitter, instagram, and all the other common social media sites while we were at it.

Thinking the issue has now been properly dealt with, I updated the executives, who seem placated, updated the ticket, and then closed it.

15 minutes later, a red-faced young woman (SMM) appeared in the IT office. She’s from marketing and was upset because she couldn’t reach Facebook or Twitter. I gently explained that those had just been blocked at the request of her department’s exec.

SMM: “But you’re NOT supposed to block ME! I’m a social media manager! It’s MY JOB to be on FACEBOOK. NOW I CAN’T WORK!”

Me: “Oh. Hang on.”

I placed a quick speakerphone call to MKT and got his admin assistant (AA).

AA: “MKT’s office.”

Me: “Yeah, can I speak with MKT? It’s about the Facebook blackout he requested.”

AA: “Ooh yeah, he’s pretty upset about that.”

Of course.

Me: “Can I speak to him?”

After a minute, she got him on the line.

MKT: “Rathwood! Glad you finally got it right.”

Me: “Sir? SMM is in my office right now.”

MKT: “So? Tell her to get back to work.”

Me: “Sir, she can’t. She says it’s her job to run the company’s social media pages and she can’t work now because of the block. Do I have your permission to unblock her?”

MKT: “...”

Me: “...”

MKT: “You mean we’re paying someone to be on Facebook?”

Me: “...she works for your department, sir.”

MKT: “Unblock her for now, and tell her to come see me in my office.”

Me: ""Okay.""

Okay.

I turned to look at SMM, and she was already walking out.

ME: “Hey- are you alright?”

She turned back to me. 

SMM: “I’m fine. This is the third time this month that dinosaur has forgotten that I work here. I’m used to explaining my job to him.”",talesfromtechsupport,5595,1518998516
SpaceOctopus94,I don't understand her logic,"So one of my job responsibilities is to help students print. Black and white is 10 cents a page and color is 30 cents. I had spent the last 20 minutes walking this student through the process of getting on a computer, getting on to word and as I'm doing this I try to explain to her how printing works at my job. Of course she ignored me. 

She gets done with her paper and informs me she is ready to print. Again I try to explain to her how printing works. She tells me that 20 cents is too expensive so she wants to save her paper on her flash drive. Ok whatever. So I help her and then she tells me that she plans to drive around and find a place where she can print out for cheaper.

Internally I face palmed but I wished her luck and she went on her way. So like, I get that students sometimes don't like to pay for their prints but to waste gas to attempt to find a cheaper place is a new low. ",talesfromtechsupport,1022,1518934383
dave999dave,"If the oncall phone rings and doesn't wake me up, what happens?","20 years ago I was given my first on call device, a pager. Back then cell phones were way too expensive. Shortly after my on-call duties began I asked my boss this question:

&gt;Boss: Well, I think there are a few things you can do to prevent that. Before you go to bed turn the volume up as loud as it can get. You may also try something like putting the pager in a metal can. The vibration should make a decent racket.

funtimeswithaix,"""You did WHAT on the production system?!?!?!"" (Or how to burn six digits in six seconds).","**Background**

So I work at a large software company, on a very... *unique* product. This product connects to the different software systems you run. It can monitor them in numerous ways, it can document, approval flow, and distribute changes to these systems, etc... 

One of the things it also does is coordinate with the maker of the software. The product sends basic information automatically (can be disabled at customers discretion) like installed product versions, servernames/IPs, kernel/OS/DB info, etc... this allows us to proactively identify customers and contact them when we become aware of critical issues (example: Database corruption can happen if customer is Running Database A version B on OS C version D with parameter XYZ set to true). 

For other customers, they contract work from us in a variety of ways. We create an order for the work in the backend, which is synchronized to the customer's frontend, and they can see the date, the status, etc. - and when the final report is available (documentation of what we did / documentation produced about the environment, configuration, issues, etc.) we upload it in our backend and it is synchronized to the frontend. This is a good approach because it ensures the documentation is linked to in a central place where it won't get lost between IT team/leadership changes and it provides transparency. It's also good because the cost of each document produced (in effort) is usually measurable in thousands of dollars, if not tens of thousands of dollars, and the value of most of the documents is long lasting (architecture/technical diagrams and documentation can be invaluable when you have an issue or are looking to upgrade or change a business process, etc. and actually understand it).

**Enter the outsourcer**. 

The outsourcer is a firm you've heard of (think ""nobody got fired for buying..."" territory), and they actually don't have a reputation for being generally bad. Like many things in life, there are good ones and bad ones at the outsourcer. The outsourcer in charge of the relevant team has a manager provided by the outsourcer who only visits the actual customer office *one week a month*. This means that his four onshore guys (not nearly enough for the application the customer was running) get virtually no oversight, and they're also worked to the bone (four is not enough people for what the customer ran, but customer dictated the budget). This means that the four onshore guys regularly need to push more onto the dozen or so offshore guys, who have much less experience and oversight.

**The busy Wednesday**.

Three projects are starting, management is pushing for a move from onsite hosting to a partner hosted hardware for the servers in addition to that, there's an upgrade of an existing system underway, and a monitoring effort that I am working on, along with the partner's guys. This leaves one of the most junior offshore resources with full administration rights in the monitoring/management application. Junior goes to one screen on the application and sees a dropdown with a lot of options. He decides to try to be helpful and clean that up, so he deletes it. It even asked him if he was sure!

What junior somehow missed is that he deleted *X*, in an application called ""*X* Manager"". It is the central concept of how things are organized. Systems are put into it, the reports are in it, the different monitoring functionalities are hooked into it. Not only does the deletion of *X* remove all of those associations locally, it also is only supposed to be done when all the different systems within *X* are decommissioned. So this had the affect of sending a transmission back to the software company saying ""*hey, you don't have to worry about keeping all those reports anymore either*"".

The *good* news is that the monitoring of the applications from a technical perspective was not fully impacted. The *bad* news is that some other monitoring work was totally undone, and all of the documentation on how their environment worked and the key findings they paid for was destroyed irrevocably, as there was not a database backup that could be used (the one available was not recent enough for legal/audit to consider it acceptable from a SOX perspective). The documents themselves were flat files that could be saved to desktop, but that only did you good if you saved copies of the flat files in a reliable place instead of just clicking open.

**Epilogue**: 

Offshore shielded each other. They were all working off of a single login ID in the admin application, so there was no way to identify who did it. The customer was livid of course and went for a pound of flesh under the threat of a lawsuit. The outsourcer agreed to increase the training for all of their resources. They also agreed to add 3 more people (nearly doubling the size of the relevant onsite team) to reduce their workload, so they could reactively address issues better and actually have the chance to breathe and work on some things *before* they broke.  

The estimated loss exceeded $500K - while some of the documents were ""point at time"" (*ABC* is broken, fix it by doing *XYZ*), others documented the complex logic on how custom code worked so it could be updated/changed consistently, and this was lost. Other work in setting the monitoring application back up also had a cost (resources/time). Going forward, the customer saved every report on a sharepoint as a secondary source and a folder on a network share with daily backups as a third source.

**tl;dr**: Customer uses outsourcer, outsourcer gives rookie full admin rights on a key application, rookie deletes things in the application without knowing the impact, $500K+ of documentation lost irrevocably.",talesfromtechsupport,1539,1518799874
zanfar,Super Important Critical Issue! as long as it requires no effort on my part.,"**Backstory:** I'm the newbie network engineer learning the ins and outs of the network by feeding on small non-critical tickets. The company has a half-dozen groups whose products all require a different flavor of OS. Because of the disparate requirements, our (network) responsibility ends at the server hardware: the OS and anything it runs is **Not My Problem**. While on paper this seems very clear, in reality, the division of labor gets hazy somewhere around the NICs.

Names and dates have been changed to protect the innocent.

I get an email from my boss; it's a forward from one of the other group's devop with a note from my boss:

&gt; **$DevOp:** We do not have connectivity on eth1 of $RandomServer. The switchport is broken. Investigate and fix.

&gt; **$Boss:** See what you can figure out, if it's a VLAN or shutdown issue, go ahead and fix it.

Cool beans, this is the kind of stuff I've been chomping at the bit to do. The very first thing I do is look up $RandomServer in inventory, and make sure I'm seeing traffic from the redundant connection--the MAC appears to have failed-over, so all is good. I then start to dig around, but before I can get very far, I get a phone call:

&gt; **$devop:** [Ignoring my greeting] What's the status of $RandomServer?

&gt; **$me:** I verified that your traffic has failed over to the other interface, so you shouldn't be in any immediate danger. Other than that, I can see that the primary port isn't connecting, but I'm still investigating.

&gt; **$DevOp:** Well it needs to be fixed immediately.

&gt; **$me:** Okay. I can assure you this has my priority until we get it figured out. Is this causing any downtime that I'm not aware of?

&gt; **$DevOp:** Yes, we're stuck until we get that connection up; it needs to be fixed immediately.

&gt; **$me:** Wow, I wasn't aware you guys had anything that was single-homed. I'll rope in a colleague and see if we can't get this expedited. I'll keep you in the loop via email.

&gt; **$DevOp:** Whatever, just get it fixed.

So I grab my coworker who has a little more experience--and access--to the server side of things and we quickly rule out the network or the config. It looks like this is a bad DAC cable. Unfortunately, this server is in a data center four states away. In this situation, we can overnight parts and pay the datacenter techs to install it. This is a huge inconvenience for Reasons, and obviously a non-zero cost.

**But Wait, There's More!** $OtherEngineers' family lives in the same city, so he stops by and takes care of any non-critical maintenance 3-4 times a year on his way out to birthdays or Christmas. He is, in fact, heading out there in 10 days for $Event. After speaking to him, he's happy to interrupt his vacation with a site visit.

So after conferring with $Boss, I call $DevOp:

&gt; **$me:** Hey $devop, I just want to confirm that this is an emergency situation. We can get this fixed tomorrow, but it's gonna cost. However, if you can wait 10 days, $OtherEngineer will take care of it on his way to $Event. I can see your (one) MAC on the other interface, so as far as I can tell, this can wait a few days.

&gt; **$DevOp:** Yes! I told you we can't do anything with that port down. It needs to get fixed ASAP.

&gt; **$me:** Okay, I'll call your manager and get the approval.

So I call $DevOp's manager because I can't authorize that expense, and it will get billed to his department:

&gt; **$me:** Hey $DevOpMgr, looks like we found the problem, we'll need to overnight and remote-hands the fix. It won't be cheap, so I just need to verify that you're okay with that expense. If you want to go through with it, it can probably be back up before noon tomorrow.

*Note:* It is entirely **Not Our Fault** that they have any downtime. If they failed to make use of the redundant network connections we provide (in your choice of 5 flavors), that's on them. However, we like to be good neighbors so we're **On It**, so to speak.

&gt; **$DevOpMgr:** Noon! We're going to be down for more than 24 hours! This is unacceptable, you need to fix it faster.

&gt; **$me:** [Apology] [Explaination] [Laws of Physics] [Not Our Problem]. Like I said, I am sorry about the downtime, but this is absolutely the fastest we can fix it. We would be happy to work with you to prevent this in the future, but in the meantime, I need your authorization.

&gt; **$DevOpMgr:** Fine! Get it done.

&gt; **$me:** Thank you, I'll CC you on anything involving this issue, and try to keep you updated via email.

&gt; **$DevOpMgr:** *humph* [click]

In the next 15 minutes, I get my coworker with the AmEx to buy and ship the cable, send the recording of $DevOpMgr with the expense report to finance, and submit a smart-hands ticket to the NOC. I also send a status update to $DevOp, $DevOpMgr, and $Boss, while thanking $OtherEngineer for the offer, but we're not going to interrupt his vacation after all.

Cue the next morning. I'm tracking the shipment every 10 minutes, and in a rare stroke of luck, it arrives before 10 AM. I'm on the phone with remote hands shortly walking them through the replacement. By 11:00, I can see the port come back up on the switch, and the MAC flips back to the primary port. All should be well in Narnia.

Another status email goes to everyone informing them of the fix, that we no longer see the problem on our end, and let us know if there are further problems. I also follow-up via phone, but $DevOp is out today (huh?) and $DevOpMgr isn't answering his phone. I leave voicemails, update $Boss, and head up to the third floor because today HR thinks that free ice cream will make us forget about the lack of organization and competitive pay in the company.

I promptly forget about the issue completely.

----

A few days later, I'm reminded of the snafu when recapping the week's activities during our sometimes-weekly networks meeting. I suggest that maybe (maybe) we have just a little more input--or at least visibility--on how the network gets used. Failing to *use* a provided redundancy seems to be criminally negligent for a critical piece of infrastructure. $Boss agrees, and we hook up after the meeting to do some investigation. We discovered:

* $RandomServer was part of a hardware refresh--new hardware meant to take over from some servers who are about to be decommissioned
* Our group *is* responsible for providing that hardware in a working state--three months from now
* We have a visit scheduled to that data center in 6 weeks to install that hardware, but $OtherEngineer, on a visit home two weeks ago, staged the hardware we had ""in stock"" so we didn't have to worry about shipping them.
* $OtherEngineer, being a nice guy, told $DevOp that the servers were installed, but not verified if they wanted to get a head start on configuration

So, in short, I spent half a day along with several hours of my coworkers time chasing down an ""emergency issue"" on equipment that was not in production, was not promised in any working state, and had two scheduled maintenance windows before the go-live date.

Oh yeah, and the problem $DevOp had that he couldn't get working with only one interface? Bonding the two interfaces for redundancy.",talesfromtechsupport,871,1518761918
EffityJeffity,The time I nearly killed myself,"A few years ago, working desktop support, every desk had a riser module with network, phone and four plug sockets. These plugged into the wall, and acted as a 4 way split, so were fused with 13 Amp fuses.

One day, we get a call that phone (VOIP with PoE) is still working but PC has shut off, and won't go back on. Typically, this was the fuse in the riser. They weren't the best made pieces of kit, and used to blow occasionally.

So a colleague and I go to check. I draw the short straw, and crawl under the desks, tracing the power cable back to the wall. I switch it off at the plug (you can do that on UK plugs), and get back up to change the fuse.

I whip my Leatherman (other multitools are available) off my belt, and unscrew the fuse holder. Sure enough, the fuse has blown - properly blown, leaving shards of metal in the holder. So I dig the pliers of the Leatherman into the hole to fish out the broken fuse bits.

I remember a huge bang. Then I woke up lying on the floor.

Loads of people crowding round me, asking if I'm ok. I'm more concerned as to where my Leatherman's got to. That was a present from my wife, and I've worn it on my belt every day for 15 years. It was eventually found in the ceiling void, having punctured a hole in the polystyrene tile on its way up.

Turns out my cable tracing was erroneous. I'd turned off the plugs for another desk, but it was someone who was away that day, so no-one complained.

SnArL817,Conning Our Kevin Into The Hard Work,"So, purchasing needs us to gather a list of all of our RedHat hosts, the number of CPUs, and if they're virtual, the number of CPUs in the physical host.

We have hundreds of VMs, and about 50 bare metal servers. None of this crap is documented. When the boss man asks for volunteers, NOBODY steps up. People are looking at me. The network admin helpfully says, ""Well, this can be divided up.""

Selben,Missing Laptops,"**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

**$Selben** - Previous Tier 1 tech support now an IT contractor - a bit more into his career.

 

**$Soda** - Entrepreneur and IT Consultant, and in a way $Selben’s boss - Extremely knowledgeable IT guru. Previously worked with $Selben at $SmallerCompany until they decided to move on. Also had a never-ending supply of 48oz sodas constantly on his desk, in his car, literally everywhere!

 

 

**$ITLead** - IT lead from current company.

 

**$Whatif** - Administrative assistant, not the brightest, but a nice person.

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

$Selben and $Soda had gotten a two-month contract working on some IT projects at a company through an old contact of $Soda’s. $Soda was locked away slaving away as a code monkey. $Selben could still chat with him during breaks, but otherwise was mostly on his own. He spent his time working on whatever needed to be done—typically things the other techs did not want to do.

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

$Selben had accidentally finished all open projects, and the printers were (currently) behaving, so he had recently been shuffled off to work with the hardware technician. He started off his day boxing up newly configured equipment and shipping to different parts of the company. The whole facility was really big on recycling, so some of the boxes had old packaging labels on them from their previous use, like “monitor,” “printer,” or even “coffee,” but $Selben did try to cross out any confusing labels. After finishing the last shipment, $ITLead asked $Selben to remain in hardware for the rest of the day and work on repairs, as the hardware tech wasn't feeling well and had headed home. $Selben enjoyed hardware, so he was happy to do so.

 

Lunch time rolled around. $Selben was about to meet with $Soda for lunch, when he was stopped by a panicked $Whatif.

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

&gt; $Whatif: A user just called in. They said their laptop was stolen, again!

 

&gt; $Selben: Send me the details. I’ll take care of it immediately!

 

$Soda had rounded the corner in time to overhear the situation and offered to help as well. He was currently a code monkey, but no way would a single ticket get in the way of his lunch!

 

Returning to $Selben’s desk, they pulled up the user’s information. They had just gotten a new laptop shipped to them, and the tracking information showed as “Delivered.” $Selben started to follow the procedure for a lost delivery, when $Soda stopped him.

 

&gt; $Soda: Hold up. $Whatif said the laptop was stolen **again**.

 

$Selben looked up the previous requests from the user. Three laptops had been sent to the user recently, and all three had been “stolen.” The area wasn’t known for crime, so it was a bit strange.

 

&gt; $Soda: I see some of these boxes for shipping say chips and other stuff.

 

&gt; $Selben: Yeah. They like to recycle…I see.

 

$Selben put on his headset and called the location.

 

&gt; $User: Hello?

 

&gt; $Selben: Hi there, this is $Selben from IT. I heard you may have had some laptops go missing?

 

&gt; $User: Yep.

 

&gt; $Soda *whispers*: Ask if they got ANYTHING from IT recently.

 

&gt; $Selben: Have you gotten anything shipped from IT lately? Anything strange?

 

&gt; $User: No.

 

$Soda’s brow furrowed, and he started to ponder.

 

$Selben got an idea.

 

&gt; $Selben: Who normally receives packages… Maybe check with them?

 

&gt; $User: *Sigh* Fine, I’ll ask our office admin.

 

After a few minutes and some sudden shouting in the background, $User returned.

 

&gt; $User: Never mind! We found the laptops. Thanks, bye.

 

The user quickly hung up.

 

&amp;nbsp;

 

Apparently, the hardware tech had gotten a really good deal on some recycled boxes. They were heavy duty corrugated cardboard able to hold 80lbs. But they were meant for shipping frozen fish and the outside packaging matched. So, when the “Frozen Fish” had shown up at the user’s location (three separate times), rather than opening the boxes, the office admin took the boxes and shoved them into their stand-up freezer. Why she thought IT would send frozen fish is still unknown.

 

All the laptops still worked, once they warmed up after being removed from the freezer. A new shipping policy was implemented, and the hardware tech started covering up logos and descriptions on recycled boxes from that point forward.

theservman,I've put 3 CDs in the drive and I can't read or eject any of them!,"Ok everyone, hop into the wayback machine with me and join me in early 1997. I'd only been on the job for a couple of years and was teaching in a really crappy career college, as well as doing support for the staff (hey, why hire a sysadmin when we can just pull one out of the classroom whenever we need something done?).

On the day in question, I got called into one of the boss's office complaining that he's having a problem with his CDROM drive. He says he's inserted multiple CDs and he's been unable to read, or even eject any of them.

After explaining that, in my experience, there is no way to accidentally insert more than one CD into a drive, he's still insisting that it's what he's done.

Now, this was in that brief period when some manufacturers were making trayless CDROM drives, similar to what you see in cars, so there was no way to pry the tray open (there being no tray). I hit the eject button a few times - nothing. I straighten out a paperclip and insert it into the ""eject hole"" - nothing (no resistance either... feels like there's nothing in there, which would agree with what Windows had to say).

At this point I'm thinking I'm going to have to take the lid off this drive to get these discs. Out comes the screwdriver and I take the case off the computer. As the case comes off, a CD falls out. Three more are inside the case too.

Turns out, instead of putting the CDs into the slot, he was sliding them into the gap between the top of the CDROM and the empty 5 1/4"" bay above it. A little pointing, and judicious application of scotch tape, and the problem was resolved.

The best part is that I had brought the class with me for this job. You may be pulling me out of class, but I'm still going to teach your paying customers.

TL;DR: User puts CDs into the computer case, not the CDROM drive and gets schooled in front of my whole class (his customers).",talesfromtechsupport,670,1518534003
MajorLeeEvil,I'm calling to give you a courtesy call...,"This happened yesterday. You may have seen my previous post on here - this is the same guy!
To sum up quickly, we're in the process of updating everyone (when we get a chance) to Office 2016 from 13. But we have the one user (who we'll call **$inept**) who is still on Office 2007 because 'he doesn't like change'.
This user doesn't like 'change' that much that he is one of the remaining employees on Windows 7 and has their theme settings to 'Windows Classic'. Yes...

So my manager goes over as he's out the office to check on his monitor (we had the MD chase us about swapping out his monitor - but we thought we had already) and whilst he was over there he started the upgrade of Office as we explained to him that Office 2007 was now a security risk and needed to be updated. The upgrade was then passed onto me to just complete finish. I remote in to take a look at how far the installation has gone and update the MAK code etc. Once completed I give him a call just to let him know that everything is OK and walk through a few things with him...

&gt;$me: $inept, I understand that you don't like change and will find it a bit different but it's company policy that we make sure software is up to date and not providing a security risk. It is something that unfortunately we have had to do.

Twpak,Bring me your copy of my Data!!,"Visiting a client at her house. She brings me an external HDD which she tells me has her photos but nothing shows up. Plug the drive in and yep seems it has been formatted. 

Tell her I could recover her data but it would take time. Ask her to get me another drive where I can put her stuff. She gives me cash so I can buy one as she did not have one with her. No worries. Promise to bring her drive back with her data by Friday 5pm

Get home, run a data recovery software and it recovers everything. Seemed someone had just formatted the drive so recovery was easy. Its all photos, thousands of them. Categorized by year and month, e.g. 1978 had 12 folders Jan-Dec. Didn't pay much attention to them, saw the folder structure didn't see what it was. Recovered everything to the new drive I bought for her.

Get a call from my employer Friday 5pm asking why I hadn't returned her drive yet after promising a Friday morning delivery, she has been waiting all day and they have given her a 25% discount because of the stress I caused her. Try explaining in vain it was supposed to be a 5pm delivery.

Meanwhile she manages get my number from my employer and starts calling me every 20 mins asking me to deliver the drive. Tell her I cant and that I will be there 5pm.

Deliver drive 5pm. She is pale, shacking and keeps asking if I made a copy of her photos for myself. Tell her I didn't but she keeps repeating the question. She moves to threats that if I had copied her she would sue me and shit. Keep insisting I didn't copy her data. Hand her the drive and leave.

15 mins later get a call from the office telling me the customer is on the line and the drive I gave her is empty. They tell me the client is asking if I have an extra copy of her data with me that I can just go I copy into her computer? Tell them I dont have a copy and that the customer is lying. Am told she wouldn't lie. They tell me to go back there and show her where the data is if I had indeed copied it.

Go back to the house. She wouldn't let me in, asks me to leave her property. Call the office, they call the customer. Customer tells them she has had such a bad experience with me that she is never gonna let me or anyone from the company come near her house ever again.

Spend next few days trying to answer what I did to piss her off without any luck.",talesfromtechsupport,845,1518328480
InfusedBuckyBalls,"Uhh, I think this is above my paygrade","This is more of a serious story than a humorous story, but think it would be appreciated here. A little bit of my background first. I was in the military before the job in this story. In order to participate in one of the missions, I was briefed into a temporary clearance upgrade where my clearance level was upgraded to a few levels above my current level.  This story had more precision, and more secrecy than the military mission I partook in.

Now onto the story. This job was for a large DoD contractor. No security clearance required, but a full background check was required that still took an SF-86. We had a specific operation to complete, but it was not secret and was dictated by a treaty across several countries. Other countries had full access to systems, so nothing was classified. The company however had their fingers in many other projects outside my own. My team consisted of a half dozen helpdesk technicians and just as many system/network admins. I'll tell this story as it was provided to me. I left this job with no NDA and this story also happened long enough ago that I feel comfortable telling it.

$boss: IT Manager 

$corpsec: Corporate IT Security Manager

$sysadmin: A good friend of mine, at work and outside

$me: a desktop technician

**Day 1: A Random Monday**

&gt; $Boss (during a routine daily meeting) - Ok, we got a priority project from corporate. This is to take #1 priority and all other projects, including critical path, will take a backseat to this project

Ok, this is weird. For those not familiar with the term ""critical path"", these tasks are ones critical to project management. They are tracked by a lot of eyes and they can delay the main project overall. To put these on hold is unheard of.

&gt; $Boss - $sysadmins, ensure all network devices are configured to use NTP. Ensure our AD servers are configured to corporate NTP servers and are properly synchronizing.  $me, please check that all workstations are configured to NTP. Remediate any workstations not synced. Deadlines for these tasks are by the end of the week.

Ok, these are routine checks, why the hell do these take priority?!?

**Day 5: The following Friday**

Sysadmins and I have checked all systems and we're fully synced to corporate NTP servers

&gt; $Boss - ok, everybody take Monday off. We have a full workday on Saturday. Enjoy your long weekend.

&gt; $FullTeam - Uhh, wtf boss. We never work a weekend, what's going on? Nobody else on site has Monday off.

It should be mentioned that our site, while not under a union, is very strict on hours. Overtime is unheard of, so any extra hours need to be comped somewhere.

&gt; $Boss - Corporate project from $corpsec. We need all hands on deck and that's all I can talk about. Do not speak of this to anybody. Especially do not email each other. If you want to keep the rumor mill rolling, do it through text messaging. Nothing about this goes across our network.

**Day 6: Saturday night**

$sysadmin buddy and I are out drinking. He manages our security systems on-site so I'm hoping he has a little insight into what is going on

&gt; $me - Dude, do you have any idea what's going on here? This sounds serious.

&gt; $sysadmin - I'm in the dark just as much as you are. Only person on-site that knows what's going on is $boss and the VP who approved our time shift.

**Day 7: Second Monday**

Fuck it. It's monday. I'm not working. Got my first call at 8:30am. ""Hey, I know you guys have the day off, but could you help me real quick with...""  Turned off cell phone and started drinking by 9am. I got 14 hours of video games in. It was wonderful.

Week goes on as normal. Nothing was mentioned, and no new information came out

**Day 13: Saturday we're normally off**

&gt; $boss - ok guys, we have a strict schedule today. We have about 2 hours of work and you are all authorized to charge a full days pay. Listen in on this conference call by $corpsec for a timeline.

We all grab a coffee and sit around the phone. Keep in mind it's been two weeks. We've all been trying to figure out what's going on. We all had hypothesis, but nobody was even close to the truth.

&gt; $corpsec - Ok guys, without divulging too much information yet. Here's today's plan of events.  9:00am all sites will terminate all outside access via physical gap. All internet connections will be physically unplugged. Any modems, cell backup, everything will be unplugged at 9:00am SHARP. You may disconnect early if necessary, but no connection will be available after 9:00.

&gt; $corpsec - $sysadmins, you will expire ALL passwords on site. This includes admin accounts, service accounts, and user accounts.  Desktop teams, your supervisors have a list of all workstations to remove from the network

Ok. Sounds like we've been pwned. I thought just we were talking to $corpsec, but he referred to us by our teams and our supervisors. But all our data is available to anybody wishing to audit the treaty compliance. WTF is going on?!? 

&gt; $boss -  Pull these 10 workstations off the network. Under no circumstance will you allow them to be reconnected. No data recovery will be performed. All hard drives will be sent to corporate.

The NTP sync now makes sense. We're pulling everything off at the same time. And by all, I mean ALL sites. This is a global company. Fortune 500 level at the time. There had to be over a hundred sites pulling connectivity at the same time.

I walk out to my workstation that I've been told to pull. It's Saturday. The place is a ghost town. Except for one engineer who is sitting at his computer. The computer I'm supposed to take. The engineering system he worked on was saved to his local drive and not the network. He wanted to copy the data to the network before I took his machine. Of course in direct violation of my orders. He called $boss who stated this was approved by the VP and I walked out with his machine. His project data was never given back and he lost 3 weeks of work. He made sure to save all project files to the network in the future.

Rest of the day went as planned. We had several calls on people not able to login due to expired passwords, and several servers crashing and burning over the next week as the cached credentials expired and attempted to reconnect.

In the week following the fun day, details began to emerge. Our entire infrastructure was pwned. Not just our site. Corporate wide. A foreign entity (never stated, but we guessed chinese) had gained access to the corporate AD servers and all other sites were compromised via the AD trust. They targeted engineering workstations and downloaded all blueprints and system specs.

That was the day I began to take corporate security seriously. Corporate espionage is no joke.",talesfromtechsupport,1406,1518249902
Karadra,Why you should probably have a decent knowledge about voltage.,"So I have this job as an on-the-field IT technician. I go to people's homes and fix whatever their issue in IT may be. The contract for this job is laid out in a way that I can accept or decline jobs/missions as I please (I think the English word for this is a suborder agreement). So it's good to have this job on the side while I study. To become, in all irony. An electrician. 

The tale begins with this job I accepted: ""Customer has problems booting up computer, nothing appears on the screen when pressing the power button"". 

Hours later: 

I arrive at the customer's home. She explains to me what the problem is and shows me the computer. I take a quick glance at the computer and then press the power button. The button lits green but nothing appears on the screen. 
So I start fiddling around to try to see if there was a problem with cables connected to the PC. Seems fine, nothing out of the ordinary. So I turned the circuit breaker on and off. I then press the power button again. But this time it lits green and then after some second it turns off. Confused I press the button several times and the same results occur. After thinking if it's a software or hardware problem I come to the conclusion it must hardware. 

I open up the computer. Nothing out of the ordinary just a lot of dust. I got rid of the dust and looked at all the components. It looks fine, nothing has melted it doesn't look like something has actually overheated. 
I check the power supply unit and opened that up. Strange, nothing special there. No signs of it ever overheating. 
I put the computer back together. Turned it on same results as earlier. Lit green, shut down immediately. 
In desperation I try everything, fiddling with cables, turning it on and off etc. To sound professional and to not admit I didn't know wtf the problem could be I said what first came to mind to the customer: ""There is definitely a problem with the power supply unit and you may have to replace your existing one with a new one. But I'll do some more looking just to be a 100 % sure"". 
Then.. I found this red switch. It hade two numbers. 230 and 115. It was turned on 230. And since I was desperate and came later to realize what this switch actually was meant for. I turned it to 115 and turned on the circuit switch but thankfully the power cord was connected to a ""branch contact"" (The kind you put in an already existing power outlet in a wall so more electronics devices can get power). I turned on the circuit breaker and proceed to walk to the branch contact and turn that switch on. 
The moment I turned on the switch for the branch contact the PC short circuited and a loud fucking bang could be heard across the whole apartment. Well fuck, now there is DEFINITELY a problem with the power supply. 
The customer rushed to me. Thankfully nothing happened to me. 
You could feel the smell of burnt electronics from meters away. 
I said: ""Well, I think I was correct about the issue regarding your power supply unit. It seems that you have to buy a new one. I could come back and install the new one for you?"". She was happy that I found the ""problem"" and said she would call me during the week when she had bought a new one. 

On the way back home still thinking about what actually happened. Thinking that it must had something to do with the red switch. I Googled it and learned that the red switch controlled the voltage for the PSU. And since I live in Europe and not the USA. That was probably the most stupid thing I've ever done. In this part of Europe in our outlets that's mounted to the wall. The voltage output is mostly 230v. 

Several days later I came back to the customer and installed the PSU. When everything was put together the moment of truth was here.. I turned on the power button. And to my surprise the windows logo appeared on the screen. She thanked me and I went home. Still wondering what the fuck happened. 

I have never told anyone the actual reason for that PSU to explode until now.


TL;DR: I made someone's PSU explode and got paid for it.",talesfromtechsupport,1312,1518171431
iguru42,"No, you can't have flash on your iPhone.","So I'm sitting in my office when a frazzled nurse walks in:

Me:  Well, Hello how can I help you?

FN:  I'm trying to do an education seminar on my iPhone but it doesn't work.  I was told I need flash?

Me:  Ah, if they require flash, then it won't work on your iphone you'll have to do the seminar on a computer.

FN:  Well they told me I need flash and some other stuff too.

Me:  Right, well since the flash is a requirement, you won't be able to do it on the phone, you should be able to do it on any PC though.

FN:  Hold on, they said I could use the iPhone, but that I needed flash and these other things.  (she swipes around on the phone, I assume looking for an email, she can't find it)

Me:  Unfortunately because of the flash requirement, they are wrong about it working on the iPhone, Apple does not allow flash onto iPhones, so anything requiring it will not work.

FN:  What about the other things they said it needed?

Me:  They don't matter because, according to them flash is required, so it won't work on your iPhone.

FN:  Well, that just doesn't make any sense to me. (and she left)

The other part of this is that she was asking about something I do not support.  Yes, I support her iPhone, but I don't support random crap she wants to do with it.  Some random education portal thinks flash can run on iPhones?  Good luck with that.",talesfromtechsupport,647,1518118219
I_Have_A_Chode,"Another ""no im not here to do your job""","I read a post earlier from U/SnArL817 and started typing this up in a comment, and decided i wanted to go into my detail so here it is.

outside user now known as $OU is coming into company to present something. all our rooms have equipment built in to the room so all you do is plug the HDMI/VGA+3.5mm/Display port cable into your laptop and viola! you can present.

Get a ticket that person is coming in and they will need assistance with this. Person submitting ticket is SUPPOSED to know how to do this very basic step of plugging a cable in, because we trained everyone how to do. Whatever, ill help anyway.

$OU comes in

$OU ""i would have thought you guys would have laptops in the building""

$ME ""we do, they are only for employee use""

$OU ""yes but im doing a presentation for $randomemployee""

$Me ""yes, you are doing the presentation so you bring in your equipment...""

she drops it and gets out her laptop, and proceeds to attempt to pry it open, hinge side. Now this isnt some new slim form laptop that it is actually hard to tell because hinges arent seen. This is about a 5 year old dell, blue lid, with silver hinges, blatantly obvious. So i have to tell her to open it from the other side. I take it and plug it in to the system and wam bam thank you ma'am, its on the screen. That easy.

$OU ""what now?""

$ME ""you pull up your presentation""

she fails to login and asks me what the issue is. Now this is a domain computer for her companies network. My first thought when it tells me there are no domain servers to access is that damn, this woman was given a laptop that she has never logged into before, shes up the creek here, while quietly laughing and dying inside, laughing because i enjoy the failure on her end, dying because i will have to do more work to fix this shit that isn't my issue to begin with.

Luckily she just spelled her name wrong in the credentials, shes now in the machine.

$OU ""now what?

$ME ""bring up your presentation?""

$OU ""its a youtube video""

$ME ""ok, go to youtube and load it up and pause until the person gets here""

$OU ""what browser should i use?""

$ME ""doesn't matter to me, whatever your preference is""

$OU ""so chrome?""

$ME ""whatever your preference is""

$OU ""ok, my friend at work really likes fox fire so i always use fox fire""

I think to myself, If thats what you like, then why are you calling it by the wrong name, and why ask me if you should use chrome after the first time i tell you to use whatever you'd like to use!?&gt;!?!?

Firefox is now up

$OU ""oh i have to go get the link from my car i left it there""

$ME ""you can just search youtube with the video name""

$OU ""yea the links in my car ill go get it""

comes back with a piece of paper with it printed on it, and hands the paper to me

$ME ""ma'am this is all your show, you go to the link""

she types out the link and it doesn't work, surprise surprise!

$OU ""My copresenter gave me that, ill call her and see whats up""

$ME ""whats the name of the video, or whats it about in general? we can just look it up""

$OU ""ill call her""

at this point im tired of this, they had sent me the youtube link in the helpdesk ticket that the person who submitted the ticket originally had CCed them on. I was really just trying to avoid doing basic acts of using a computer for someone at this point, because it sets bad precedence, and because, common.... look at what we are doing at this point...  So i just pull the link up on my phone, go to the video and look at the name and type it in on the laptop.

She comes back in with her copresenter who has now arrived and its up.

$ME ""its up and ready to go""

$OU ""OK so what do i do when the person gets here""

$ME ""Click play, anywhere on the screen (i've fullscreened it now) or hit spacebar""

$OU ""ok thank you""

$ME ""no problem, your laptop is about to die, i'd plug it in immediately""

$OU ""how is it about to die?!""

$ME "" you didn't charge it before you came in? its been on this whole time in your bag? not sure, but plug it in. Have a good one!""

Glasofruix,Weight mismanagement,"Hey there, it's snowing and there are no clients calling so i can share a small story with you, my first.    

A bit of context. I work for a small support company. We do pretty much everything tech support related for professionnal clients (hospitals, lawyers, water treatement plants etc...). Troublesome printers? That's us. You want to overhaul your entire network? That's us too.    

We have one client who's specialized in truck weighting. They sell their ""all in one solution"" with all the bells and whistles, from preparing the ground to weighting software and equipement. They have a **very** creative way of thinking when it comes to the actual terminals. Each and every one is built with whatever they have on hand, cabled in serial with homemade connectors and there's at leas three different software solutions in the wild (that i know of).   
About a year ago their IT guy retired and they've decided to outsource the support to us. They still have some dude inhouse who's supposed to develop their software (with microsoft access) but when it comes to everything else computer related they dump it on us and bill their customers later.    

So, about two weeks ago i get a call from their boss (a guy who's quite good with his hands when it comes to building stuff but with the managerial skills of a 5 years old and the spirit of a snake oil salesman). I'll be $me, the boss will be $boss and his ""tech guy"" will be $techguy and the dev is $dev.    

Phone ringing:  
&gt;$me: you've reached tech support, how may i help you?  
&gt;$boss: Hey, this is boss from weighting company, one of my guys is going to install a terminal tommorrow and he's got some troubles setting it up and testing it, do you mind giving him a call and walk him through the setup?  
&gt;$me: Sure not at all *why the heck are you testing it the day before you're supposed to deliver it?*

&gt;$me: Let's take a look, can you give me access to the terminal so i can see if i can connect it from here?  
&gt;$techguy: Well, it's not connected to a network  
&gt;$techguy: see, we just connect the pc inside the terminal to this hub thingy and we connect the other pc to it directly  
&gt;$me: *Hub thingy? Switch. Duh, not going to work* Aaaaaalright, can you explain me what you are trying to do?  
&gt;$techguy: Sure. I just click on this icon here that says ""my pc"" and then network and a click on the second pc, but i can't see it here but it usually works i don't understand.  
&gt;$me: When you say ""it usually works"" is it connected to a network maybe?  
&gt;$techguy: Yeah, but this client doesn't need those two PCs connected to their network.    

Turns out, his software is just an access form running on the terminal and the db on another PC and he's trying to connect the two together via windows' network discovery feature, which would not work with just a switch and both pcs in DHCP. I headdesk and prepare for the worse. Curiously he managed to configure the static IPs just fine.

&gt;$me: *ah, the i'm looking in the middle of the screen and there's nothing around that part case then* Can you look on the top left par of the screen and tell me what you see?  
&gt;$techguy: Uh, ""quick access"" and a bunch of files

&gt;$me: *please kill me now* Not even ""file"", ""computer"" etc...?

schatzi_sugoi,When company policy does not make sense...,"Hey, everyone. I'm new here. I'm on mobile so please forgive me for formatting issue. I'm also the user in this situation but I also work in tech so I hope it fits.

A brief background, I'm a software consultant for a fairly well known IT services company.

Let's introduce our main players in the story:
$Me: Software consultant handling several accounts.

$Customer: My main client. We have a fairly good working relationship.

$TS1: Email support tech 1. Loves company policy.

$TS2: Email support tech 2. Actually knows what he's doing.

Now that's out of the way, let's begin.

I'm minding my own business, working on some development stuff. It's a weirdly light day. Not a lot of emails from my customers.

$Customer: Hey, schatzi_sugoi. Is everything okay?

$Me: Yeah. I'm working on the stuff you asked me to do. Why do you ask?

$Customer: Well, I have sent you a bunch of emails and the business users have too. But you haven't replied to any of them.

$Me: Huh... that's strange. I haven't received any.

I try refreshing my email client a few times and tried the web version. No new emails from them but new ones from within the org. I let customer know that they should email me on the customer-provided email address until I can sort this issue out.

I now raise ticket with email support.
$TS1: Hi, how may I help you?

$Me: Hi, I can't receive customer emails in my account.

Now at this point, I should tell you that we have two email domains because of recent changes in our company. Our mailbox is on our old domain but when we email clients, it is masked to look like we're sending from the new domain.

After some back and forth with TS1 about the details of the issue.

$TS1: Do you know what domain your customer cannot reach you at?

$Me: The new one.

$TS1: Upon checking, company policy states that we are not allowed to receive external mail on that domain.

$Me: That's not right. I was able to receive mails from customers this morning. Did company policy change in the last hour?

$TS1: No, that's company policy.

$Me: We're a consulting company. Our main form of communication with customers is via email. That cannot possibly be company policy.

$TS1: I don't know what to tell you. It's company policy. Can you share your screen so I can check the details of this issue?

$Me: You don't need to see my screen to understand the problem. I won't be able to demonstrate to you how my customer sends me an email and I don't receive it. If it's not allowed to send an email to that domain, shouldn't the customer receive an error message?

$TS1: Yes.

$Me: They didn't get one. That's why they thought I received the message but was not replying. Can you escalate this to a more senior resource?

$TS1: Please ask your client to email you on the old domain. 

$Me: But when I email them from the old domain, it's masked to look like it's coming from the new domain, right? So when they hit reply, they'll send it to the new domain. 

$TS1: It's company policy that we don't receive external mail on that address. Do you have any other issue?

$Me: No, this is my only issue and this is not resolved. Please escalate to a senior resource.

TS1 proceeds to close the ticket with a resolved status. Annoyed, I opened a new chat window.

$TS2: Hi, how may I help you?

$Me: Hi, I can't receive customer emails in my account. Your colleague told me we can't receive external emails on the new domain due to company policy. That doesn't seem right.

$TS2: There's an outage right now with the new domain. We are trying to get it fixed as soon as possible. In the meantime, I'll open a ticket for you so you can be updated once the issue has been resolved.

$Me: Ahh. Okay. Keep me updated then. Thanks!

I sent an email to TS1's manager and asked them to investigate this issue since they were giving me false information about company policy.

I haven't heard back from them but I plan on following up with them in a few days.

TL;DR: When company policy doesn't make sense, it could be because it was made up.",talesfromtechsupport,1240,1517937984
manipulated_dead,Fixing things the only way I know how,"I've been reading TFTS for a long time now, and about a year ago posted [my first tale](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5skfud/finally_got_to_use_this_classic_trick_in_front_of/) about fixing a problem beyond my comprehension in a stupidly simple way. Here's another quick one.

CONTEXT: I'm a teacher. For security purposes the staff carpark at my school has an automatic gate. To enter from the street, staff are issued with an RFID key. To leave from the carpark, there is an automatic sensor of some kind that you trigger by driving towards the gate. Pretty simple stuff.

***

This afternoon I'm queuing up to leave with one car in front of me and one behind. The car in front of me approaches the gate as per usual... but nothing happens - the gate doesn't move. One very frustrated PE teacher hops out of her SUV and starts walking towards the front office to try and figure things out. 

I think to myself ""I've got this"", and hop out of the car saying that I'll try my key on the reader on the other side of the gate (there's another open gate for pedestrian access). With all eyes upon me I wave my RFID key in front of the reader which gives me a reassuring beep and the gate... does nothing.

I think to myself ""Oh well"" and turn around to head back to the car to wait for someone else to solve this issue while I sit in air conditioned comfort.

Then I see it.

On the far side of the gate.

Cheekily poking up out of the garden.

A [switch.](https://i.imgur.com/fRUkX9s.png)

I think to myself. ""Hmmm""

I reach through the bars of the gate.

I turn that switch off.

I turn that switch back on again.

I try the RFID key.

The gate... opens.

A small queue of very relieved teachers proceed to exit the school.

Altrissa,It's...What?,"​Hello!

About 13-ish years ago, I was an oil and gas programmer who specialized in building plant and well systems. Since we didn’t have a support department, any issues would come directly back to me to deal with. I had my fair share of PEBKAC calls, but my absolute favourites were ones that had nothing to do with the end users. This is one such story.


One day I received a call from a client who wasn’t getting any gas to their plant. I checked our system and everything was reporting as fine. The well was pumping and there were no blockages, but nothing was coming down the pipeline.


I spent hours going over the code to see what was going on, but nothing made sense. Every ping I sent came back fine..it should have been working. Finally, I saw no choice but to send a tech out to the site and see what was going on. We were lucky that we not only had a tech in the area but they also had a helicopter ready. 
The well site was in a far northern corner of Canada - only accessible by helicopter during the warm months or by an ice road during the winter.


As the tech neared the site, he called me on his satellite phone.


“I’m almost to the site, but everything looks fine...oh.”


The tech suddenly went quiet and I thought I had lost him, until he spoke again.


“It’s on fire.”


I asked him to repeat himself, since I couldn’t have heard that right.


Apparently there was a storm a few days prior and lightning had hit the site. Miraculously, the reporting computer (called an RTU) hadn’t been fried but the lightning strike had punctured part of the above ground portion of the pipeline and set it alight. Because the RTU saw nothing wrong, it continued to pump the gas...directly into the flame, continuously feeding the fire. By sheer luck, the flame was shooting in a vertical geyser with no wind..I shudder to think how bad the forest fire would have been had the wind shifted.


I turned off the well remotely so the tech could land safely and patch up the pipeline.


And that is how fire became my favourite excuse as to why a well wasn’t working. (Well, that and bears. Those were fun calls too.)

Edit: changed one instance of the word “gasoline” to “gas”. I meant gas, as in natural gas. Need to stop proof reading late at night..",talesfromtechsupport,1738,1517635475

Zaofy,Don't use the Service Desk to try to get out of an important meeting,"Hi there TFTS! Obligatory LTL/FTP and not my story but a friends.

We work at a fairly large company which encompasses ~30k users. The Service Desk consists of around 50 people total, of which around a dozen are around at the same time. There's no real second level support, there's just the First Level, the providers and engineering.
We also do Tech support for companies working for us.

This is the story of my friend, who shall be called **$Friend**, who works at the SD as something like an unofficial 1.5 level support.

The story also stars:


First Level Supporter **$FirstLevel**

Friend of Friend who also works at the Service Desk **$FOF**

and the reason this story is told:

Angry Customer from one of those external companies **$AC**



It's a normal day at the Service Desk. Calls and E-Mails come in. Some good, some bad, the usual.

**$FirstLevel** receives a call from **$AC**

&gt;""I can't access $ImportantFile on your sharepoint! I need it ASAP for an important meeting!""
**$FirstLevel** does his duty in trying to help the user and tells him that they get it back as quickly as possible but they'd have to send it to **$Provider** because the Service Desk does not have access to it themselves and that  he'll mark it as urgent.

&gt;""You'd better get this solved quickly because you're costing my company lots of money if I can't make that meeting!"" **slam**

**$FirstLevel** writes the ticket, marks it as urgent and sends it off to **$Provider**.

Virtually that second the customer calls again and gets on the phone with **$Friend**
&gt;""Where's my goddamn File! I've already called you and I don't have it. I'm cancelling the meeting and I'm going to bill your company for the loss of sales!""

Now the Service Desk is small enough that you can usually hear somebody screaming over the phone nad people do talk to eachother, so **$Friend** knew that this guys last call was about a minute ago. What's even better is that **FOF** who was sitting next to him had worked at **$Company** before and knew that guy.

So **FOF** called the CIO of **$Company** with whom he was still on good terms with.

While **$AC** was still losing his shit on the phone, threating everyone about the money he'd loose from not being able to attend the important meeting, the CIO walked to his place.
&gt;""Excuse me **$AC**. May I check something?""
*clickety click*

&gt;""Is that the file you were looking for *$AC*? Because it appears to be completely unfinished not in any way suitable for that sales meeting you just cancelled.""

This was where the call broke off.

But **$FOF** heard through the grapevine that **$AC** no longer works at **$Company** and had already pulled off similar stunts, but this was the first time he'd been caught.


tl;dr: Angry Sales guy tries to blame IT to get out of a meeting he didn't prepare for, gets shafted because IT guys know each other.

DJ1NF3RN0,My keyboard and mouse aren't working!,"Another story from the world of charity IT support, and the completely inept users that come with it!

We had a call on Monday (yesterday) that a user's wireless keyboard and mouse had stopped working and they had lost their wireless transmitter from their ""hard drive"". *(They meant computer. I know.)* However they had also tried a different wireless K/B &amp; M with no joy. We arranged to go on-site today (Tuesday) and essentially just have a look for the transmitter, under the guise of troubleshooting.

I get to the office and see the computer switched off, and the user nowhere in sight... *relieved sigh*. I press the power button and there's no display on the monitor. ***Hmm***. 

Basic troubleshooting ensues, discharge static, check cable connections, reboot a few times, nothing works. Look online to see what the numbers on the front of the PC are indicating and it turns out to be bad RAM. Re-seat both modules and hey presto! Hello *4Tiles*!

Get to the login screen, K/B &amp; M work fine. I let their co-worker know and I'm on my way.

(I promise all of this has been important, but this is where it gets interesting)

While I'm still in the building the user comes back and finds me, and asks me what I did (although we all know she wouldn't have a clue what I was talking about anyway). The following conversation ensues:

&gt;Me: So I came in and the computer wasn't booting. It turned out the RAM wasn't seated properly so I re-seated it and the PC then booted fine, and the Keyboard and Mouse worked fine too. You said you moved the PC, what did you mean?

&gt;User: Well the Hard Drive fell over

OH

&gt;and it hasn't worked since.

WELL NO SHIT

&gt;Me: Okay, that'll be the cause then. Well it's all working now.

&gt;U: Where did you find the receiver?

&gt;Me: It was plugged in to the front of the PC, I moved it to the back but I assume that's the one from the other Keyboard and Mouse you said you got from another desk?

&gt;U: There was one in the front? I never saw it! Well thank you so much! 

I've never left an office so quickly before in my life. ",talesfromtechsupport,797,1517315913
DigitalPlumberNZ,"You fixed it, therefore you broke it. Or: The Change Freeze that Broke My FTP Server.","Hi TFST. FTP, etc.

Let me regale you with a story of FTP woe and the ""change freeze"" that wasn't.

Cast:  
* $Me: yours truly, DigitalPlumberNZ, at the time lead system admin for $Employer, well versed in the ways of firewalls and networks and related services  
* $Colleague: a colleague and friend, not as good with networking but far better with the [eighth layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_8) of the OSI model  
* $DataSource: a client that sent $Employer globs of financial transaction data, said data being used by $Employer for other service offerings so their receipt was business-critical  
* $Employer: an analytics consultancy  
* $RM: client relationship manager at $Employer responsible for the $DataSource relationship. $RM had a grudge from the time two years previous that I over-shot a delivery deadline by three hours  
* $0000FF: $DataSource's outsourced IT vendor

Important detail: The files from $DataSource to $Employer were sent via active FTP. It was over IPsec VPN, before anyone does what I did when I first found out that it was classic FTP and freaks the heck out.  
The November before this took place we'd migrated every client that sent/received data across to a new server that only had SFTP enabled. Every client, that is, except $DataSource, whose relevant manager had announced to us **after** the cut-over date (when they suddenly couldn't connect), that, actually, he never agreed to moving to SFTP and the change he'd approved was just altering the endpoint to use the new server's IP address.  
Much rage emanated from my desk that day, but business need overrode technical purity and so ProFTPD sullied my beautiful CentOS box. This entire story would not have happened if the SFTP cut-over had been total and final.

One early-January Thursday, whilst I was on holiday and still recovering from management's distinctly questionable decision to have us move into a new office that was still being built-out *literally* the week before Christmas (maybe a story for another day), **$Colleague** sent me an IM:

&gt; Hey, sorry to bug you on holiday, **$Me**, but the data files from $DataSource have been empty since Tuesday. Looks like they're connecting because the files are being created, but they're zero-length. Could you please do the needful and check the firewall logs?

Implicit in $Colleague's request was ""I hate trying to interpret the firewall logs"", despite pfSense having a pretty nice UI for the task.

I dutifully logged into the firewall and checked the logs, ensured the appropriate rules were logging, and confirmed that, yes, they were indeed doing the needful at the FTP session layer.  

&gt; **$Me**: It all looks fine. PfSense logs say they're getting connected, and as you say the files are being created. Could be something funky with FTP. They changed anything?

&gt; **$Colleague**: Well, they're proclaiming ""change freeze"", of course. But I spoke with someone from $0000FF who said that - on deep background, and totally deniably as far as $DataSource is concerned - they'd made an emergency change to the network. Nothing to do with $DataSource, though.

*Note: down here in the antipodes our change freeze periods often commence mid-November, at latest early in December, and are mostly not lifted until the second week of January when most of the workforce is expected back from Christmas holidays. As $DataSource is in retail financial services, their change freeze was longer than many to avoid disrupting their customers' Christmas shopping.  
Crying ""change freeze"" to deflect allegations of complicity was entirely plausible had it not been for the side comment, which of course was never going to be relayed to $DataSource because, well, it couldn't possibly have been related. We never did find out what was changed, either.*  
**We** had very definitely **not** changed anything, because nobody except me would touch the firewall or the transfer server except in the event of an unscheduled outage, and I had been on holiday since right before Christmas.

&gt; **$Me**: Well, something is rotten in the state of $DataSource, but it's the first week of January and I care not to do more diagnosis. It ain't the firewall, so if you figure it out, awesome, and if not it'll still be broken on Monday. My Big-Barrel-o'-Fornications[tm] is empty, I'm going back to dad-on-holiday mode.

I wasn't just being cavalier, early January was pretty quiet and nothing going on needed to-the-day data at that time. They'd already got two consecutive 60-to-70-hour weeks from me with the move.

Come Monday, it had been a consistent barrage of empty files over the previous nights. Something was well awry, and it fell to your intrepid narrator to go glitch-hunting. First stop was to get a contact in the department of $DataSource that generated the data files, so I could have them re-transmitted on demand. 

Figuring that SELinux is the bane of many an admin, and wondering if something had somehow changed about how they were sending the files, I set SELinux to permissive and restarted ProFTPD then asked the contact for a re-transmit. Empty file, nothing in audit.log, one potential scratched off the list.  

Next, check for updates. Nope, nothing coming down, and no ""yum update"" run since before Christmas. Not a recently-patched bug, and not a new bug. Next cause scratched.  

Wanting to verify that their user could actually upload content, I FTP'd in (do **not** ask me why the previous system admin kept a record of every client's password, but that day I was thankful he had!) as $DataSource and uploaded a file. And another, and another. Then I punched the necessary holes in the firewall and did the same from a box totally off our network.  
Active FTP, passive FTP, SFTP, totally unable to reproduce the issue. Every single file transferred successfully, and hashed the same at both ends, at sizes from a couple of MB to hundreds of MB. This issue was specific to files sent by $DataSource, not replicable as their user, and not affecting any of the other two-dozen clients uploading files (via SFTP) to this server.  

By now, $RM was also back from holiday and demanding to know what was wrong. I showed her the modification timestamps on the ProFTPD config files, dated early December. I showed her that the ProFTPD binaries were dated at the time of it being installed prior to Christmas. I showed her the login logs from the transfer server, again showing nothing since before Christmas and then after we got notified. I showed her the admin login logs from the firewall, from the last day that I worked in December and then none until after we got notified of the error. To me it was pretty clear that this was not down to a change performed by us, and she seemed to accept that. Her feathers apparently somewhat smoothed, I went back to diagnosis.  

Getting stuck for possibilities, I turned the debug up to 11 and also fired up WireShark; turns out that even with allll of the debug turned on ProFTPD is not very verbose about what's happening with transactions, but hooray for plain-text connections. Some more transfers from my off-net box got a baseline for normal, so then I requested another transfer from $DataSource.  
Looking through the packet captures, what became obvious was that the $DataSource server was not setting up the data channel. The control channel came up, the STOR command came through (hence the empty file), but the connection back from our transfer server to the $DataSource server for the data channel didn't get established.

*Background: for those not familiar with [the intricacies of FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) (you lucky, lucky people!), for reasons buried in the depths of time it uses* **two** *TCP connections: one for control, initiated by the client to TCP/21 on the server; one for data transfer, initiated by* **the server** *~~to~~ from TCP/20 to a random port ~~on~~ advised by the client. That is known as active FTP, and is the [original standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc959).  
For many reasons, allowing a client computer to accept inbound connections makes many levels of IT administrator uncomfortable, so ""passive FTP"" was introduced with the server listening on and then advising the client of an arbitrary port in TCP/1024-65535 to connect to to establish the data channel. Still two channels, one for control and one for data, but with both connections initiated by the client to the server.*

With $0000FF's assistance useless (the network guys and the mainframe guys are separate teams, and neither could initiate a transfer or monitor logs all the way through), I was left with radical surgery: replace ProFTPD. The other common FTP server software in use on Linux is vsftpd, so I disabled ProFTPD and did the needful. After confirming that I could send files with active FTP as the $DataSource user, I asked my contact to initiate a transfer...  
And, sunnavabitch, it worked! So did the next one. Then I turned ProFTPD back on instead, and the transfer failed. Back to vsftpd and the transfer worked again. So did that night's transfers. It all looked the same with WireShark, but *something* was glitchy when it came to ProFTPD and the $DataSource server. Never did figure out what, either, but it kept on working through the coming year and as best I'm aware continues to work.  

Epilogue: the following day, when we'd had successful overnight transfers and the ticket from $DataSource was closed, I was talking to $RM in the office kitchen.  
&gt; **$Me**: That was bloody weird. No idea what went wrong, but I was not confident that I was going to get it fixed.  
&gt;**$RM**: Yeah, I didn't have any confidence that you could fix it either. At least you figured out what you'd done to break it *walks away*

TL;DR: Client had an unscheduled network change during a change freeze that supposedly wouldn't affect file transfers, so wasn't acknowledged by their support provider; we demonstrably changed nothing whatsoever. File transfers broke, and we got the blame because client was under ""change freeze"". Fixed it by swapping out one piece of FTP server software for another, which just sheeted home the blame further. Wouldn't have happened at all if client had shifted to SFTP as had been agreed to happen a couple of months prior.

Edit: formatting  
Edit2: thanks to u/yuubi for pointing out that it's a source port of TCP/20 on the server not a destination port of TCP/20 on the client for the data channel. See, **so** whack!",talesfromtechsupport,742,1517264707
OblivionCreator,The Tale of the iPad Without Internet.,"*So, quick backstory, I used to volunteer at a computer repair shop near where I lived. Often if a customer brought in a machine, we'd take a look at it on the front desk so that we could guess what the issue likely was and whether a) If e could repair it at all and b) Give them an estimate of cost. This also meant that if we could fix the problem right on the desk, we'd give the device back without charge.*

One day, I and a coworker (Who will be called CO because I'm original) were working the front desk, it was a pretty uneventful day until what appeared to be a mother and daughter walked into the store, and approached us. I went into my usual spiel of
&gt;""Hi, welcome to $STORE, how can I help you?""  

At which point the mother says something along the lines of
&gt;""We bought this iPad a few days ago, and the internet on it doesn't work, do you know what's wrong?""

Before even looking at the iPad, we established that we didn't work with apple products due to difficulty repairing them, but we would give it a cursory look as the store wasn't busy. The daughter hands us the iPad, at which point CO signs into our Guest Wi-Fi and goes onto Google, which all works perfectly.

Of course, both me and CO look at the customers slightly confused, with the customers returning the same look of confusion. The mother swears that it wasn't working before, and looks at the iPad herself, internet working completely fine. She proceeds to ask us how we got it working, at which point we show her the settings, how we signed into our public guest WiFi and then navigated to Google.

CO then asks whether or not they had a router, which they responded to with a yes. He then asks if they knew how to log into their WiFi, which is met with some confusion. Turns out, neither of the two even knew you HAD to connect to the WiFi, assuming it'd work straight out of the box.

CO quickly explains the process of getting the information from the router, before sending the pair on their way, whilst I sit there in confused silence.

And that's the tale of the iPad without internet.",talesfromtechsupport,904,1517200417
cerebralonslaught,That time I helped automate 20 people out of a job,"Since the day I started at this small company I noticed their workstations were horribly out of date and reaching end of life for support and depreciation. I worked with a developer to get our in-house software to run on new machines with much more CPU+GPU to run everything.

Fast forward about a year when the project is complete and the application can now finish its processing in 10-40x less time depending on difficulty. We have everyone on new systems that run like a dream and everyone is thrilled with how much more we can do in a day.

sdragonite,Brad doesn’t know how programming works.,"While I’m sure stories like this have been posted before, this happened today in a work meeting I was in.
I work at a bank (no hints) and we have a rather old computer system that is used to transfer the raw data from our “real” banking system to readable and user friendly format. This system has been relatively unchanged for years, and thats because it works. It has few bugs, when it crashes it comes back up quickly, and it does everything we need it to. 
Now in our work meeting today, we were talking about a new Service Complaint check box thats been added to our SoftPhone program (the phone program that connects our desktop to our telephone) and we use the check box to mark when a call includes a service complaint from a customer. 
I have a coworker (lets name him Brad) who brought up this box in the meeting. He said, rather coy, “Why not just add the complaint box to (banking system)?” 
The presenter says “Oh we’ve definitely tried work it in but its near impossible. The system we have is good where it is and changes can cause problems. We’ve been working on a solution to add it but it looks bleak at the moment.” 
This causes Brad to go on a tirade, saying things including “Well maybe if the IT department wasnt lazy and could do their jobs we wouldnt have to do extra work” and “They can do it, they just wanted to take the easy route.” 
I’m not a programmer, but I know how touchy code can be and I’m ASSUMING they tried quite a few ways to add this feature and it upset something that caused the system to crash (and this is our main program we use; if it goes down, anything we do would essentially be impossible.) 
Brad and the presenter fight back and forth about this for about 10 minutes before the manager makes them move on. Brad is a real meat head guy. I asked him when we got back from the meeting “Brad, do you know programming? Because what you’re asking is similar to putting windshield wipers on a horse and buggy.” 
He says to me “No, but I know computers. It’s not that hard to move some stuff around.” ",talesfromtechsupport,1277,1516922732
PM-ME-UR-CUTE-SMILE,"""Yes, the cable is plugged in! Do you think i'm stupid?""","So a little background. I was working in a small startup firm that worked together with big ISPs. So we offered to install internet installations to customers and give them 1st/2nd-line support. If we couldn't fix it, we would send the ticket to the ISP for 3rd line support. We were short on employees and I liked to do them both, so my days were split in 3-days support(Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and 2 days installation(Tuesday, Thursday).

One day a customer calls (Wednesday):

**$TECH1:** ""Hello, how can I help you?""

**$CUSTOMER1**: ""Yes hello, my internet isn't working. It worked fine yesterday.""

**$TECH1:** ""Ok, Have you tried turning off and then restarting the modem?""

**$CUSTOMER1:** ""Yes, but nothing happens, not even the blinking lights turn on.""

**$TECH1:** ""Oh, maybe your modem is defect. But maybe a stupid question: Is your cable plugged in?""

**$CUSTOMER1:** ""YES OFCOURSE MY CABLE IS PLUGGED IN! DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID? I REQUEST A NEW MODEM INSTALLATION NOW"". 

**$TECH1:** ""Ofcourse, sir, how about tomorrow at 9AM?""

**$CUSTOMER1:** ""YES THANK YOU!"" 

He hung up immediately. Because it was Wednesday, I had installation the following day, so I would go to this customer. I brought my tools + a shiny new modem. I sat down at the customer's modem and what do you know? The power cable is unplugged. I plugged it back in and it worked again. You could see the dread and shame in his eyes when I told him the problem. ""B-but, it was plugged in, I swear!"". 

We had a policy and the customers knew this: If it's our fault, it's free, if it's your fault, you pay. It wasn't a huge bill, but a bill nonetheless. Customer wasn't happy, but that's part of the game.",talesfromtechsupport,1238,1516868569

**BACKGROUND**  

I just got hired by **$ITFirm** to run two depts in IT for a financial services company (**$FINSRV**). They send two techs from a contracting firm (**$TEMP1** and **$TEMP2**) for initial setup help because I am currently the only IT person in the office of over 150 people, and this needs to be done by next Monday apparently. 
They have no servers, no machines, no desks, nothing at this point. Everything is delivered on TUESDAY and I supposedly have to unbox all the infrastructure (while **$MAINT** is setting up power to the suite, as well as the desks; **$CABLING** company is running/ installing the racks/jacks/cabling/panels), install the servers in the racks, set everything up, then unbox and set up around 160 user machines.   
Realizing that this was pretty much impossible in the time they allotted for it, they sent me temporary help from 3 hours away. :|


So... it's WED, I have the servers installed, I'm on bridge calls with about ten people trying to finish configs and setups, and there are **$TECH1** and **$TECH2** plugging away outside the network/server room, unboxing and setting up machines. I'm under the gun, understaffed, don't have the infrastructure in place yet to even get this done, and every time I walk past the training room which has 9 machines to be set up in it, **$TECH2** is texting, and messing around on his phone, or staring off into space. **$TECH1** has the suite unboxed by 10am, and a bunch of machines fully set up by noon. **$TECH2** however, is in a training room of 9 machines that I unboxed before they came that morning. He didn't finish setting up the 5th machine by the end of the day.     






**EPIC OKEY-DOKE**  -please forgive the formatting, I just copied it from FB with minimal changes    




I don't normally enjoy being an ass to people just to be mean. I have no qualms with doing it when it's needed. However... today I HAD to; and I admit, I did it in a manner that I enjoyed a little.   
I have an employee who just...doesn't...listen. yesterday I had him setting up workstations in a training room, it took him 8 hours to plug in 5 computers and set them up. I told him about 10 times he needed to be doing things a lot faster. He asks the same question 3 times after I just told him the answer, and I watch him on his phone for 20 minutes at a time after I tell him to put it away.   
So... I fired **$TECH2**. Got ahold of his contracting company and arranged someone else to show up today, and last night told **$TECH2** we won't be needing him anymore. I was nice about it, didn't allude to him being deficient or anything of the sort.   


But today, **$TECH2** shows up for work. I'm dumbfounded for a bit. Like... really? Then it dawns on me, I suppose I had to tell him everything yesterday 3 times, I don't know why this would be any different. So I tell him this morning, nicely...     


&gt;""we don't need you anymore. Your company sent us someone else. Sorry but 'thems the breaks'. Wish you luck, do you need help gathering your things? ""  


Made it pretty clear. 


He says:

&gt;""well I was contracted for at least three days work"".   



I tell him we only needed him for one and we have someone else now. He actively ignores me and asks a question about the work. So I tell him (at this point i'm getting a little annoyed), 
  


&gt;""this is no longer your concern. We have someone else on the project and I can't have anyone who isn't cleared by security on this floor. So please gather your things and I'll show you out if you need me to.""   





He stares off into space then says he's missing his knife. So I walk around and help him find it, then he stands there and starts trying to talk to the new guy **$TECH3** who's watched most of this conversation. **$TECH3** and **$TECH1** blow him off and **$TECH2** walks over to where his things are and putz's around for another 5 minutes, and looks like he is just killing time so he can bill his Contracting company. I can almost hear the sound of my boss' butthole tightening at the lost time and wages of this whole debacle. I.E. This guy just milking my time, and his own, when so much is yet to get done, SO a solution pops in my head. 


I stand up with purpose and make it a production, and say   





&gt;""ya know what? I have an Idea! Grab your stuff quick and come with me.""  






 He gets a little excited like he's somehow convinced me to put him back to work. I walk to the door of our suite with him and I step out and point to a locked door on the other side of the floor. And as he walks out, I kick the prop out from under the door we just exited and step inside. Then I stand there silently as it closes super slowly. It's almost completely glass. Once it closed I took a moment to stand there and watch the whole reality of what just happened set in. I watched **$TECH2's** facial expressions change as he went from hopeful albeit willfully ignorant, to disappointed, to mad, when he realized I just tricked him into walking out the door so I could close it behind him. I smiled, I admit.


Part of my brain tells me I should feel bad, but this guy wasted one full day of three days I have to get this project done. So nope. I don't.

I work in tech support and right now there’s an issue printing from a specific browser aka I.E.

Me: Thank you for calling IT how can I help?

User: Yeah I can’t print. 

Me: Are you using I.E. 

User:  what’s that?

Me: it is an internet browser with a blue e and a gold or yellow line going through it. 

User: oh yeah. That’s it. 

Me: ok right now we have an outage printing from that. Do you mind if I remote in to double check? 

User: that’s fine. 

-remotes in and sees she’s going thru IE and indeed can’t print-

Me:  ok. So the workaround is to go through this other browser. 

-shows where the browser is and asks user to login to the place they need to print from-

User instead of using the window I just opened they just go to a link that automatically opens in IE. 

Me: I see where the site is already opening in IE. Can you copy the link and paste it into this browser. 

User; what do you want me to do?

Me: ......-shows her and she puts her wrong login on the site-

User: here let me try this....

She goes back and clicks on the site again which -again- opens in IE. 

Me: I see where the link seems to be opening in IE can you copy the link and paste it into this other browser?

User: I just did that and you told me not to do it. 

..... this goes on for another minute or so just to get to the site and eventually she prints............

Me: ok great! I’ll be happy to submit a ticket for you today for your IE. Would you also like the other browser to be your default browser until this gets completed?

User: No that’ll be too complicated thanks. -click-

Sigh. 

TLDR:  I tell a user not to print from IE and to open another browser and she tries to print in IE anyway. ",talesfromtechsupport,1260,1516719251
megamanxtc,"""So, I'm not allowed to connect wirelessly anymore?""","HR User calls in about not being able to access the intranet as of Friday.

They use a laptop that connects wirelessly to the network, with only a powercord plugged into it at their desk.  They can access the Internet just fine.

Found the user was on a network we have set aside for guest users called, ""Guest WiFi.""  The user should be on our corporately named network.  
Switched the user over to the corporate network and they are able to connect to the Intranet.

User comes back and informs they can't get on the intranet again.  Find them again on the guest network.  Remove the network and connect them again to the corporate network asking them to not use the Guest WiFi.  
User gets angry and says, ""So I'm not allowed to connect wirelessly anymore?""  
Inform the user that they're still connected wirelessly, just the network has a different name.

quadpiece,Let's print a boat,"About an hour before lunch I was sitting in my office like one does. A couple helpdesk calls here and there, but generally pretty calm. I work at a shipyard, so most my jobs are either the normal forgotten passwords, or they're some weird production machine with embedded Windows that broke.

During this time I got a quick call from the receptionist one floor below me:

&gt;$receptionist: ""Hi, $me. The plotter in the copy room just prints black on the paper. Could you take a look at it?""  
&gt;$me: ""Sure, I'll be there in a moment""

When I arrived a minute later I realized there had been a couple of misunderstandings. Or should I just say ""sparse info"".

The receptionist didn't mean a plotter. She was talking about the A0 photo-grade printer. (Canon iPF-750)  
It didn't print black when you asked it to print something. It was constantly printing black.  
There was a giant string of A0 paper, at least 10-15 meters long sprawled onto the floor. With pure black printed on it.

I tried to click cancel. But it didn't stop. It just said ""Finishing current job"" and I could tell that would never end. So I rushed back to my office and logged onto the print server and killed the print job. Then I went back down and pulled the power for the printer, and plugged it back in manually (Had to delete the job first. Otherwise it just retries)

The printer managed to spew out what was at least another 10-15 meters during the time it took me to get back to my floor and then back down to pull the power. Making for a total of at least over 20-30 meters.

I had noted which user sent the job, so I walked over to their office and had a talk. He was an engineer:

&gt;$me: ""Heya, did you sent a print job to the printer in the copy room not too long ago?""  
&gt;$engineer: ""I did, why are you asking?""  
&gt;$me: ""Well there was a slight issue, could I see the file you were trying to print?""  
&gt;$engineer: ""Sure, it's this CAD drawing""  
&gt;$me: ""Ah I see, these seem to be drawings for a ship.""  

So I opened the print settings and had a quick look. The problem was pretty obvious.

&gt;$me: ""You see this setting called scale? I'd recommend not leaving that at 1:1. Especially not when 'Fill' is set to Solid Color""  
&gt;$engineer: ""S**t.""

**TL;DR**: Engineer printed CAD drawings for an entire ship (About 70 meters in length I'd assume) with scale set to 1:1 and fill set to Solid Black. Didn't even use the plotter, used the expensive color printer.

**Proof**: [Here](https://twitter.com/Kuwaddo/status/868084915061051393). I sort of regret that I never laid it out and took a picture of the entire print job. But that's too late to sob over now.

deadthylacine,Please stop poking buttons.,"I recently moved from a vendor support job to a general support job in a much larger company.  There's a lot to adjust to, but the largest change is the variety of problems encountered.  Before, I was pretty much only dealing with dead SQL servers, strange data input, or major bugs in code, now I get asked to fix everything and anything.

At this new job, we have a ticketing system where users can submit their own cases to be reviewed.  My favorite ticket, may it never be dethroned, is this: 

&gt;SCREEN IS PURPLE

That's all the user wrote.  The whole ticket.  Just, the screen is purple.  Not anything useful like what screen, where, or what was going on when it became purple.  Thankfully, the system requires that cases be attached to a username so we can look up contact information.  I was able to call and get her location and sent a local tech to investigate.  Someone had monkeyed with the monitor's settings, and the local tech was able to mash buttons until it looked right again.

But not even a week later, I get another ticket from the same user:

&gt; SCREEN WAS PURPLE NOW YELLOW.

She'd done it again.  Hopefully, when the local tech fixed it this time they gave her instructions about not pressing any buttons on the monitor.

Isoldael,"""My laptop won't start and it had all my family photos on it!""","I volunteer at the local repair café, and we basically do tech repairs on whatever item people bring in. I specialize in computers and smartphones, mostly software related things since we don't carry parts (although if people bring parts, I'm happy to replace them).

Either way, a woman walks in, panicked and nearly in tears. She shows me her laptop and tells me it won't start at all, it just gives her a black screen, and it had all her family photos so she's really afraid she lost them. Usually when we get this kind of issue, it means a fried hard drive or motherboard, in which case there's not much we can do. I mentally brace myself to tell the woman her pictures are lost and she should see if she can have a recovery company look at it as I hook it up to power and start the laptop.

Surprisingly, the manufacturer's logo comes up. Not bad. Next, it goes to a black screen with some text at the top. ""Yes! That's the black screen!"" the woman says.

I have a look at the text. It says:

&gt; Battery replacement recommended. Press enter to continue.

I press enter... and the laptop starts normally. The woman audibly ghasps. ""It's working! Thank you, thank you! You have no idea how much those photos mean to me. My mother passed away recently, and these are years worth of photos.""

I made a backup of her photos on a USB drive she brought, recommended she get an external harddrive for backups and come back next time to let me help her get it set up, removed the battery (she said she only used it while plugged in) and sent her on her way. 

It's easy to get annoyed with people for not even trying to read error messages and such, but seeing the relief in her eyes (she even teared up a little) made any annoyance melt away.

The bucket company assures you that you only need to pour out some water from the full bucket to make room for the other one. Some of it's probably dirty river water or something. Go pour some water out into the river, they say, so that you can put more, better water in the bucket you like.

You pour an extremely small amount of old crappy water into the river, grumbling the whole time. You see that there is now a tiny amount of extra space left in the bucket.

Yeah, that sucks, but usually we use wireless HDMI sticks (what a pain in the ass...) and well, he doesn't have it.  
  
Anyway, he chose to answer my question if we could move his laptop like 30cm (1 foot) to the side with a snarky remark along the lines of ""do you think I'd stand here if there was no need to"".

CipherTheTerminator,I know you're kind of busy with breathing and all...,"I've told this story before elsewhere. tl;dr at the bottom.

**Background**

We have a newly-built three-host VMware vCenter cluster backed with a combination of a VNXe3150 and (very sadly) a Windows 2008 R2 server as an iSCSI mountpoint for the much less critical storage; backup are via Veeam as B2D2T (UGH!). After much wailing and gnashing of teeth the design - including monitoring and both VM and storage failover - has been configured and tested. We're shaking out the design, but it's working as advertised. My design, my build, and it works!

**Situation**

I get an email from my (non-PHB type) boss reporting that the monitoring system is going insane and vCenter itself isn't stating online. What the hell, it's a Saturday afternoon, it's cold outside, and I'm bored and tired.

Log into the VPN, take a look around for a few hours, determine the issue's cause is kind of simple - the log retention is over-running the MSDE database size (max 10GB) because I neglected to take this into account. But to fix it requires vCenter to be online, and that's not happening because... you see the catch-22 it's in.

**Solutions**

Although vCenter is down and the alerting system is going nuts (all the Opsview monitoring points to vCenter services, which is down and red-lighting the place) there's no real danger of production data loss. If there's a host failure we can manually fail over the VM guests and clean it up later.

 Copy and paste the URL to the email for fixing it via root login and CLI and tell Boss either he can do it or I can, but if it's me I'd rather wait until I'm on-site to look at it.

He emails back he's going to shut down the monitoring system and wait for me to get back, knowing full well I'm unavailable for at least two months... 

*Two months??!* I can hear you say. Well, yes. I got the ""can you look at this"" email less than twenty-four hours after I got home from having open heart surgery.

**$Sup2** -  All around great supervisor, worked his way up from the support line, understands how the helpdesk works. Worked with $Soda in the past.

&amp;nbsp;

It was the holiday season, and the one of the supervisors of $BiggerCompany had approved time off for just about everyone, including himself. This left $Sup2 in a sticky situation. He was an old acquaintance of $Soda, and quickly hired him and $Selben on for some super short term temp work. The contract was about two weeks - not ideal, but it paid the bills! 

There was only one other tech in the office other than $Sup2, so $Soda and $Selben were covering the phones and doing everything else that came up to the best of their abilities.

&amp;nbsp;

$Selben was in his cubicle. The previous occupant of the desk was apparently a big snacker, as the keys in his keyboard frequently crunched. Several attempts to smack the keyboard against a trashcan had little effect to remove the chips and other crumbs. $Selben's phone began to ring.

&gt; $Selben: Thank you for calling, this is $Selben. How can I help you?

&gt; $User: I can’t login to $CompanySystem!

&gt; $Selben: Oh I see. What error are you getting?

&gt; $User: No Inter…Net… connection!

&gt; $Selben: Can you check to see if you have internet?

&gt; $User: I don’t, I’ll try the WiFi…

A few moments later…

&gt; $User: It’s working now. Thanks!

&gt; $Selben: No problem?

Most of the calls were pretty simple. A few reports had to be moved from an excel document into a special format from the system, and $Selben was also tasked with those. $Soda was happy to inform $Sup2 of ALL the different things $Selben was good at, but it felt more embarrassing than anything else for $Selben. $Soda worked the phones as well, pulling up his charm whenever someone was upset and generally just being $Soda. 

Near the end of the week it seemed more and more employees had gone on vacation and the call queues finally died down, dropping to maybe one or two calls a day which was a nice change.

&amp;nbsp;

One early morning $Selben entered the office, hoping to get a head start on his day. $Soda popped out of the IT area and locked eyes with him. Something was wrong! 

&gt; $Soda: Come with me, we’ve got a level 5 ticket!

&gt; $Selben: Level 5?! I thought it only went to 4?

He spun around and followed $Soda.

&gt; $Soda: $Sup2 said to take you with me, we tried rebooting a critical piece of equipment but no power, nothing!

&gt; $Selben: Did you try a different outlet?

&gt; $Soda: Yep, still nothing. It's dead. $Sup2 wants us to go get a replacement immediately! I'll need your help to get it in the van.

They rushed out to one of the company vehicles. ~~$Selben slid across the hood and dove through the passenger side window.~~ They got into the vehicle and started driving.

$Soda continued explaining all the different steps they took to try to fix it the critical piece of equipment, but it was completely dead. At a red light $Soda pulled out his rapidly dinging phone. He had a flurry of texts from $Sup2 updating him of the situation.

&gt; $Soda: A quarter dozen tickets have already come in. We've gotta hurry!

They pulled into the parking lot of the vendor and headed in. $Sup2 had already organized picking it up over the phone, so they only had to sign some papers before loading it up. They rushed back to the office and carried it inside. One of the front desk admins held the door open for them.

&gt; $DeskAdmin: Hurry!

They quickly went and pulled out the old piece of equipment and installed the replacement. Several users stood around and watched. They heard the slight hum of the machine starting up. A sigh of relief came across the room. One user walked up and gasped.   

&gt; $User: It's not compatible!

They held up a critical component. $Soda ran off and returned with a pair of scissors, and cut down the component to the new, smaller required size. The room stood in awe as he worked. He slowly installed it in the device, and pressed the button to activate it. The burble and sizzle began. Everyone let out a cheer. $Sup2 held up his mug.

&gt; $Sup2: Good work, guys!

Things had been very slow, and unfortunately the office coffee maker had died, leaving the skeleton crew in the office caffeine-less. $Sup2 jokingly created a “Level 5"" ticket, and sent $Selben and $Soda to get a replacement. It was a pretty big piece of equipment, as it was one of those industrial grade types. After plugging it back in, they discovered a different sized filter was needed, so $Soda cut down one of the old ones to get the coffee maker working.

skramzy,I have a user across the country who has been calling me at 5am every morning with the same exact issue for months.,"I do remote equipment support for a disaster relief project in Houston, but work out of an office in California. We use android devices with a proprietary app, paired with bluetooth printers to print tickets to validate material hauling.

Most mornings ( 3 - 4 times a week) at 5am PST, the same user in Houston calls me with the same issue. This is roughly this morning's call:

*The phone rings, I try not to sound audibly tired*

&gt;**skramzy**: Hey man.

&gt;**u**: Hey, skramzy. My phone says it can't open a connection to the bluetooth device? I can't print a ticket.

&gt;**skramzy**: Okay, open Quicksupport.

*We do this every morning, and it's usually faster if I just log in and fix it for him*

&gt;**u**: Quicksupport, quicksupport... okay what's Quicksupport?

&gt;**skramzy**: It's that blue app on the home screen, remember?

*At this point in the call, he usually begins reading every app installed on the phone aloud to me until he says one that sounds like Quicksupport, and my girlfriend laughs at my pain uncontrollably from under the blanket*

&gt;**u**: Drive Mode, Eco Mode, Email File Comma-

&gt;**skramzy**: Wait, wait. No, you don't gotta read all of them to me. Go to the home screen and tap the blue app called Quicksupport.

&gt;**u**: Oh, Quicksupport, I got it. Send my ID?

&gt;**skramzy**: No, you can just read the ID numbers out loud to me.

*Turns out his service is too poor to maintain a connection, so I start chipping away at explaining it to him.*

&gt;**skramzy**: Okay, go to settings.

&gt;**u**: Okay.

&gt;**skramzy**: Now you should see an option called bluetooth, select that.

&gt;**u**: Select it?

&gt;**skramzy**: Yeah, select it.

&gt;**u**: How do I do that?

*I mute the phone and physically regroup, groaning to nobody in particular about all my life choices up until now, and what I did in a past life to deserve this*

&gt;**skramzy**: Sorry about that, lost you for a sec. Tap it with your finger, and then turn it off.

&gt;**u**: Okay, done.

&gt;**skramzy**: Now switch it back on, and select, or tap, your printer's name when you see it pop up.

&gt;**u**: Got it, it's asking for a PIN.

*This next part is what I like to call going through the gauntlet. Getting him to type in 1234, and selecting(tapping) enter might not seem like a whole lot to ask, but this guy will find a way to make this much harder than it needs to be*

&gt;**skramzy**: Cool, now just type in 1, 2, 3, 4.

&gt;**u**: Okay, how do I do that?

&gt;**skramzy**: What do you mean? Just press^select^tap 1, 2, 3, 4.

&gt;**u**: I don't see any numbers.

&gt;**skramzy**: Alright, there's a button at the very bottom left of your keyboard that shows ""123"" on it. You'll have to touch that to toggle on numbers.

&gt;**u**: Hmm, I don't see that.

&gt;**skramzy**: I promise you it's there -- bottom left, says ""123"". Just need you to touch it with your finger.

&gt;**u**: Oh alright, yeah I got it. 1, 2, 3, 4?

&gt;**skramzy**: Yes, and then touch the button with the check mark. It might say enter or something, I never remember.

&gt;**u**: skramzy, I put in 1, 2, 3, 4,  now what? You said press enter?

&gt;**skramzy**: Yeah, or it might be a check mark. Like I said, I don't exactly remember. 

&gt;**u**: I'm not seeing an enter button skramzy.

&gt;**skramzy**: Then it's probably the green checkmark.

&gt;**u**: Okay. Hey, it's working. Thanks skramzy.

&gt;**skramzy**: No problem man. Now you know that if you get that error again, just go to bluetooth settings, select your printer, type in 1, 2, 3, 4, and hit the check mark. Have a good one, thanks for calling.

But, he'll call again tomorrow, and on Saturday as well. That project should be over with in about a month, but I have a feeling that U's role in my life will just be taken over by another source.

steak1986,Laptop not booting!,"So my coworker today had an interesting call, which is now ranked in our top 3 moments of stupidity.  

MC (my coworker) gets a call from DU (dumb user).  DU says her computer will not turn on and someone needs to come down immediately.  MC talks with her for a few minutes over the phone to try and troubleshoot the issue.  MC is trying to get DU to hold the power button down, maybe it is stuck in a funky state.  After about 2-3 mins of over the phone troubleshooting and some clear frustration MC runs down.

When she gets down there she asks the user to show her what is happening, and DU points to her empty docking station and says ""it wont boot up"".  Face palm......

MC- ""Yeah you need a computer in the docking station to use your computer.""  
DU- ""Oh, i need to have the laptop in the docking station?  """,talesfromtechsupport,823,1515771293
syberghost,Please create a team to keep me from making typographical errors,"I was working on an SA team that managed the dev/test servers for a handful of Very Important Projects for a Fortune 500 megacorp, one of many SA teams there. USER had been working there for over a decade, and should have known how everything worked.

One Saturday morning, I got a page that said nothing but ""what is the status of my ticket?"" I called USER back and had roughly this conversation:

&gt;me: Can you give me the ticket number, so I can look it up?

&gt;user: I don't know my ticket number, you tell me my ticket number. Why is this taking so long? We're dead in the water until this is fixed, it's been 12 hours since I opened the ticket.

&gt;me: 12 hours ago would have been 8pm on Friday, so nobody would have been in the office to see you opened a ticket. Who did you talk to about it?

&gt;user: I didn't talk to anybody, I opened a ticket, the way I've always done. You should be monitoring that queue for issues at all times.

&gt;me: OK, I'm looking at the queue, and I'm not seeing any tickets that came in since yesterday afternoon. The system would have sent you an email with the ticket number, do you have that email?

&gt;user:Look, stop stalling and fix my problem.

&gt;me:OK, I've done a search on the system for tickets opened by you, and it appears you opened a ticket in a completely different queue. So that's why I didn't see it; you didn't send it to us. I'll take a look and call you back when I know something.

&gt;user:It shouldn't matter what queue I open a ticket in, you should be monitoring that 24/7 for issues.

&gt;me:well we're not a 24/7 staffed team, we work regular business hours, we have an oncall for after-hours issues (as she damn well knew, since she paged me) and in any event we wouldn't monitor the other 500 queues, we'd only see things that come to us.

&gt;user:well you need to fix that, it shouldn't matter what queue or when I open the ticket, you need to make sure that any time I open a ticket somebody starts working on it immediately.

&gt;me:OK, I'll pass your suggestion to my manager.

&gt;user:no, don't ""pass my suggestion"" to your manager, you need to take care of this right now.

&gt;me:You want me, personally, to staff three shifts of people seven days a week to monitor 500 ticket queues just in case you open a ticket after hours in the wrong queue?

&gt;user:yes, that is what I want.

&gt;me:OK, I'll get right on that after I look into your issue.

&gt;user:OK. How long will it take to fix my problem?

&gt;me:Oh I already see the problem; you typed one letter in your script name wrong. It's scriptName.ksh not scriptName.sh.

&gt;user:well either should work.

&gt;me:OK. I'll pass that suggestion along to RedHat. I'll close your ticket once the other team passes it to us.

RagingPilot94,The Internet is Down... Well you kind of have to pay for it...,"Hi all! First time posting to TFTS! Will not be my last, thats for sure! Hope I get the formatting right. :) 

First off, some back story. I work for a company that does private air charter as well as aviation maintenance. 

I was initially hired as a Flight Operations guy, but now serve a dual role as SVRAdmin/IT Support Guy as well as Flight Ops. Company discovered I'm good with computers, now I'm the IT guy! 

On to the story. I'll me $me, $K will be my Boss. He's the Flight Operations Manager, all round good guy and really supportive and $H will be our CFO, an old fossil who really should be enjoying his retirement.

So yesterday morning I get a call. (I'm technically on holiday, but because I'm the only IT person in the office, it doesnt really mean I'm on holiday) 

&gt;$K: $me, the office is panicking, the internet is broken and nobody can get any emails! 

&gt;$me: I'd come in and look, but I'm 300km away on holiday. Send me photos of the router and I'll do my best to see if we can sort it, otherwise cry to the Airport's IT Department, they'll help out in a jam

So I review the images, poor guy doesn't know what a router looks like so I got photos of everything with flashing lights... Switches, PABX, Firewall, the works! Lights on the router show the ADSL line is up, but no internet access. I'm about to call $K back when I get a call from him. This is where it gets good!

&gt;$K: I'm sorry to bother you while you're on holiday but I have to ask you if this might be the problem... We were having our morning meeting when $H mentions he hasn't paid the telephone provider for the last 3 months. 

&gt;$me: Well... Umm... If we haven't paid them, they are going to in fact cut our service.

&gt;$K: Oh, yes that does make sense. I'll get on that and have it paid. 

So basically, our ADSL line hasn't been paid for since we had a new phone system installed as we now pay the provider directly for the service instead of the phone company. Finance Department didn't understand we get our internet from the same place and also didn't bother to ask me. So now the company is dead in the water for up to 72 hours until the line is reconnected. 

TLDR: CFO didn't pay phone company for line rental. Internet is now cut off for the rest of the week. ",talesfromtechsupport,3311,1515588062
404SoulNotFound,"It's Not My Fax Machine; or What Do You Mean, The Problem Is On My End?!","Back with another tale from $OnlineSchool, and this one made me wish that I could strangle the user through the phone (a common wish, if stories here hold true). 

*A bit of background for those not familiar: I'm a Student Support Specialist for $OnlineSchool, where adults who never finished High School can complete their requirements and get their High School diploma, instead of settling for a GED. Most of our students are middle-aged/older, and have trouble with some of our technology and systems. I'm not tech support, but I am tasked with helping with ""simple"" solutions.*

$404 - Your tall, dark, and handsome protagonist

$FL (Fax Lady) - A student trying desperately to send a fax

The phone rings, and $404 rattles off the greeting spiel with the same unconscious monotone he usually reserves for praying the Hail Mary and ordering his dessert of choice (""Vanilla vodka, cranberry juice, simple syrup, ice""). $FL comes on the line with the ungodly screech of a fax machine trying to connect in the background.

&gt;$FL: I keep trying to send the documents you guys asked for with my fax machine at work, and it keeps telling me it can't connect. I want to make sure I have the right number.

Off the bat, $404 is pretty happy. $FL isn't blaming anyone, she's looking to fix the problem instead of complain about it. Over-all, it's starting to sound like a pleasant call. $404's guard lowers.

&gt;$404: Well, let's get a look at your account first of all, because if I have to escalate this to IT, they're going to need your information. *Blah, blah, verify, blah* Ok, what fax number are you trying to send it to?

&gt;$FL: *Reads off our main office fax number correctly* Is that right?

&gt;$404: Yes, that's correct. I'm going to give you the supervisor's fax line, see if that one works for you. *Gives fax number for supervisor desk*

$404 hears $FL typing the number into the fax machine, and more horrific screeching. He closes his eyes and thinks of his happy place.

&gt;$FL: It still isn't connecting. Are your fax machines down?

$404 messages his IT guy on $messengerApp, and is told there isn't anything wrong with the fax machines. In fact, one had a fax coming in as they spoke.

&gt;$404: No, Ma'am, nothing wrong with our fax machines, they're functioning well. Is it possible there is something wrong with yours?

$404 should not have asked this question, and he realized it shortly after $FL *huffed* loudly.

&gt;$FL: It's *not* my fax machine. I use it all day, every day for work, it works just fine. There must be something wrong at your offices.

&gt;$404: Well, I have a good way of figuring out where the problem is. Do you have another fax machine there in your office?

&gt;$FL: Yes, I do. 

&gt;$404: I'll send a test fax from my fax machine to another in my office, and you send one from your machine to the other one in your office, and then we'll be able to figure out which one has the problem.

&gt;$FL: It's obvious that the problem is on your end, but fine.

$404 sends a test fax from his machine to the fax machine in the Education department. It goes through as smooth as butter. He also hears the fax machine on $FL's end going through its terrifying mating call of death (and swears that $FL's fax machine is actually some kind of prehistoric monster). 

&gt;$FL: It didn't go through! You people broke my fax machine! Now I have to try on the other one, and that's all the way across the building! 

&gt;$404: Why don't you just scan it to your computer and email it to us? It'll be a lot faster and easier that way.

&gt;$FL: Are you kidding? This document has all sorts of personal information on it. Fax is the only secure way to send it. I'll be sending it from the other fax machine, but I'm going to have someone come look at this one, and if your machine damaged mine, I'll be looking for restitution. *Hangs up*

$404 stares at his web-phone and silently wishes for a case of beer to magically appear under his desk. His wish is not granted.

Phrewfuf,Netnotworking: Wait for it...,"In my previous story someone made a comment about users constantly breaking stuff and blaming the network techs. To no surprise, of course, there is a story about that.

*****

**The Setup**

Remember, in [Snowflake Servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7hy00f/netnotworking_snowflake_servers/), i said how my employer is developing stuff for cars using massive amounts of video and radar data? And how all of it runs on a network where there is no connection below 10GBit? 

Well, there was a recent addition. Someone requested a few special parking spaces for cars. Special as in: 10GBit connection right next to it. Because they have this trunk-filling setup of diagnostic, telemetry and development systems in a few cars from which they need to shovel data into the datacenter as fast as possible without having to rip out drives out of the in-car computers and carry them inside.

They asked for it, i delivered. The ports were set up as regular access ports, which means: Host limit and BPDU-Guard. Which basically equals to: You can't connect switches to these ports. If you do, the port will go into error-disabled state and not come back up by its own.

Guess what they forgot to mention when asking me for those ports?

**The People**

$FCM: One of our facility managers. Small old lady who drives a 2008 Ford Mustang Bullitt, so you can probably guess her personality.

$Eng: An automotive engineer, working with the cars and systems mentioned above.

$Phrewfuf: Do i really need to mention that every time?

*****

**Day 1**

0800 AM. $Phrewfuf is sitting at his desk, sipping hot black coffee...the third one that day. Opening the red-light district aka the monitoring. An orange alert pops up. ""BPDU-GUARD_BPDU-RECV on Port Gi0/1. Port went into ERR-DIS mode."" Alert source? The switch providing network to the parking lot. Either someone looped two ports to each other or connected a switch.

Surprisingly, no ticket to be found about it. Eh, whatever.

**Day 10**

1000 AM. $Phrewfuf is sitting at his desk, sipping hot black coffee. The red-light district is already open. Another orange alert. Same as on Day 1, but for Port Gi0/2, which is the second port on the switch.

Tickets: none. Eh, whatever.

**Day 25**

0200 PM. The coffee machine is broken. $Phrewfuf had to walk 20 meters further to the next one. After coming back and taking another sip...Gi0/3 error-disabled.

Hm...quick dialing $FCM.

&gt; $FCM: Hi, what's up?

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Hey, quick question, did you get any messages or mails regarding the parking lot?

&gt; $FCM: Nope. Why?

&gt; $Phrewfuf: They're doing...something and managed to disable three out of four available ports. 

&gt; $FCM: Huh. Well, they still have one, so it's either fine or not too urgent.

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Eh, whatever. They'll start crying about it eventually.

**Day 40**

0930 AM. The coffee machine has been fixed. Orange alert, Gi0/4 error-disabled. I sit there and wait until my phone rings 10 minutes later.

&gt; $FCM: Hi, remember that call we had about the parking lot?

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Yup...let me guess, you got a mail from them?

&gt; $FCM: Exactly, how do you know?

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Well...monitoring tells me they just killed their last port. Throw me their email, i'll take care of it.


Calling $Eng.

&gt; $Eng: This is $Eng, are you calling because of the network? *He saw my department in Skype*

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Hi, this is $Phrewfuf. Yup, i am. Do you have some time to get to the parking lot and fix it? I'll need to take a look at your setup.

&gt; $Eng: Sure, when do you have time for it? Is it possible to get it done today? We need to push some data.

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Well, i was thinking about right now, i'll just grab my note and walk over to you. In 5 minutes at the lot?

&gt; $Eng: Oh?! Yeah, that's perfect.

The two meet up at the parking lot, two very nice cars are parking there. Nice despite the fact that there are sensors sticking out in a very strange, hacked manner. After asking to, $Eng proceeds to open the trunk of one of the cars and the first thing $Phrewfuf spots is a slight mess of network cables connected to a switch.

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Welp. I knew it. Those switches, who set them up?

&gt; $Eng: My predecessor. He built the systems for the cars, but left before they came to real use.

&gt; $Phrewfuf: I see...did he leave any docu, especially how to configure the switches? We need to apply some changes.

&gt; $Eng: Sure, i'll just connect my box to them.

A few moments later, Spanning-Tree - loop protection, sends BPDU packets which my switches do not like - is disabled on the in-car switches and the ports are reenabled. A quick test shows that all is working fine.

&gt; $Eng: Nice! Now we can transfer all the data, we couldn't do it for a month or so.

&gt; $Phrewfuf: Well...you should've contacted IT-Support earlier, then i could've fixed it then. THen you wouldn't have to panic because of your deadlines. Just open a ticket next time something's wrong.

&gt; $Eng: Yeah...will do. Thanks a lot for your help.

&gt; $Phrewfuf: And please update all the switches in all your cars please. And add the current config to the docu, in case someone else ends up taking over from you.

**TL;DR:** Clean your filthy thing before trying to stick it in the next hole.

Hyperwerk,You dont keep my data without payment? Unacceptable.,"**Intro:**

So  I  work for possibly the largest cloud-storage provider in Scandinavia as part of the tech support team.  This is fine, and I like my job.    However,  sometimes  I fear for us humans in general.  I will skip over the most boring parts, since these cases often get slightly ugly (this was no exception), but all relevant info will be included in a simple form.  This is not necessarily  a happy story, but should be a reminder for everyone paying for similar services.   **TL;DR  provided at the bottom.**   

*Last week, be me, storytime.*


I (Me)  , see a ticket from &lt;Customer&gt;  in our support system of choice,   I'm about to end my shift in 30 minutes, but in any case where we see potential risk of data-loss ,We will prioritize it, and check status quo.

**Customer:**  Hi,  my account is gone and we have not received a e-mail about this. Seems like it expired in July.  Is it possible to do a restore?


I immediately  know that this could turn into a long chat, but I still do the initial checkup ,seeing that this will take me 30 seconds.

**Me:** Hi,  this account was sadly terminated back to  0GB  since we have not received payment  since July.  You should however have received multiple e-mails warning you about this   (I did not have back-end present during the night-shift).    Is  &lt;E-mail&gt;  the correct adress?

**Customer:**  Hi,  yes.  The domain should only do redirects, but it seems it has not done this.

**Ta-da!**   Malconfigured e-mail servers,   exactly why I dont host one for critical stuff.

I continued to tell her how our payment lockdowns worked (7 days for write, 14 for read and 120 for termination,  this is the first scream test.) , when we received the last payment, that we had registered a CC-Change in 2015, but that later the new card was declined when the yearly plan was due for renewal  , and the account later terminated  120 days after payment due date, even though the ToS state 90 days (Second scream test/ extra unofficial buffer.)   Seeing how she was over our 5GB free limit when this happened all data was gone, since we cannot prioritize which data  should be kept.  

Customer continues about how she was not warned, and that we should have a in-app warning.  (Which we do have for all our local versions, but its up to the reseller to enable it in some cases,  this was not one of them.)  She is slightly frustrated, understandably enough.

I respond about how the service was running ""for free"" for about 3.5 months after the lockdown date before  we actually delete  the data.   (120 days in total and about 500GB in this case.)  And how we sadly cannot keep this data forever since we cannot deliver a service that is not paid for by the customer.   We say this date is 90 days in the ToS, but I made it clear that we actually delete for good about 30 days later,  within the hour in most cases.



So again *120 days/4 months /  1/3 of a year.*    This is also the de-facto date that their rights as a customer vanishes completely and the point where this process cannot be reversered.

**In other words:**  The data is long gone being deleted back in the beginning of november,  and was in the delete queue for a maximum of 12 hours.   Automation ftw!    We can do exceptions if warned  before this date, but hindsight will do nothing here. *Its gone. Period.*



**Customer:**  This is meaningless,   and unacceptable.    &lt;Competitor&gt; had warnings via sms.


(**My mind:**  And so do we?    Seems like you have tried these tactics before then?)   

Not to mention that we dont deliver data to  NSA behind their backs, since WE are not legally required to do so. Unlike &lt;Competitor&gt; who both has a history doing this and will never comply with the new EU  GDPR laws until they are forced, but hey each to their own I guess.  Keep in mind that I did not say this to the customer.  I just find it funny.


This is where I want to end the case,  seeing that the data is long gone, and we technically cannot do anything more for the customer but deliver any logs when the correct department is present.

I always find it strange that they do not react when the feedback from the client is not present for this time.  Seeing how its both write, and read locked.


Customer then wants the logs,  mad as hell  and demanding her data back.  I send the ones I can give  immediately, and tell her that the rest will be sent over ASAP.

Customer then gives me a poor rating on the way out where she blames ME for deleting her data.     

 **Nice™**.   *Fingerguns*

The Back-end  team sends mail logs the following day  (18 in total related to the case,  7 related to the last payment, , 3 payment reminders  and one last warning before we sent delete confirmation),  and the  logs from our card-payment provider.   

Was later  determined that the cause  was   Error 0.  AKA card does not work,  and that the reason for this was that it had expired in **2016.**    The service was running happily along since she had a yearly payment plan until July, but after due date the 120 day limit was in effect and counting down.


I never heard back from her.



**Tl;DR:**
Customer did not pay for cloud storage,  data was deleted  and the customer then blamed us.  Even when the service  was assigned this expired card for 11 months in total.


**So what did we learn?**


1. Pay your bills kids.   

2. Dont host your own email if you dont know what you're doing, vital emails could be lost this way.

3.  Change any expired cards for services you want to keep when they expire, and not after the service is terminated underneath your feet, especially crisis-oriented ones like a cloud service.

4. Read the ToS  before you blame the company, otherwise it could be embarrassing for you.



Have a great day.

aki_6,Hey I saved your company... And I quit!,"This story happened a few years ago and it's about how I managed to endure only 2 weeks of an awful job.

As some of you probably know, I'm not officially tech support... but in this particular story I was! Originally I was hired to do interviews and profile evaluations of possible candidates. But when I arrived to this company I couldn't help but notice one thing: every system in the building was wrong in a way, most computers were slow af, and covered in cigar Ash; no network at all despite that being the main purpose of the computers (and the reason why they kept the original IT guy!) not even the printers or internet worked! So I decided to gave it a look, I knew it would make my work easier. Long story short: the IT guy didn't even knew how to use newer versions of windows and was just cashing his checks and giving the company ""computer gibberish that no one understood"" to get off the hook, so it became my job to fix everything, which I did, thankfully. 

Now that I had a functional system I created a python script that automatically created and printed that week payroll (they were doing it by hand!!!), went to be a 3 day job to 15 minutes tops.

And that was just week one, everyone was happy but no one wanted to pay me a rise, never mind two salaries for the two jobs I was doing, not even a little bonus.

The next week I was warned that we would be getting a large transfer worth this company and other 2 smaller companies  monthly payroll for us to administer and the first thing we needed to do was transfer it again to another account and pay everyone for that week. 

The last day available for transfers, two hours before deadline (because you know.. Efficiency and good planning) I saw everyone panicking, smoking and drinking (yes, as in beer). The bank wouldn't accept the transfer, there was no error message and it was to late to contact the bank. Of course the boss was worried he might go to jail for this mistake and maybe the company would be terminated. They forced everyone to stay past our normal work hours just to watch. 

One hour left to do the transfer. 

That was it, I was tired of that company. I went to the office where they did the transfers and instantly noticed the system was old and the bank system was older! It only accepted movements like that in excel 2003 files, they were trying to enter a 2007 file. Corrected it, tried again, no dice.

I convinced my boss that I had to see the excel sheet, maybe it was an error in the file itself. I noticed that someone captured  the data by hand and there were tons of mistakes, but mainly special characters. I quickly created a search and replace function to remove special characters, tried again and it worked! 

&gt;boss: well we solved the problem, everyone is free to go, thank you

What? We did? Not even a small recognition? A bonus for saving your ass? Not even the money for transport so late at night? 

&gt;me: you know what? I quit

&gt;boss: ok whatever, here is your two week check

I left the company just to be called the next week to be informed that the persons who took my spot couldn't handle it and they wanted to hire me as a consultant with less pay of course. Nope, nope, nope. 


The company went bankrupt 2 months after that... Who could have foreseen that? ",talesfromtechsupport,2108,1515083173
enjoyoutdoors,The story about the Set Top Box that was unable to switch channels,"Sweden has a nationwide terrestrial broadcasting grid for TV channels and radio. The TV broadcasts has been purely digital since 2007, and the digital channels were broadcasted in parallel for about a decade before the analog signals were finally phased out.

This story begins in the middle of 2007, when we in my family finally accepted that fact that we had to force my granddad to get a set top box.

I bought one that I had from previous experience kind of appreciated as having no unnecessary extra features, and that was capable of producing error messages on the screen in Swedish, since gramps didn't exactly see the need to learn english just for the sake of the STB, going steady on 90 years old.

It did have one feature though that was unavoidable: it was ANOTHER REMOTE. The horror. The annoyance. The whining. The...you know, the hardships elderly sometimes have adapting to new technology.

It took him quite some time to figure out that there were some buttons on the remote to the tv that was used for some things, and that the tiny, new remote was to be used for all the rest. When I say ""quite some time"" I actually mean that it took probably a hundred phone calls and at least 20 house calls to increase his confidence level to the point where he had it barely figured out.

Once he was confident, though, that's when the problems started.

At fist, it kind of came sneaking up on me. Eventually, it was my standard evening pastime, talking about how to press a specific button ""yes, the one on the third row. it has s symbol that looks like an arrow and a ring, kind of thing. Yes. I'll wait while you fetch the magnifying class. No. No. Not the pink one. This one should be black! Oh, it only looked pink because you spilled something on it? Good. Press that button."" until he could get the news on.

Rapport, the SVT news program, has been broadcasted since *1969*. It has been aired at 19.30 for as long as I can remember. Which means that if the phone rang at 19.20-ish, I already knew who was calling.

After going through the frustrations with teaching how the remote worked (yes, we wrote actual instructions. in Times New Roman 20pt, for easier readability) the calls eventually evolved into something more...peculiar. That is what the story is actually about.

No matter how he tried, he failed to change tv channel at will. Sometimes other grand children came by, watched something and left the box set on another channel. And it was 100% certain that he was unable to change channel again.

It went to the point where he concluded that ""with this new digital stuff, you can't switch channel if you don't try to do it between the shows."" For those of you who know how DVB works, you know that this is simply not true. So when he suggested that, I knew something had to be done.

I habitually went to his place in the evening, just to ensure that the damn box wasn't playing tricks on him. I even tried the remote extensively to the point where I had to replace the batteries (so, LOTS of keypresses) and came up empty-handed.

And then it struck me. This *has* to be a user error. I kind of suspected all along, but I was unable to prove it.

Eventually I told him to show me how he did it himself.

Then I figured it out.

Granddad had been a farmer all his life. Taller than most doors, wider than some doors. He worked with his hands all of his life. Up until his body started to complain. One of the things that started to give up was his hands. He was still ridiculous strong in his hands, but as it often happens with elderly, he had trouble properly closing his hands around objects. If you had a desk clerk job, that is probably not much of a problem, because your hands are reasonably sized. Gramps hands were about the size of small dinner plate.

Holding on to a tiny remote was really, really tricky for him. He was, barely, able to grip it between thumb and middle finger. And when he pressed a button (that took the other hand, of course) the remote almost slipped out of his hand. So...obviously, he placed his index finger in front of the remote, to keep it in his hand.

Anyone who has ever seen a remote knows that you should not hold a finger in front of it. Or so I thought.

You know those universal remotes that are large as a netbook? With 1/2"" square buttons and very large printed numbers? I got him one of those. He LOVED it.",talesfromtechsupport,618,1514979108

$Grandma: Sweet old lady, not too tech savvy, know how to watch the TV channels she likes, but that’s about it.

Her TV just recently had the power supply fail and it got swapped by a local tech shop.

We just got to $Grandma’s place to drop off some groceries and my mom went into the house while I stayed in the car. After some time ~~browsing Reddit~~ doing important work she told me that something was again wrong with the TV.

&gt;$Grandma: I Hope it’s not broken again. It was just fixed! Did they do it right?

&gt;$Me:I’ll just take a look.


I go into the living room. I see nothing wrong with it. I take the remote to turn it on and the power LED starts blinking. I think: “Hmm, maybe this is an error code or something? No, it’s regular.” I then put the remote down to unplug the TV, since the screen was on, but just showing a black image. When I put it down, the blinking stopped.
Weird, huh? I checked the buttons on the remote, from top to bottom

“Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, and then... the 1 button is stuck”

So, I un-stick it... aaaaaaand (It’s gone... No) it still shows a black screen. The blinking stopped, though. And the power buttons wouldn’t do anything. I unplugged and plugged it back in and boom it came back on. 

&gt;$Me: $Grandma, it’s fixed! The 1-button was stuck. 

&gt;$Grandma: Really? That’s great! Sooo, what’s your rate for one hour?

&gt;$Me: Are you serious? There are 58 minutes left! Come on, mom, let’s go.

ditch_lily,...I've never seen anything like that,"This just happened this week. 

The week between Christmas and New Year I'm off-ish. That is, I don't go into the shop, but I'm around and available if you need me. Mrs Conroy did. She had an ""old black Singer"" she'd like to drop off for service. I set up a time to meet her, and based on her quavery old-lady voice, offered to meet her in the parking lot and carry it up for her. She declined. Lots of sewing folks have dolly bags with wheels, so I didn't think much of it.

As has been true for most of the country, it's been brutally cold here in the Great White North-the daily highs have been in the low single digits. (This morning it was -25.) This fact will become important.

I got to the shop ahead of Mrs Conroy and got everything turned on and looking like I was open for business. Right on time the elevator dinged, and she came into the shop carrying a battered Singer 66 over her arm. As she gingerly set it down on the triage table a piece fell off and Mrs Conroy quietly said something in profane French under her breath.

Me: Er... What happened?

Long story short, the machine had been sitting outside, in the unheated garage for a week or so, waiting to be loaded into the car. It's just a machine, no case, so when Mrs Conroy picked it up with her bare hands it was so cold it burned and she reflexively let go of it. It hit the concrete floor on a corner and then tipped over on its side.

The corner was broken off the bed-that was the piece that fell off when she put it down-but the bed was cracked all the way through at an angle, nearly to the pillar. The front of the head, that had likely hit the ground next, looked like it had tried to shatter but didn't quite come all the way apart. The cone bearing underneath the bed on the landing corner had sheared off at the bracket it goes through.

To Mrs Conroy's credit, she recognized that the machine was beyond my saving. She did ask if it could be welded (no; old cast iron does NOT like to be welded) but knew it was pretty much a lost cause. Fortunately, this was a thrift shop find and not sentimentally important, so she was fairly philosophical about it being junked. 

I've seen some damage, but that one takes the cake for 'worst', definitely!",talesfromtechsupport,1126,1514641324
kalesaji,How do you use a mouse?,"This has literally happend yesterday. I was visiting my grandparents, as I always do once a week to go grocery shopping with them and make sure they are alright. My grandma is fine, but my grandpa is suffering from dementia and it is taking a toll on everyone.

So we go for the shopping and my grandma wants to go to the bank afterwards to pay for medical bills and such via paper transaction. You know, the ones you fill out with a pen and put in a little bin at the bank. Sounds ancient? That's why the bank decided to change things and removed their bin for these little paper pieces. She is promptly told that she can ""comfortly do all of these transactions at home on her computer"".

I should note that she was a teacher in her professional life and never used a computer ever. When there was a formal letter to be written, she did so using a typewriter. Now I had the task to teach my 80 years old grandma how to use the computer. It had not been used much since my grandpa forgot how to - he used to be the one doing all the techy stuff in the household, but is now incapable of even using a light switch.

So we get to it: phototan registration, a smartphone app, login, how to set up a transaction, I explain all the steps in a calm and slow pace, and my grandma takes notes. She's happy that I show her how to do this new ""computer stuff"" and wants to try it later.

Later comes around and I get a call from her. She can't manage to get to the page.
I had set a shortcut on the desktop for her and all of that, so I assumed the internet was out or something the likes. It turns out she could not get to the page because she did not know how to use the mouse. Rookie mistake I made assuming the use of a mouse would be natural to someone.

$me: You are speaking with $me, how can I help you?

$Dr: Hello, my name is Dr. $Dr, I'm a prosecuting attorney here in $city, and I have a big problem. I made a screenshot and now I can't close the screenshot. 

$me: Ok, I will remote control now and try to close it.

$Dr: Don't even bother, I allready tried everything. I just want you to forward it to the 2nd Level, since it has to be resolved with a technician.

$me: Ok, maybe, but I have to look at the problem first, so I can forward the ticket with Proper Information. 

$Dr: Ok, if you really have to...

After remoting into his PC, I look at his screenshot, try to close it and lo and behold, it closes. 

$Dr: How did you do that?

$me: I pressed the X on the upper right side...?

$Dr: I tried that too but nothing happend!

$me: Can you show me?

$Dr proceeds to open the screenshot again, and trying to close the screenshot.... in the screenshot.

$me: Sir, you have to use the Upper right X.

$me shows him the upper right X  

$Dr: Well, okay... bye.



And that's how most of those pesky title owning attorney behave. They think just because THEY tried something it has to be the technician or 3rd Level Support helping them.",talesfromtechsupport,2051,1513846693
jaxmagicman,This is why everything has to be in writing,"I had two employees come to me frustrated and angry at me that a program didn't work right this morning.  They both said that they talked to me about this in the past and I was able to fix it, but it is broken again.  I honestly had not heard of the program or even the changes they had asked to be made.  They said I made the changes almost 7 years ago when I first started working.  I told them again that I don't remember, if they could just find a ticket number or email exchange I could check to see what was done.

They then went to my boss who is the president and told him how I wouldn't help them and that I am being stubborn by pretending I don't remember something.  

My boss talked to me and I told him that I honestly couldn't remember making any changes to the program, but it didn't mean that I didn't.  I just don't remember it at all.

After walking one of them through finding emails in their archive (which they had mentioned earlier that she thought emails were gone once they were archived) she found the email.

Yeah, she never sent it to me.  She sent it to the person who worked here before me.  ",talesfromtechsupport,2427,1513790815
Not_Ross_RS,"""There's only fifty of them"".","This happened a few days ago. 


For background context our company is currently going through an re-organisation, it's near to Christmas and such. Attitudes have been awful for the past few months, I could post plenty of stories but this one is still fresh in my mind.


For a bit more background context, a user had a BSOD (I believe Driver_more_less_equal) and I did the usual of checking MS Technet, updating all of the drivers, diagnostics testing. Everything appeared fine.


It happened again.


They came across around lunch time, while I was eating and essentially refused to leave until I went over and had a look. 


I went across. Same BSOD. Damn.


Rebooted the laptop, logged into the local admin account and started combing through event viewer and device manager to see if I had missed something.

**User:** There's only fifty of them. (Starts doing weird hand gestures then crosses arms like a bored child).

**Me:** ... I'm going as fast as I can. If you don't want me to do this now that's fine. But it's going to keep happening until we do something about it. 

**User:** (noises)


I continued looking through device manager, windows update and event viewer. A fair few drivers, even ones I recently re-installed were not assigned, disabled or not appearing at all.


I ran another diagnostics and hardware came back fine, no windows updates had happened since the last time I looked at it. I put the laptop on the list for a re-image suspecting windows itself was probably buggered.


I explained what was going to happen to the user, and suggest they use one of the available PCs about in the meantime. This went about as well as you can guess.


Worst lunch break so far.

&gt;$Prof: No I did not! I have also written you an email about this problem, but it hasn't been fixed! I demand that this is taken care of right away!

Obviously, I know she's lying- but I don't want to be rude. So I politely nod and say ""Yea, that Zoom button is a tricky one"". I flash a smile and start to walk away.

Now it's time for a fatality -  I say ""Oh really? Can you show me how to do that? Because I want to learn"". I pull a chair up to her desk and watch her unsuccessfully fumble through every possible menu, never even attempting to create a macro or type anything in the formula bar...

linus140,Hulk smash,"**[Timeline](https://redd.it/6v3az8) of my other stories separated by company.**

***

[This](https://redd.it/7jmvxo) story about smashing modems from u/devdevo1919 reminded of this little gem when I was a customer service representative at $SecurityCompany. Now before you say “but customer service isn’t IT”, let me explain the position. They *called* us CSRs, but what we really did was mostly technical support for the residential and small business security systems as well as some customer service functions. We had a separate team for the large businesses.

I haven’t worked there since 2015, so I’m not sure if the policy is still the same, though I doubt it changed. When someone calls in for anything we have to verify they are who they say they are. Pretty simple right? Almost every place does this. They can verify multiple ways: phone password or last four of their social security number. The caveat to the last four of their social, is that it *has* to be an owner of the account on the phone that gives us the social *and* their social has to be on our records.

The day started out pretty normal. I was in my cubicle taking the normal calls, mostly PIN resets for the keypad and people wanting to pay their bills. Pretty simple day. Until $Negan calls.

$Negan calls in with a typical problem: his keypad is beeping from a low battery and he can’t get it shut off because he forgot his four digit PIN for his keypad. So I try to go through the normal pleasantries when the call turns south real quick.

&gt; **$Me**: $SecurityCompany, $Me speaking. Can I have your name and password please?  
&gt; **$Negan**: My name is $Negan and I don’t remember my password.  
&gt; **$Me**: Well, sir, I could verify you with the last four of your social we have on record. Except we don’t don’t have one on record for you.  
&gt; **$Negan**: THAT’S BULLSHIT! THIS IS MY ACCOUNT!  
&gt; **$Me**: Sir, the only thing I can do right now is mail you out your password.  Without your password, the only thing I can do is help you power down your security system.  

Side note: We were very limited on what we could and could not do if we couldn't verify the individual.

&gt; **$Negan**: *shouting so loud now I had to move my headset away from my ear* THIS IS BULLSHIT! I DON’T KNOW MY FSCKING PASSWORD! YOUR GOD DAMN SYSTEM WON’T SHUT THE HELL UP, BUT I AM NOT TURNING IT OFF! EITHER HELP ME NOW OR I WILL RIP THIS PIECE OF SHIT OFF THE WALL AND MAIL IT BACK TO YOU!  
&gt; **$Me**: Sir, if you could please calm down, I could help you with powering it down until you receive your password so we can fix the actual issue. Also, please refrain from talking like that or I will have to terminate the call.  

I was in Army, so I’m not easily offended, and swearing doesn’t bother me. It was, like most places, company policy to terminate the call once it got hostile after at least one warning. I don’t mind if you call me for help and want to call the equipment a vulgar name, I’ve done that before and got a good laugh out of the tech on the phone.

However, once it’s directed towards me I will warn and terminate the call for multiple reasons. One being it’s been company policy at every job I’ve been at after leaving the Army. And two, you should at least be respectful to the person **you called for help**. Basic principles, but I digress.
  
&gt; **$Negan**: FSCK YOU, YOU PIECE OF TRASH!  
&gt; **$Me**: Sir, I am going to terminate this call since you can’t seem to calm down. Please call back when you have your password.  
&gt; **$Negan**: I WILL KILL -- *click*

After disconnecting the call, I put myself into break mode and go outside for a well deserved smoke break. Once I come back in, since I still had his account pulled up in our software, I see a notification from our central station on the account. I open the monitoring page and see a notification (I honestly forget what the notification was called) for all of his motion detectors, glass breaks, door sensors, and the keypad on his system being disconnected.

I also see a note from central station, this is the team that is monitoring the alarms 24/7, that they were able to contact the wife who knew the damn password. She wasn’t sure what was going on and was heading home. There was a note from central station about twenty minutes later to send out a technician to diagnose some damage done.

I checked the account two days later when the tech went out. The technician’s notes had my jaw drop. $Negan ripped every single piece of equipment we installed off the walls, door frames, etc. and threw them in a pile on the front lawn. He then proceeded to beat the equipment with a baseball bat before dowsing them in gasoline and lighting them on fire. To replace all of this would have cost $2,000 for the equipment plus $150 per hour of labor to install it all back since anything that isn't normal wear and tear is not covered under the insurance. The installation estimate was about six hours. $Negan’s wife cancelled instead.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR**: Lucille is fed and satisfied.  
**TL;DR 2**: Angry customer Hulk/Negan smashes equipment with baseball bat and lights it on fire because verification is hard.

collegetechsupportQQ,"When all online tests are invalidated, blame Mr. Robot","For once, a TFTS that has nothing to do with a user!

I manage the Linux labs at my college campus, but I also maintain the Windows and Distance Learning Center labs from time to time, especially during testing periods. During finals week, this can be incredibly frustrating, since sitting in a lab, watching students take a final is so much more boring than taking the final itself. I’m not even allowed to have a phone.

Most Finals are boring, unrestricted ones, but a few online professional certifications and placement tests are very strict in their requirements. How we set up for these tests is to boot the computer into a temporary Live OS, which does not save any settings, and automatically opens Firefox full screen in Incognito mode.

Firefox is the only thing that is allowed to run, and if the window closes, the computer reboots, resetting the OS back to defaults. If the user leaves the page set by the test taker, the browser closes. If they open a terminal or other program not allowed by that test (like a calculator) then the system is locked until a proctor (usually me) unlocks the screen.

While the professor or administrator walks around, I watch everyone’s screens, along with three security camera feeds to make sure there is no cheating. All of this is recorded, so that we can validate anything later on if we need to.

Just after the last exam, when I’m preparing to leave, the phone for the room rings. It’s my manager. The day gets progressively worse from there.


$CIO - My manager (whose initials are CIO to the actual CIO’s annoyance)
$Me - Me

$CIO: Did you add any plugins to Firefox before these tests?

$Me: No, it’s stock Firefox.

$CIO: No it’s not. There’s a plug-in called Looking Glass that’s not supposed to be there.

I check one of the computers and, sure enough, it’s there.

$Me: I didn’t install that. (Reboots computer) Its not there on boot. Looks like some kind of automatic plugin installation.

$CIO: Well (professional, very expensive certification test) was invalidated because of this plugin. They’re making everyone retake it.

(Lots of panic, stress, and fruitless research later)

$Me: looks like it was an automatic installation from Mozilla.

$CIO: Really? I want to know exactly what this plugin does. Make sure that doesn’t happen with the next exam in ten minutes.

$Me, now pissed off at everything: Gotcha. (Uninstalls Firefox, installs Chromium) (edit: and changed the name of Chromium executable to Firefox)

$CIO: I’ll get the other test sorted out. That’s my problem now.


TL;DR Firefox’s automated plugin installation invalidated a certification test, quick fix was to install Chrome.

PS: The invalidated test was un-invalidated, so yay.",talesfromtechsupport,1958,1513441938
Chipnstein,"My company's ""idiot of the decade"" award","Hello again TFTS, it's been quite a plentiful year and even though it's not yet over and there's plenty of time for greater stories yet to come, in our company, after this call, we had to award this person ""Idiot of the DECADE"" award.

One last bit of background, since my last post (few months back) I've now started IT consultancy/support at another place (which I absolutely love for the people I work with). This firm offers its services to private medical clinics only so we're dealing with doctors, PA's, nurses or secretaries.

So, usual day today, going through calls like hot butter, easy stuff like printer this, or slow computer that. And here comes the golden ticket. We shall name her *$IDA* (Idiot Decade Award). My colleague picked up but he's not an IT guy and helps a lot with calls/callbacks for us as we hate to put clients on voicemail. Another colleague was free and said, ""I can deal with her, put her through!. We shall refer to this person as *$PB* (Poor Bastard).

I won't try trouble you here with 45 (yes 45 minutes) of phone conversation of him trying to help her type in her password. Trying to also explain what ""case-sensitive"" is and such. Of course he also did a password resent and made it *Password123*. All in vain, as $IDA did not know what capital letter is, despite her 30ish years of existence on this planet.

Well, it's not exactly true to say she didn't know what capital letters are, she did, but under a different name... **CapsLock**. Going forward, we were trying to listen in as much as we could as we could physically notice whatever was left of his hair (after him pulling it like a madman) going grey. Over and over and over again, password did not unlock her computer. To note, he didn't remote to her machine as it was really unnecessary (or so we thought) and all she had to do was type in a bloody password in her Windows login, with her first name as username.

He decides she's either too dumb to do it or something truly horrific has happened, so he's got his coat and went over in person as the clinic was close by in a decent walking range. Of course, from here on out everything I can tell you is from what he relayed but this is the internet so you can only have my word for it, but how can I take his? Despite being a good trusted colleague? Well he thought if that in advance and literally took his phone out to record her attempting the following, and here the story continues:

&gt; $PB: Ok, so show me, what exactly are you doing when you try to login and it tells you password not working?
&gt; $IDA: *Types in username on PC keyboard... reaches hand to her ~~mobile~~ work extension phone to type in password*
&gt; $PB: Wait what?... Is this a joke? Am I being recorded right now?
&gt; $IDA: No, that's how I've always tried it, and it doesn't work.
&gt; $PB: *takes phone out and asks her to try it again all while she thought her issue was so serious he had to ""document it"" by filming*

For some reasons, she didn't work there long. Nothing to do with us, still a mystery to why she was let go...(not).

He did show her in the end what she was doing ""wrong"" but we just could not have believed him without that recording. I've read a lifetime load of stories on this sub but I just gotta say, this person takes the cake, the cherry, the whole goddamn bakery too.


Edit*: First off, when the post started kicking off I was at the Christmas party and we were still... shocked by the fact but having fun reading all the replies, also getting drunk and replied to some comments while half asleep in bed at 1 am. Good morning to all I suppose.

Second of all, I hope I haven't missed any typo corrections like capitol-&gt;capital letters. Thank you for all the users that pointed that out. And the edit for clarity. Had brain fart moment and don't know what possessed me to type that.

Three: no 2FA...no... trust me... she was not smart enough to know what that is. 

Last, but definitely not least, WOW, gold, the chances can't be more magical. I turned on the sound system in the house as I woke up and first thing on my playlist was Spandau Ballet - Gold, then I saw it, thought I was still asleep. Thank you Anon, but please would you reveal to us poor souls, who you are when you ring the office!!

visavillem,Server whisperer - It's getting hot in here,"Background: about a decade in IT support - networks, hardware, software. I have worked for different companies that provide IT support to other companies.

Disclosure: English is not my first language, so there probably are mistakes. If the mistakes bother you, please point them out, I will try to correct them.

The Client built themselves a new office. They also built a dedicated server room in the core of the building. The room was rectangular, the shortest side was wide enough for two rack cabinets side by side, but barely enough room to get behind them (I'm a big guy, but when I sucked my stomach in I was able to get behind the rack cabinets), the long side was maybe a 5 meters (about 16 feet for our American friends) long, the height was about 3 meters (10 feet). The room had one AC unit (it was enough when it worked) and an air moisturizer (apparently to prevent static build-up, I don't know if it had any effect), that made the room smell like burning rubber. The ventilation was really bad, they later drilled a hole through the ceiling, that helped a little.

At the time the client had 4 servers - A file server, Mail server, test server for their database system  and a server for the telephone system. All were physical servers, because virtualization was not really a thing yet. There were also some switches and couple of UPS'es.

First time we noticed that something was wrong, when the monitoring alerts notified us that the servers were down. I went to the site to check it out. I  could hear the fans from the first floor. The fireproof door of the server room was warm. When I opened the door a gust of hot air hit me. The ambient temperature was 45 C (113 F for our American friends), I can't imagine how hot the processors were. And one of the servers was still running! The others had passed out from the heat. I checked the AC unit - it was off. Like no power, pressing the buttons on the remote or on the unit did nothing. 

I left the server room door open and went to the fuse box, and found one of the breakers in the off position. Conveniently the schematics of the box were right there - yep, it was the fuse for the AC unit. Turned it on and the AC unit started working. Once the server room temperature was low enough, I restarted all the servers.

I reported this incident to the client and recommended that an electrician and the HVAC guys check the equipment, because this didn't seem normal.

The same thing happened two weeks later. And then again 3 weeks later. 

The last time it happened on Christmas eve, but guess who was on call? Yep, yours truly. 

I was about 150 km (about 100 miles for our American friends) out of the city visiting my mum. Got my first speeding ticket trying to get back to the clients site as fast as possible (""my servers are on fire"" was not a good enough excuse for the police).

That was it. I told the client that I refuse to take the responsibility for their servers until they fix the damn AC unit. So they (finally) called a HVAC guy in. It turned out that whoever installed the unit managed to connect the fan wrong way, so when the unit was powered on the fan drew more current than it was supposed to and sometimes tripped the breaker. Once the fan was connected correctly, the problem disappeared.

Somehow we didn't lose any servers or even a single hard disk…

TL;DR - **$me** - ""But officer, my servers are literally on fire!""; **$Police** - ""Are they celebrating the Christmas too?""

evilfish2000,"Mom lost points on her ""she-knows-IT"" meter.","I didn't expect this would happen to me but it actually did.

So this happened yesterday. I'm sitting at work, coding along with bliss and music in my headphones when my cell started to ring and I could see that it was my mother.

Now my mother is actually quite good at IT. It has been a learning process but, I always wanted to try to teach her something from an issue that I tried to fix if I deemed it within reason. Stuff like: ""If the computer says insert disk 2, then insert disk 2"" and progressed from there. And she has learned. At one time I had to visit her because she wanted to transfer video from old VHS tape to her computer and was actually damn close in doing it herself, she just misread a manual and got a wrong component that could not convert the signal correctly. So whenever she calls I start to assume that she at least have tried herself until she felt she could progress no further or had a good idea about the issue.

With that in mind, I answer the call.

&gt; Me: Hi mom, whats up?

&gt; Mom: Hi, I need to sort this screen cable issue out!

I have recently exchanged my moms big desktop with a small NUC PC and she loves it. Problem is that the only screen outputs are DisplayPort and mini HDMI, but she doesn't want to replace her old screens so I had to come up with DisplayPort to HDMI cable for the first screen, but we never got around to the second. And at this point, I forgot what interfaces the screen had.

&gt; Me: Ahh okay, so the first cable is a DisplayPort to HDMI?

&gt; Mom: You mean the almost square plug to the wide narrow one? Yes.

&gt; Me (Impressed): Ahh good, and do you know what the other output on the NUC is?

&gt; Mom: Yes, it is Mini HDMI.

(Told ya, she is not that lost)

&gt; Me (still impressed): Nice, If you look at the other screen, can you tell me which interfaces that one have?

&gt; Mom: No, I can't.

&gt; Me: Okay, can you take a picture with your phone?

&gt; Mom: No, I can't.

&gt; Me: But You are calling from it!?

&gt; Mom: I am at work, not home!

&gt; Me: FFS MOM!!!

Cue me explaining how it was impossible for me to troubleshoot without information and that she just lost 150 points on my mother-knows-IT meter.

kestreldreams,Better than you,"Background, I do over the phone tech support for a major tech company. Most of my customers are amazing and I give great service to, however this guy was a piece of work.

Call gets escalated to me for a very simple issue I fix in less than 5 minutes. Literally just an issue on how to create a folder, you hit the plus sign and name it, that simple.

Customer then goes into a long rambling detailed issue that he wants fixed. I tell him what I would do to fix the issue, giving him the full details before we get started.

AH will be A$$hat

AH: No. I will not do that, it’s takes hours to do! Do you know how much I make?? I make way more in an hour than you ever will!

Me: I understand your time is valuable, and this process is a bit time consuming. However it typically takes between 40 min and 1 hour, and I can walk you through it step by step.

AH: no! I’m not doing that!  You people don’t know what you are talking about! I’m in finance and I know more about Tech Support than you do!

This continues for several minutes where I try and explain the reason why I suggested the method I did, what it will actually do, and my own qualifications.

AH: oh! So you’re the ONE rep at () that can magically fix this! 

Note: Ok never said that. Never even implied it. Eventually I just shut down.

Me: ok. Well it sounds like you have this issue well in hand. What can I do for you?

AH: you can fix this!

Me: I’ve told you how I would fix your issue, sir, however since you do not want to go through those steps, we will be unable to continue on that issue. How may I help you today?

not the most professional question to ask at that point, but a trick I rarely have to use with those types.

AH: My issue right now is this problem. Fix it! Do YOU want to be the issue?! Do YOU want to be the issue?! Who are you to tell me what to do??

Me: You’re right, I’m nothing. Since you do not wish to do the troubleshooting to fix the issue; and since you have a great deal of technical knowledge as you’ve mentioned, it sounds like you have that issue well in hand. How else may I help you today?

Somehow AH just didn’t seem happy he couldn’t get me to grovel before his wealth and mighty tech wisdom. Wonder why...

YukitoBurrito,"""what do you mean by transactions?""","I swear, those who use quickbooks are often the least qualified to use a computer. So, customer has a ten year old acer die on her. We already replaced the HDD once, the DVD drive once, and it's burned through the second HDD. I convinced her to stop trying to keep it alive.

We transferred her 2012 quickbooks to a newish laptop, and everything goes well. I show her how to back up, and write down instructions on how to do so.

 I get a call at 9 am on my personal cell on my day off (already mad from that) to help her with putting quickbooks on her husbands laptop. 

CX:""I used the instructions you wrote to put it on his computer""

me: No, I have you backup instructions.

cx: Yeah.

me internally: does backup have some new meaning.....?

So, we do remote via teamviewer and somehow she has her desktop plastered with no less than six different copies of....not the current quickbooks file, but one from 2014. I look in the flash drive, and somehow there is not only the current backup I did, but another half dozen more than the one fresh backup I did, with timestamps for yesterday.

I delete all the ones on the desktop, and get ready to restore the most recent backup and ask ""ok, have you had any transactions since the other day?""

I am met with a bewildered silence, as if I asked her the airspeed velocity of an unlaiden swallow. 

cx:""What do you mean, ""transactions?""

Beyond frustrated at this point, I tell her that the word ""transactions"" does not have a secondary meaning. I restored the most recent one, found out she had somehow once again backed up the 2014 files 6x on the usb drive. I delete all of these, clear out the recent used list in quickbooks to keep her from trying to use the 2014 files, and reload the last good backup we did. If there are any different transactions at this point she's the only one who knows where they went.

I work as a helpdesk kind of guy at people's homes. If you have a problem with your computer or printer or something, you call me and I come to your house to fix it. The ideal side job for an IT student.

Last week I was installing Windows 10 at a woman's computer. She (50 years old) mentioned her mom (75 years old) had a slow laptop and wanted me to also look into that. To prepare for that, she called her mom to get some information about the laptop (I don't need that to fix her laptop and mentioned that, but she wanted to do it anyway, so whatever).
Her mom could not send her a picture of the laptop, since she had an old fashioned cellphone. Instead she had to just read out all information on the laptop, so her daughter could write it down and give it to me.

I said it was mostly useful to get the brand and the model, and said that on the top of the laptop the brand was probably written. The daughter asks this and repeats after her mom: ""On the top it says s-n-s-v"". My brain starts spinning. I don't know all laptop brands, but I'm pretty sure I know about 90-95% of what is normally bought. But I have never heard of a snsv brand.

Atticus_of_Finch,How IT got a server room,"Gather 'round young ones while I tell you a tale.  This hearkens back to the days when dial-up Internet was your only option, home computers were sold in cow-themed boxes, and Computer Shopper was a magazine so thick it could be used for home defense.

A little background to get us started.  Shortly after I started in IT in 1993, our department was moved from inside the hospital to a building about 2 blocks away.  It was to be a temporary move (HA!) that would only last 18 months.  Eight years later, we moved back inside the hospital.  Here is our story of how that happened.  

It was a known complaint that we needed to be inside the hospital, since that is where all of the users were.  But here we were, walking 2 blocks in the wind, rain, snow, and ice to service printers, replace dumb terminals, and troubleshoot network issues.  At the time, 95% of our system was a mainframe in another city, and we were just client devices off of the mainframe.  We had a few small 3-5 user Novell networks, but nothing too big.  

As time passed, we started seeing more and more PCs rather than dumb terminals.  Finally, a decison was made that we needed to consolidate the growing Novell networks into one system.  As 250-user single server. I was now working days, and was made our site admin for this project, and would be given all the training I could handle.  Our main financial and patient systems were still mainframe, but we used terminal emulation software on the PCs to access these.  

Two things led to our move back to the hospital.  The first was by design.  My design, from my dark evil lair.  

We were migrating to a new M$ Office suite.  As part of this, we required that *everyone* go through training since we would be moving from text-based mainframe email to $Lookout email.  We spend 6 months running all of the staff through classes in our crappy building.  Heat and cooling were inadequate in our building due to the age, and the fact that it was chopped up and walls moved with no planning for HVAC zones.  I had complained multiple times to our administration, but we were not a priority.  Since we weren't, they weren't.  I planned them last in the migration to the new office suite.  I scheduled them for 2-hour afternoon class.  In August.  In a training room that faced the west side of the building.  Temperatures on the desktop in that room consistently reached around 100-105 degrees by 2:00.  

When the class was over, and our senior leadership team was drenched in sweat, and had a whole new understanding of our complaints about the building.  Yes, I am evil.  I know this, and now they do.  I also scheduled them for various classes in the same room for morning in the winter months.  You could *almost* see your breath in the room.  Too bad they coudl not type with their gloves one.  

The final event that helped us move back into the main building was out of our control, but we made some sweet lemonade out of lemons.  Since this was an old building, and we were leasing space, we did not have generator power in this building.  We relied on UPS units to maintain power on our file servers that housed our local applications, including our terminal emulation software.  Payroll was run every two weeks on a Monday.  Payroll was managed on the mainframe which required terminal emulation software.  Power company had a multiple zone power outage that just so happened to land on a Monday.  A payroll Monday.  

I watched as the last LED on the UPS for the file server slowly faded away.  It was dark in the room where the servers were.  It was also eerily quiet.  Then the phone rings.  Payroll clerks were complaining.  Sorry, out of my control.  Executives call:  What can we do?  Buy a time machine, go back, and listen when we said that this was a setup doomed to failure?  Best advice I coudl give was to stick payroll staff in any office in the hospital where someone was on vacation and hope for fast data entry.  

The next week, it was announced that we would start renovating an area for a server room in the main hospital that included generator power.

Zeewulfeh,More from Aviation Maintenance: Copypasta,"*[Behold!  I went and made a chronological ordering of these!](https://redd.it/7i0esb)*

***

One of the downsides to the civilian aviation industry at a Large $AviationCompany is seniority.  Being towards the bottom of the totem pole meant I was on third shift, working from 2100 to 0700, on a rotating on/off schedule that was almost impossible to follow.  Average seniority to *get* day shift in my department—Intermediate Maintenance (IMX)--was a 1984 start-date…and I had started in 2010.  

Naturally, when an opportunity to work Day Shift, 8 hours a day, Monday-Friday for three months arose, I jumped at it.  None of the high-seniority guys wanted it, so a small group of us low-seniority mechanics found ourselves with a rather sweet gig doing what were called “Reliability Visits.”  (A Reliability Visit is basically a routine visit where we take care of or modify systems with reliability issues.)  And for three months, it was an excellent time of learning, hanging out and actually having a normal life for the first time in years.  Only downside was when someone stole my VivoTab from my bag in the locker room, but $AviationCompany kindly replaced it with a brand new Surface after I’d reported it stolen.

In the last month of the project, a trio of positions were announced in the Continuous Improvement Group for two Maintenance Planners and one Improvement Guru.  We would remain part of our department, just seconded to this special group for an indefinite duration of time and could, at any time, return to the floor.  It would be a day shift assignment, 10 hour days, 4 days a week…which sounded absolutely wonderful.   I decided to go ahead and apply for the Improvement side—I’d just finished my business degree the year prior—and was selected for an interview.  On the day of said interview, my interviewer (a lead from my department who had disappeared into this group a year prior) asked me which position I was applying for, and if I was interested in the planning roles once I’d told him I was looking for the Continuous Improvement guru—which I said I was, on a lark.

About a week later, I receive a call—my old lead informed me he’d selected me for a planner position, effective almost immediately.  Over the next week I was issued my ~~leash~~ company phone, wifi hotspot and laptop and began working upstairs.  I found out I’d be working with a High Profile Customer ($HPC) on our Maintenance Repair Organization (MRO) side of the operation planning the checks for their aircraft.  It was pretty exciting, all in all, as I would be wearing normal street clothes, would be working daytime hours, still had three-day weekends, and could actually work from home if necessary.  And if I ever got sick of it, I could head back to the floor and resume holding a wrench, which I likely would after a year or two of holding down a desk.  In the meantime, I would enjoy being a part of my organization’s leadership team.

Within a few days of my moving upstairs, I was also notified that I’d been chosen for Employee of the Quarter on the behalf of the entirety of Base and Intermediate Maintenance (IMX) and was sent to The Mothership for an award, pictures, and lunch.  My name would be engraved on a little marker and attached to the giant plaque in the hallways outside our hangars, and I was told to take my wife out for dinner and submit the receipt.  (We ended up going to a *very* nice and none-too-cheap steak house…)
***

The email came suddenly and very unexpectedly in the late afternoon during my third week upstairs.  Our facility director was notified only a few hours before, but the rest of us in the leadership team were completely taken by surprise.  The announcement was simple and straightforward:

&gt;EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY: Intermediate Maintenance will now fall under the umbrella of Line Maintenance and become separate from Base Maintenance.

There were three of us upstairs from IMX (the lead, myself, and one other guy) and our first question the very next day was our own fate in this sudden ‘schism’ we were caught up in.  Our boss offered us a choice: We could immediately return to IMX, the floor, and our normal schedules….Or we could continue working in the Continuous Improvement group as planners and the lead.  I thought hard, saw that bridge burning away, and decided not to cross back home.  The three of us were formally Exiled from IMX and shuffled over to Base Maintenance (BMX) Administration.

Since my Employee of the Quarter award was for IMX and came so close to the Schism, the plaque was never updated for that quarter and as far as most leadership is concerned never happened.
***

I settled into my new role quickly, and was introduced to a new [Very Special Mod]( https://redd.it/77fdb6).  Yes, you see that correctly.  The VSW I (very poorly explained) have found myself coming back to every so often for the past two years.  This was, however, my very first introduction to it.  

When an aircraft receives a standard modification, it is performed using a ‘Service Bulletin.’  (SB)  The SB is basically the description of the modification, the instructions to perform it, and any testing and other pertinent information required by maintenance.  My lead passed me the four service bulletins required by this modification and told me to study up on it and get with the Head Inspector about any changes he sees that need to be made to the paperwork—this mod was not yet FAA approved for this aircraft type, so it was still in the engineering phase and we could request changes to the paperwork easily.  

I read through them the first time and died a little inside.  The instructions were almost literally “Install Modification Piece per drawings” for each step.

It was obviously unacceptable.  I got with the Head Inspector and we re-wrote the engineer’s instructions to be clear and step-by-step complete with signature blocks for mechanic and inspection accountability, emailed them to him and got him to change them entirely.  And then we did the same for the testing instructions.  It took a couple of weeks, but when $HPC showed up with their first plane, we were ready to go...

…at least, we thought we were.

***

It was a minor detail, really, as far as the engineer was concerned.  In fact, he didn’t see why we were having any issues with the drawings at all.  $HPC’s Aircraft, a Model-X, used the same exact fuselage tube as a Model-Y.  The mod had been done successfully on the Model-Y aircraft, and since the difference is mostly that a Model-Y has two more engines than a Model-X, it shouldn’t be a big deal to copy/paste the same exact installation templates.  Obviously we were doing something wrong if the frames and aircraft structure weren’t lining up with the drawings.  

Thankfully, the engineering firm had sent the engineer out for on-site support for this first-of-type install and we were able to drag him onto the plane to look at things.  Of course, while boarding the aircraft he didn’t pay any attention to where he was stepping and put his foot through an open floor panel and the ductwork below, wrecking the duct.  After making sure he was fine, we lead him to the installation site for the majority of the modification equipment, where he very swiftly learned that while yes, the fuselage tubes are the same in measurement, they aren’t the same in internal structure.  

While he was being led back out of the plane, one of the techs installing the wiring runs and auxiliary mod equipment pulled him aside to ask an important question.

&gt;**Installer** Hey, you’ve got the wires running down the overhead ceiling area on the right side of the aircraft.  We can’t put it there.  Can we move all of this to the left side of the aircraft?”  

The installer pointed up, and it was immediately apparent to all but the engineer what the issue was.

&gt;**Engineer**  Can’t you just move that duct over to the other side and get it out of the way?  We never had this issue on the Model-Y.

Frankly, I’m surprised the engineer didn’t just burst into flames right there from the looks he was getting.  Allow me to explain—Down the right side of centerline ran the air conditioning ductwork for the interior of the plane as well as all the supporting structure.  The left side had the majority of the wiring runs because there was no equipment installed on that side and in the way.  On the Model-Y aircraft, this is actually reversed—yet another instance of copy/paste instead of actually looking at the aircraft they were modding.  

Using small words, we explained the issue with modifying the system to appease him and eventually, he understood.  We escorted him back to his hole and eventually gave us new drawings to fix his mess. 

Later on, at the very end of the visit Engineer was left unsupervised in the aircraft while the testing crew was up front.  Deciding he was getting hot, he took it upon himself to open an aircraft door.  Thankfully the slide was disarmed, however it was a very windy day…and was caught by the wind immediately and ripped fully open, leaving the now wrecked shroud he’d attempted to grab in his hand.  He made up a story, was caught in the lie and was asked to leave and never ever set foot in our facility again.  

***
During the visit, I was called by the lead running the $HPC aircraft visit who was looking for a specific drawing for the mod.  I did a bit of research and soon discovered exactly what drawing he’d asked for…

It was for this mod, specific to Type DCCLXVII aircraft, produced by the competitor of the manufacturer of the Model X and Y aircraft.  Once again, his copy/paste habit had struck.  I would eventually learn it was part of the Engineering Firm’s culture—they burned through engineers so quickly that there was no one expert on the mod they were issuing, so I’ve been finding copypasta from competing aircraft manufacturer versions of the mod for the past two years. 

TL;DR: The grass isn’t greener on the other side, just better lit.

zibeb,Ticket resolution: Play more Minesweeper.,"We have a somewhat elderly lady working in Customer Service, where data entry is a large part of her job. As part of record entry of new customer orders, she has to click a button on the toolbar to attach documents to the order. However, near that button on the toolbar, there is another button that looks similar, called ""Document Lifecycle."" That button opens up a new form, which searches the entire system for related records to the customer order. It works great when you're showing off a demo system with 200 customer orders, and less so when you have an actual live production system with millions of records to search each time the button is pressed. Each time you click this button, the program locks up for about 10 minutes while it goes looking.

New Ticket: *Life Cycle icon*

Description:
&gt; Could you please lose the icon or make it  inaccessible on my computer.  I've clicked on that darn thing in error twice and it's a nightmare!  I don't think I will ever use it except in error!

When the ticket came in, I went looking to see if the vendor had updated the form to make things run any faster. I did find some updates, but they only resulted in about a 10% improvement. The button in question is actually bound to the form, and isn't just something you can turn off in settings. So I installed the patches, and closed the ticket.

Solution:
&gt; We've installed some patches to get to the latest version of this form, and while we have seen a quantifiable improvement in speed, we're still having performance issues. There's another update coming later that should continue to work on this issue, but it's going to be wrapped into a service pack and is not yet available to us. Once that service pack releases, we will be pushing to get it implemented.

&gt;Unfortunately, we are unable to remove the button for the Lifecycle form.

About an hour, I get an email response:
&gt; Well, that’s too bad.  
Could you train me not to hit it in error??

I... really didn't know how to respond to that. I considered a number of things, sending back a screenshot of the button with a big arrow next to it that says ""DON'T CLICK THIS."" I considered the more BOFH approach of just increasing keyboard voltage any time the button was pressed unintentionally. 

Finally though, I realized that there was a training program for exactly this, built into Windows.

&gt; In all seriousness, just slow down. When we do repetitive tasks, sometimes muscle memory takes over and it becomes easy to not look closely at what you’re clicking on. (Kinda like distracted driving.)

&gt; Not a joke, I actually recommend playing minesweeper on your computer at home. Minesweeper and Solitaire were added to windows back in the 3.1 days, to train mouse discipline without the users even realizing they were learning. Solitaire was added to teach users how to Drag and Drop, Minesweeper taught using the right/left mouse buttons and mouse precision/control.

That's gotta be the first time I've closed a ticket by recommending the user play Minesweeper.",talesfromtechsupport,2317,1512589868

SuperSaltySailorX,One of the few times my job actually felt worth while.,"So I work front line tech support for a rural Canada ISP.
So get all the usual problems that are a single Google search way from being answered.

Now we don't offer support for routers. Basically turn it off and on and if that doesn't work call the router manufacturers support line. 

But we are allowed to provide best effort support if we choose to. 

Depending on the situation I'll help sometimes, if I feel like they won't have a hard time doing it.


So that being said, this is the story of one of the few times I've offered router support and actually felt good about it.


$me - front line tech
$cust - sweetest old lady trying to setup a router.
$int - internal thoughts, 


$me "" Hi you've reached tech support how can I help you?""
$cust "" well I just bought a new router and can't set it up""

$int "" nope, not today. Old person  + new router = alcoholism for me""

$me "" we don't really support routers, it's not our equipment so,  Blah blah blah blah blah""

$cust "" oh well the last agent there told me I had to buy a new router because mine was broke""

$int "" great, someone blamed the router like an asshole""

$me "" well I guess in that case even though we don't technically support it I can give it my best effort""

$cust ""oh thank you""

$me "" so what part of the setup are you having issues with?""

$cust ""well I hooked it all up like the old one but it doesn't work""

$int ""Jesus someone actually made an attempt to make it work before calling""

So it's at this point I start troubleshooting the connection to make sure the internet I working at the modem at least. 

Of course it's not it's never that easy with old people and routers.

It's also at this point I realise they are on a legacy system that is:

-Very old
- Really shit
- impossible to troubleshoot
- and has less than 1000 people using across the entire country try so I'm quite unfimiliar with it.

About 20 mins of rebooting the modem and fumbling with the horrible tools for this system.

It comes online and is connected to the internet.

$me ""alright signal looks good, let's get the router setup""

$cust "" I have this setup CD, should I try that?""

$me ""yeah sure, put it in and let me know when something pops up on the screen""


......

$cust ""nothing happened""

$me "" let's just open it manually""

20 mins of teaching grandma how to get to my computer and to double click on the CD drive

$cust "" ok it has a bunch of files""

$int of the course the auto run doesn't work. Why would it. It's an old lady, everything must go wrong. 

$me "" do you see something that says setup?""

$cust ""yup""

$me "" oh awesome double click that and it'll start the setup'

....

$cust "" there's just more files""

$me ""..... Do any of them say setup?""

$cust "" yup""

$me "" can you double click on it?""

$cust ""oh the setup popped up!""


Next we spend 20 mins of her ready everything on the screen and me telling her to click next repeatly 

$cust ""ssid?""

$me "" oh that's the name of your wifi, you can change it or leave it""

$cust ""oh ok""

Clicks next

$cust "" oh I actually want to change the name to what the old one was""

Clicks back button

$cust "" it says if I go back I'll have to start all over""

$me ""oh well you can just do that yourself later when you-""

Clicks back.

$int "" I could just burn the building down""

And then we spend another 20 mins doing the router setup again. 

About an hour into the call at this point, supervisors are asking what's going on. Managers are asking if they can help.

We finally get it setup.

We test the wifi on the iPad.

Shits works first try.

$me "" well awesome, glad we got that hooked up was there anything else I could help with?""

$cust "" well let me just test one more thing""

$int ""please for the love of God just let whatever this person it going to do just work""

Hear odd ringing in the background.

Cust starts talking to someone clearly over FaceTime or Skype or something.

Speak with her daughter and grandkids.

Might have been a 30 second call, they were about to eat so cust said she'll call back later.

It was what the customer said next that honestly made me feel like a hero.

$cust "" oh thank you so much! I can't thank you enough that was the first time I've seen my grandkids in 3 months""


One of the few times, I've genuinely felt like my job matter.

The system I inherited (classic ASP, MS Access) was in a pretty bad state when I started here, so a lot of my co-workers (who do the actual work that keeps the company running) are used to search for solutions by thinking out of the box. This is a rather short one when we were having some issues with a RaspberryPi/HDMI-screen/IP-cam combination.  

Basically what would happen at random intervals, was that the raspberry pi would reboot, with some environment variables changing, and then after booting up the screen would display upside down. I spent some time trying to fix this issue, but failed at doing so. Following conversation occurred right when I came in on a monday morning. *Edit: rephrased this sentence a bit because the original sounded negative. My co-workers never bug me before I'm at my desk with coffee etc, unless everything has broken down*

&gt;**$co-worker**: About that raspberry pi..  
&gt;**$me**: Yeah I don't know what causes the issue, but I can look into it a bit more after lunch today  
&gt;**$co-worker**: Oh, you don't have to. We just turned the screen upside down to fix it.

The screen was mounted to a sort of stand and it was easy for them to flip the screen upside down. This fixed the whole issue. My settings were overwritten on reboot somehow and the Pi would flip the screen. They just turned the screen 180 degrees, so that the whole issue with settings was gone.",talesfromtechsupport,691,1512383508
visavillem,"Server whisperer - RAID5, 2 disks offline, no backups - how fsck-ed are you?","Background: about a decade in IT support - networks, hardware, software. I have worked for different companies that provide IT support to other companies.

Disclosure: English is not my first language, so there probably are mistakes. If the mistakes bother you, please point them out, I will try to correct them.

It was a nice Friday morning, I had just had my first coffee when a call came in - the Client was unable to send e-mails. Remote troubleshooting showed that the server was down, so I was dispatched to the site.

First look at the server and my heart sank - two disks (out of four) had the fault LED on. I quickly called my office to find out where the backups are. There were none.

The client was fairly new and we were still in the process of handover from the previous support company. It turned out they never got the tape drive working and we were just starting to implement a new backup process. A new tape drive was ordered and it arrived the same day, ironically.

The clients contact person probably saw the despair in my face and asked how fsck-ed they were (she actually used the F-bomb). Well, take a guess. The RAID array was level 5, so 2 failed disks usually means a total loss of the data. And they ran everything on that server - e-mails, file shares, directory services, accounting software. I told her not to get the hopes up, but I will do everything I can to get their data back. But also they can all go home, because it's going to take at least the weekend.

I hauled the server to my office and started with the recovery process. 

First things first. I connected the disks to our backup system (a PC we used to back up clients disks before wipe or clean install). We had a recovery software that was able to recognize the RAID structure and I was able to recover most of the data (some files were corrupted, naturally). It was at that point I realized that one of the failed disks was still accessible. Now I had to figure out how to repair the RAID. I had recovered most of the data, but wouldn't it be cool to get the server working again, instead of rebuilding the whole infrastructure? And with the rebuild I would have to wipe the disks anyway, so I could not make the situation worse than it already was.

I stuck the disks back into the server and started the RAID configuration utility. It showed 2 disks as normal, one disk failed and one disk offline. The built-in utility was useless, there was no option to tell the controller to take the disk online again. 

After practicing some Google-fu I found a bootable image of the more advanced RAID utility (funny thing was - the server was HP, the utility was from IBM, but it was able to manage the controller just fine, because the RAID controller was from the same manufacturer). So using that utility I managed to convince the controller to take the disk back online and crossing the fingers I rebooted the server. And it booted. The operating system complained that the previous shutdown was not clean, but after checking the disk it started without further issues. 

The e-mail database was corrupted (it was expected), so I spent a few hours running the e-mail database repair tool, after that the e-mail server started working again.

The server didn't leave my sight until the RAID was resynced, the new tape drive installed and the first full backup finished.

The whole process took 2 days, but in the end everything worked. Later they found a few corrupted files on the file shares and a few broken e-mails on the e-mail server, but it was nothing compared to the total loss of the data.

I wasn't entirely sure why the second drive went offline. My theory was that it got depressed by the death of its neighbour.

TL;DR - Have you backed up your data recently?

No? Go and back up your data NOW!

Yes? Have you checked the backup recently? No? Go and check your backups NOW!

Seb_1111,"""Yeah I deleted it and now I can't connect, what did you break?""","FTP://LTL

Posting on mobile so please forgive any formatting errors and/or typos.

Background: I host a $Server for $program. Following some issues with $plugin for $submodule, I made the announcement on $LargeUnharmonicChatApplication that we were going to remove $plugin. $program requires essentially a 100% match between the server and client configuration to connect successfully.


$clueless - friend of mine, usually reasonably tech savvy but apparently cannot follow instructions.

$me - if you don't get this one by now then I can't help unfortunately.


I get a message from $clueless:
&gt; $clueless: Hey I can't connect to $Server it says my configuration doesn't match the one on the server.


&gt; $me: Yeah we removed $plugin, so you need to remove it from $pluginsdir


&gt; $clueless: Yeah I've done that, I saw your message, you must have done something wrong.


&gt; $me: I don't think so, because everyone else is having no issues. Let me check the logs.

I check the log file, and it's showing a version mismatch in $submodule. Odd.

&gt; $me: Hey, $clueless, what EXACTLY did you do?


&gt; $clueless: Exactly as you said to in your post. I removed $submodule and the whole $pluginsdir because we were having issues.


&gt; $me: Sorry, you removed $submodule?


&gt; $clueless: Well, yeah...


&gt; $me: And the error message from the server says there's a version mismatch on $submodule for you, too?
 

It was at this point, I think, that it dawned on poor $clueless.

&gt; $clueless: Oh.


&gt; $clueless: OH.


&gt; $clueless: I was just supposed to remove $plugin, wasn't I.


&gt; $me: Yep.


&gt; $clueless: You could have made it a bit clearer.

The message literally said ""PSA: Following issues with the $plugin for $submodule we're removing it from the server. You'll have to do the same on your clients. Just go into the $pluginsdir folder and remove the $plugin file.""

And that, dear readers, is how I ended up making an application to automate the changes to the client, because users are clearly unable of doing even such simple tasks as deleting files.",talesfromtechsupport,1055,1512334174
gargravarr2112,Try asking next time - that stuff was there for a reason!,"So I have a new starter on Monday. He's requested an Ubuntu desktop so, on Tuesday with nothing else to do, I set one up for him. This was a few days after our seemingly monthly desk reshuffle. This gives the team he's joining the necessary space to accommodate him.

As a result of the desk move, screens are now in very random places as we have some empty desks. After moving the stragglers into place, I grab the first new screen in my pile. Well, technically not the first - we have a single spare 32"" 4k screen. They've become a bit desirable since the standard 34"" curved monitors are much lower resolution (3440x1440 irrc). As the 4k screen has been used for events and such, it's been in and out of its box so many times the cardboard padding is ruined so I'm keen to put it into service, so I allocate it to the new guy and put it on his desk.

Come Friday afternoon, I receive an instant message from the head of the team the new guy will be joining:

&gt;$teamlead: hey, you know $otherdev is stealing the screen you set aside for $newguy?

I spin around and sure enough, $otherdev is carrying his curved monitor back to $newguy's desk. Astonished, I walk over there as he sets the monitor down.

Amusingly, my BOfH-wannabe attitude appears to be working. No sooner do I approach than another member of the team hands me a Nerf gun...

Sure enough, the computer that I rigged up days in advance has been completely unplugged. I am very annoyed and tell $otherdev to get lost (with persuasion from the Nerf gun...). He's made no effort to switch any cables over and instead was going to leave the screen on the desk unconnected. After getting rid of him, I set the machine up again.

Now, I have no specific objections to people swapping monitors around - I have also traded my curved for a 4k so it would be hypocritical to say no. Although I like to play the BOfH, I don't want to look like I'm an obstruction or give management any reason to impose limits on my authority. The company is still very small and people managed their own hardware before I joined, but I've been there 3 months now. However, interfering with my setups without asking is a big no-no in my book. I pre-built the new guy's machine in case I can't get in on time on Monday morning (buses are unreliable around here and many others have trouble).

After reassembling the machine, I ask $otherdev why he took it upon himself to do this without asking me. I'm slightly floored by his answer.

&gt;$otherdev: it didn't look like the screen was in use, so I just took it.

&gt;$me: and you didn't think to ask *any of the surrounding people* if the desk was set up for anyone, say for **Monday morning**??

&gt;$otherdev: &lt;no answer&gt;

I was able to end with some BOfH-ness though, some karma :) While I'm digging through my cable boxes to set the screen up (again), $otherdev walks over rather meekly.

&gt;$otherdev: so I was using HDMI... and HDMI only supports a 30Hz refresh rate at 4k... so...

&gt;$me: oh, you mean you need one of these USB-C to DisplayPort cables? &lt;holds one up&gt;

&gt;$me: &lt;immediately shuts and locks the cupboard and walks away&gt;

$ITwannabe: The IT guru. Though how much he actually did in IT and programming, I never found out. Was not much, that I can tell.
________________

After the whole debacle of the last part, I try my best to salvage what I can. I use the next two weeks to read into everything I can relating to Access and server issues. I get the bright idea to move the database to Sharepoint in hopes of having a better data connection; it also actually works! Problem is, since we only have Sharepoint 2011 (or something, not too sure about it anymore) and should have upgraded to Sharepoint 2016 about a month ago, it completely destroys all the links and correlations made in the DB itself. So no more linked tables, but just plain tables. Can't work with that, sadly.

I do not hear from $boss anymore which makes me quite nervous. She just comes in from time to time to ask how I am doing, I tell her that I am working on a solution though I have no idea how to make the app running world wide, she nods and goes on her merry way.

A few days later, I have a meeting with $bigBoss. We talk, I explain what went wrong, he just says that he has no idea what I am talking about anyway and that I just should keep on trying. (He was really sympathetic about it, telling me not to worry since I seemingly am in over my head and that technically it is the fault of $boss for hiring someone not suited for the job.)

While I go through the corridors to get me some more coffee, one day I spy $ITwannabe in a room. With a video camera. And a lot of people. And some billboards which have his project name printed on them. Next time I meet him, I ask what this is all about and he tells me:

&gt; $ITwannabe: Oh, we were just doing some demonstration tapes for our cloud solution.

So much for having no time for me. He has enough time to make some f-ing videos, for Pete's sake.

So, finally, I give up. I cannot make this Access app work world wide, no chance in hell - at least not in this last month I am with $company, and no way in same hell I will keep working here, not after failing that much and having to work around obstacles constantly.

I finally meet $ITwannabe in a good mood and try for some last hitch to get my car on the road.

&gt; $win4free: Hey $ITwannabe! May I have some of your time?

&gt; $ITwannabe: Sure, spill it.

&gt; $win4free: Guess you heard about my project having failed?

&gt; $ITwannabe: (with an evil smile) Told you not to work with $boss.

&gt; $win4free: Not that I had any say in that matter. Anyway, any idea how I can salvage that shit?

And this is the point where $ITwannabe became my secret hero. Still do not like him to this day, really, but damn...

&gt; $ITwannabe: Easy. Just say it is a prototype.

&gt; $win4free: ... what?

&gt; $ITwannabe: See, it's like this: You made a mess, and no wonder with what you had to work with, really. $boss needs to save some face for her higher-ups. And, as you know, we are working on a project which is almost the same as yours. So just say that your app is a prototype to find out what your department needed anyway, and integrate all them fields into our software. That's the way it was supposed to go anyway.

&gt; $win4free: ... why did you not tell me that earlier?

&gt; $ITwannabe: Hey, you didn't ask.

Granted, I did not ask. The reason is that he never has been available up to now.

&gt; $win4free: Okay... that just might work. I'll talk with $boss and see what I can do. Thanks!

Off I go to $boss and tell her of my new plan: Get all our fields and data needed over to $ITwannabe and his team, integrate our stuff into their web-based frontend and have him gather all the data I already have and integrate that into the backend. Problem solved!

&gt; $boss: No, not problem solved. We need that NOW.

&gt; $win4free: Yeah, well... but it does not work. I cannot give you ""now"".

&gt; $boss: Then find another solution while you work this thing out with $ITwannabe.

So, I still try to resurrect the corpse which is my application to make it travel-worthy (of course no chance that that'll happen) while working with $ITwannabe on integrating our stuff into their project. Smooth sailing, to be honest, it works more or less great and after only two weeks, I got almost everything in their cloud solution that I have in my app.

In comes $boss.

&gt; $boss: Hey $win4free, I just had an idea!

&gt; $win4free: Do tell, I'm all ears.

&gt; $boss: We do it like in the old days! Use Excel!

My mouth drops open. It remains so for a good minute while $boss stands there, radiating brilliance (in her own mind) and watching me like I would have to praise her in one moment.

&gt; $win4free: Excel?

&gt; $boss: Yeah! Just get the customer/project correlations onto Excel, we can send them out to our guys and they'll fill it out and send it back once a month!

&gt; $win4free: What about all that customer data...?

&gt; $boss: Oh, that's not that important anyway.

Five minutes later I am smoking three to four cigarettes every five minutes in our smoker breakroom while trying to keep myself under control. I replay it in my mind time and time again.

*Oh, customer data is not that important anyway.*

*Not that important.*

*Anyway.*

I want to cry. I really do. What have I been doing this last half year? Building something which, for the largest part, was not needed anyway? Are you f-ing kidding me? And now **Excel?!**

I give up. It is only two to three more weeks I have to endure this, and then I am off, contracts finished, I am out.

Let's do some Excel.

I rebuild the matrix my Greek emperor dragon likes so much in Excel. I get a spreadsheet for every customer, sorted by countries; I copy what I have on correlating data regarding projects. I build one ""admin Excel sheet"" which has all spreadsheets of all countries in it and has a button with which you can select the files, and it copies their contents to the right spreadsheet.

It is a work done in about one week and a half.

$boss is overjoyed.

$bigBoss has his matrix and therefore is happy.

$ITwannabe has our fields and data now in his application, as much as he can put in since they too are nearing their deadline.

$coworker just laughs all the time, either out of desperation or because she just cannot fathom how f-ed up all this is.

I got almost a thousand bucks (with no taxes, even!) a month for making a ""prototype"" and in the end, changing to Excel.

When my contract runs out and I am on my last day of work, $boss meets me in my work space.

&gt; $boss: Hey $win4free! Say, would you like us to continue your contract? Work another half year here with us?

I look at $coworker, who smirks. I think about all the shit I have done which, in the end, and probably to no small part to my own incompetence, did not matter at all.

&gt; $win4free: No, thanks.

And I run to freedom.
_________________________

That's it, folks! Some last information:

The reason $boss had so many meetings was that the department was way behind with their numbers. They apparently tried to hide the fact that they made almost no new contracts in the complete year of 2016 and therefore went straight from black  to almost red numbers.

Three weeks ago, it was announced that $company would sell the complete sector that department was based in. So, $coworker would (probably) never have to work with $boss again, and since all that had been an open secret in the department itself, quite a lot of people tried to find a new job while the inevitable was approaching.

Don't know much about what happened to $bigBoss, but I sure hope he's doing okay.

$ITwannabe finally managed to roll out his three-year-project and it worked... to a certain degree. Apparently, having a cloud service provider as your data, frontend AND backend manager was not that good of an idea. (They just wrote to said provider what they needed and trusted that they'd do it - till they found out that they requested the impossible.)

I went on studying, failed and now am doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist for application development. I get to work with people who know their stuff and gladly share it with me, and just last week, I finally found out how to size a server appropriately. I've also never touched Access again to this day.

I learned a lot in those months. How to not start a project; how to not hope for the best; how to make sure your ass is covered. It tremendously helped me in my later life and I guess I can say that I'm all that wiser, now.

Hope you enjoyed the story! If you have any questions, I'll gladly answer them. And to my ""colleagues"" (since I don't count myself to them) who are in a similar situation I say: Hang in there. Some time in the future, after all the frustration and anger is gone, you'll laugh about it - as did I.

quilladdiction,Toaster.,"Toaster, TFTS. Toaster. The hot bread crisper-upper.

I clarify this because when I first overheard that word in a sentence with ""monitor"" and ""melted"" I though for damn sure my ears were tricking me. Not a bad assumption. I was listening to crackly call recordings through one shitty, tinny-sounding earbud at the time and every other noise was kind of a background wash. I could *not* have heard that right.

But no. No, that was in fact a sentence that was said. I turned around and hardly needed to ask to confirm. $Dani and $Manny - my fellow tech and our direct supervisor, respectively - looked about as dumbfounded as I felt.

I asked anyway. Too surreal.

&gt; $Quill: \*earbud yank* Sorry, did you just say someone *melted* a monitor?
&gt; 
&gt; $Manny: \*patented ""losing faith in humanity again"" sigh*
&gt; 
&gt; $Dani: \*flatly* With a toaster. Monitor *and* keyboard.
&gt; 
&gt; $Manny: ...and a mouse. And some cables.

A lot of silent, slackjawed staring followed that one. Well, between me and $Dani, anyway. $Manny just looked like he was considering an atomic headdesk.

&gt; $Quill: How in the absolute fuck...?
&gt; 
&gt; $Dani: \*almost serious* $Manny, can I slap the user?
&gt; 
&gt; $Quill: \*with my face in my hands* Christ, I'll slap them if you don't. *Why* was there a toaster!?

I mean, obviously because breakfast. What else would you ever do with a toaster, right? And hey, her cubicle, her rules. Why should she not tote a kitchen appliance all the way to work to wedge onto an already overcrowded desk? Who wants to wait five extra minutes in the morning to eat at home when you could do it from the comfort of your shared administrative office space? Sure there's one in the break room, but that's a *public* toaster used by god-knows-which-coworker. Besides which, it's all the way down the hall. Toaster on desk. That makes so much more sense.

I saw the aftermath a few hours later - $Dani had refrained from slapping the user, but very pointedly said nothing the entire time she was collecting the poor mangled electronics. The monitor, as it turned out, had not melted, but the heat had turned most of the screen white. The cables were fine, never got word on whether the mouse still worked, but the keyboard was toast (pun intentional, I'm not sorry). The spacebar was drooping. There were tiny little puddles of plastic underneath and several of the bottom row letters were all warped to shit. It looked like Salvador Dali had tried his hand at sculpting and abandoned the project halfway through.

This is an educational institution, guys. She shoved a toaster under her monitor and in front of her keyboard and proceeded to make a bagel and walk away. It happened a couple months ago now and I've told the story to a good handful of friends and family members; I'm still bewildered.

Like Noah with his ark seeing the dove with its stick, I judge the absence of further emails as a sign from the IT gods that I finally have their blessing and can continue with my work. By now - which is about another two weeks later - the application finally is taking shape in UI references as well as functionality. I got everything in there I want to: the connections between projects and customers can be established with a few easy clicks, the results are shown in a way I can live with - it was not beautiful, but you could see all the relevant information on a glance. Every other part of the project and / or customer can be found too, every little detail $boss totally wanted in there is in there and can be configured right in the application, and I even got around to some security stuff, like editing rights through user groups.

In other words: I think I am finished with this part. Finally. This is, all in all, about four to five months in. (I cannot really remember, it was quite some time ago now and seriously, I tried to forget most of it.)

What I am missing right now is a server; I was told someone (that someone being $ITwannabe, so no one really) would find one for me in the company since they have ""no own IT"". (What the hell am I doing here, then, you might ask? Heck if I know.)

So, it is time for testing.

$coworker, may the IT gods always hold their hands over her and protect her from the fiery fire of $boss (which indeed they did - but in another way she probably liked), makes a few calls. We get people from around Germany hook up, send them the frontend application all ready and configured, and they try it.

It works. Not like a charm - the backend still sits on my laptop which is not a piece of crap, but very close to it, and my internet connection is not all that nice either - but it f-ing works. I am thrilled, as is $coworker. We both go over to $boss to bring her the good news, since $coworker has always been there for me if I had a problem, and I want to share this little victory with her.

&gt; $win4free: Hey $boss, good news! First testing seems fine. As soon as we get a server for the backend, the application can officially be rolled out!

&gt; $boss: Very nice! Get to it! Oh, hey $coworker, you need something?

&gt; $coworker: (looks at me a bit uncertain) Um, no. Just wanted to come with $win4free, really. We worked on this together, after all.

&gt; $win4free: Yah, couldn't have done it without her -

&gt; $boss: Very nice, I'm sure. Well, I gotta go, another meeting, ta!

And off she goes. I shit you not, that happened exactly like described.

We go back to our workstations a bit deflated. But hey, we got the app running! Time to get that backend to where it belongs.

$coworker spends the next complete week trying to find a server in our company premises without consorting to our external IT services. She knows they suck, I know it (since I actually worked for them about two years earlier until I dropped out because I was a lazy piece of shit... and probably still am) and our goal right now is to find someone with a server and a little ""spare room"" on it so we can squeeze in there. Apparently, that is the way they do stuff around here.

After that week, which I spend with a little bug fixing and UI redecoration, we come up with nothing. Crap. Time to call that external IT service.

&gt; $extIT: Good morning, this is $externalITService, how may I help you today?

&gt; $win4free: Hey, this is $win4free with $company. I need a server for my little baby database here. Something low-scale really, it won't be needed all that much and we can afford to have people wait a few seconds for their results.

Not my words, mind you. $boss has a tight budget, at least she told me that.

&gt; $extIT: Sure thing! Can you give me any specifications for the server you need?

&gt; $win4free: Something with at least 32GB RAM, a decent CPU and a 1TB hard drive would probably do, really. If it has a bit more, I wouldn't be mad, mind you.

&gt; $extIT: Okay, nice! We can have that installed in at least 4 to 6 weeks.

I almost spill my coffee over that.

&gt; $win4free: (coughing) Sorry, excuse me, did you say *4 to 6 weeks?!*

&gt; $extIT: Yeah... I'm sorry, but we have a lot of contracts right now, and although your company has a VIP status, it'll take us some time to scrounge up the hardware.

&gt; $win4free: Okay... well, if there is no other way... how much will it cost?

&gt; $extIT: Oh, something above 10.000€, but not too much above that. Per month.

Cue the second coughening. I hate it when I got coffee on my table, but in this case, I just cannot help myself.

&gt; $win4free: HOW MUCH?!

&gt; $extIT: Um... yeah, about that much. That's standard.

&gt; $win4free: I'm asking for what is essentially a 300€ computer plugged in to some decent internet, and you want to charge my department five figures for that?!

&gt; $extIT: Well... yeah.

&gt; $win4free: (breathing heavy because of loss of coffee and, apparently, sense) Okay, thanks. I'll talk with my boss.

I hang up. $coworker sees my face and immediately becomes concerned about my well-being.

&gt; $coworker: Everything's all right?

&gt; $win4free: No. Nothing is.

Off I go to see $boss. Time to find out how hot that fire really is. Lucky for me, I find her in a good mood. Unlucky for me, I also find out why.

&gt; $win4free: Hey, $boss -

&gt; $boss: Hey! Just the man I wanted to talk to! $bigBoss really is excited about the application you build! Is it ready to roll out now?

&gt; $win4free: Um, yeah, about that -

&gt; $boss: And have you tested it with other countries already?

I am taken aback. Other countries? Tested with? Wha?

&gt; $win4free: ... what other countries?

&gt; $boss: We got some people in Spain, England, the US, South Korea... they need to work with the app! You know that! (laughing)

&gt; $win4free: (not even cracking a smile) No, I don't. You never told me.

&gt; $boss: What? Of course I did, it is in the mails we exchanged in the beginning -

&gt; $win4free: No, it isn't. There is nothing about going world wide with this app. Nothing. Not a single thing.

&gt; $boss: Now look, I distinctly remember I've put it in there -

&gt; $win4free: Shall we check?

Now she is pissed, because I keep interrupting her little monologue. But to be honest? At this point, I don't give a single fuck anymore.

&gt; $boss: No, no time for that. It's your job, just make it happen.

&gt; $win4free: Can't.

&gt; $boss: What do you mean, you can't?

&gt; $win4free: 'Cause of Access. It's not designed to go world wide. It's not even designed to go Germany wide if you get my drift. It's usually used in a single environment like a warehouse, not country wide.

&gt; $boss: You never told me that!

&gt; $win4free: You told me that it would be deployed in Germany. I can work with that. I cannot do world wide.

&gt; $boss: And how do you know that?

&gt; $win4free: Because I read it in the documentation.

&gt; $boss: Nonsense! Just try it, will you? I got a man in South Korea, he'll be your test partner. Gotta go now, another meeting, ta!

She has a lot of meetings, now. I don't know what that really is about, but I have a feeling. Rumor is that our department is not doing well at all (I could tell you some juicy stories about that, but confidentiality bars the way) and I guess she is pulling some strings now for the worst case.

The next day, I have a phone number and some instructions on my table. The instructions are: call before 0800 hours or the man in South Korea is already gone to sleep. Also his email address, to which I immediately send the frontend. Then I call the number.

&gt; $CiK: Evening.

&gt; $win4free: Hey, this is $win4free with $company, I was told by $boss to call you for some testing of our new application?

&gt; $CiK: Oh hey! Nice to hear from you, and you're lucky, I was just about to leave!

&gt; $win4free: Well, no worries, I'll try to keep this quick. In my opinion, this is a huge mistake, anyway.

&gt; $CiK: Um, what makes you say that?

&gt; $win4free: Because I have to use Microsoft Access for this.

Cue heartfelt groan on the end of the line.

&gt; $CiK: Why in the seven hells would you do that?

&gt; $win4free: Not my choice, guv. Anyway, you should have an email with the frontend all ready and configured. Could you just try to launch it and see how fast it is with the data transfer from here to you?

&gt; $CiK: Sure, gimme a sec...

He opens the application. The first thing after starting it is a welcome screen with a little drop down menu in which you select the customer you want to see, or a button which sends you straight to the projects. He clicks on the drop down menu.

&gt; $win4free: And...?

&gt; $CiK: Still waiting.

&gt; $win4free: (after one minute) How about now?

&gt; $CiK: Nope, still waiting. How long you figure this is gonna take?

&gt; $win4free: I bet you five bucks that it'll be five minutes.

&gt; $CiK: You're on. I say it'll be ten.

We wait some more, talk about life in South Korea and how the things are back home. He is a really nice guy, and after hearing that $boss made me use Access, he starts his monologue about how I should have stood up to good programming and common sense as well.

&gt; $CiK: So yeah, no one uses Access for stuff like that, and good riddance to that, too - oh wait, it's finished! The drop down menu is up!

&gt; $win4free: (looks at the clock) Seven minutes. Guess we both lost.

&gt; $CiK: Guess I won't have to tell you that this is not acceptable?

&gt; $win4free: What, really? (laughing)

&gt; $CiK: Anyway, nice talking with you, give my regards to $boss and her shitty choices. I'll be in tomorrow at about the same time if you need me.

&gt; $win4free: Thank you very much, and have a good night.

I hit off an email to $boss saying what I told her before: No way we can make this work. I also include the part about the five figures server. Done everything I can considering this particular problem, I go back to bug fixing.

A few minutes later, $boss is in my room.

&gt; $boss: This is un-ac-cep-tab-le!

&gt; $win4free: Oh, hey boss.

&gt; $boss: Seven minutes to open a drop down menu? You must be joking!

&gt; $win4free: Nope. No jokes intended. I told you that Access cannot work overseas, let alone to the neighbouring country.

&gt; $boss: But you told me -

&gt; $win4free: I told you *nothing*. YOU told me to use Access, and I told you that this is a bad idea, especially after I read into it. You said to go ahead, and I did.

&gt; $boss: But...

&gt; $win4free: No ""buts"". It can't be done. End of line.

And then, something remarkable happens. $boss gives me a long look, as she does to $coworker. And then she leaves.

$coworker and I look at each other.

&gt; $win4free: I think I broke her.

&gt; $coworker: (with a little smile) Well done.

ITSupportZombie,The custom convertible laptop.,"So…  This just happened, as I was writing my other story for today.  I don’t usually share stories from my current job, this one is the exception.

Recently one of our offices received new computers; 12.5” notebooks and 12.5” convertible hybrids.

A user walks in with a laptop that is in two pieces.  He explains that his convertible (the kind that is a tablet with an attachable keyboard) is broken.  As I come to the realization that I issued this user a notebook, NOT a convertible, he drops the device on my desk.  (That’s right; he somehow tore the lid from the base of the notebook thinking that he got a convertible.)  I tell him that this wasn’t a convertible, it was a notebook.  It WAS a notebook, now it’s a paperweight.  Somehow this is beyond his comprehension.  His response was that his other coworker got a convertible and that no one told him his wasn’t so he thought it was stuck and he need to pull harder.  I ask him how hard he pulled and if that didn’t give him some indication that it was not a convertible, I receive a blank stare in return.

After some back and forth, I asked him to leave my office.  I could not take it anymore; I did not want to lose my composure.  On his way out of my office, he asks when he will get a replacement.

I take this to my boss, who asks me how long it will take to fix and when can I get this user a replacement.  He apparently sees nothing wrong with this situation.  I am giving this user the biggest heaviest laptop I have.

This is why I drink.

ThorOfKenya2,"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.","Had this happen today and made for an interesting afternoon.

Some specialized industrial printers were ordered and needed to get network access.  So I grab our static IP info, hand it to the install tech, and confirm network connectivity.  Everything seems simple enough but then I notice strange drops from these units.  

One unit would be reachable and the other not but then the inverse happens after a few seconds.  I made sure the local switch isn't throwing any random messages and connecting a laptop directly showed no drops.  Digging one more time into the printer configs I spotted the issue, as improbable as it was.

All printers had the same MAC address.  

I stared at my screen, all printers side by side, same MAC address.  There was no way of changing them from either the access panel nor the web console.  Then came the fun of  explaining the issue to the onsite tech, their tech team, AND the manufacturer support.   Yes, they have the correct IP info, yes I can print and ping them, yes I STILL have a problem!  

We then look to the packaging the NIC cards came so I can relay the from-manufacturer information that should contain the assigned MAC address for the cards.  What was shown started to put the puzzle together.

TESTWIREDMAC

It seems that, at factory, these cards were set to put a test MAC on the units and not the real ones they were to be assigned.   This was the case for all printer we received!  So that we could  quickly resolve this issue, the install tech contacted their distribution team to send us new card BUT to confirm the MACs first.  Every single card they had of the same model had the same MAC.

The installation team apologized for the mishap and sent a company-wide email stating these particular card were faulty.  Luckily these printers were not ready for production but they could be trained on while they fight with the manufacturer.

I've seen some odd thing in may career but this is the first hard breaking bug I have encountered and repeatable at the manufacturing level!  Now if you excuse me, I need to double the creamer in my coffee..",talesfromtechsupport,631,1512101752

$user- Mobile MRI Technician

$rad- Chief of Radiology

I work in Healthcare IT but end up mainly resetting passwords for $doctors all day. Today was a little different.

We have a mobile MRI trailer parked outside of our facility. It has a power and Network jack set up specifically for it on the outside of the building. They pull up, plug in, and start scanning folks- that's how it is supposed to work. The setup is, what most would assume, foolproof. We just hadn't planned on someone like $user.

Today I get this-

&gt;$rad- The MRI Trailer has no network connection, can you please come take a look?

&gt;$me- On my way.

I take a laptop and a fluke cable tester and go out there. I do a quick look around at everything I can see and am allowed to fix (MRI trailer belongs to them so technically I can't work on it or it's little intranet). I test cables, verify hot switch ports, etc. In the end, I plug my laptop into the cable they use to connect and show them that there IS INDEED network connection coming all the way out to their trailer, but something in their intranet is messed up- a switch, router, shorted cable, etc- that is causing the issue.

&gt;$user- Can't you just fix it?

&gt;$me- Unfortunately, the trailer belongs to your company and I'm not authorized to  attempt any repairs on anything that doesn't explicitly belong to our hospital.

&gt;$user- Just do your job and fix it!

Etc, so on and so forth. I have to, over the course of the next hour, speak to $rad, $user, $user's supervisor, and a host of own admin team, and personally show them all how the network works just fine up until they try to connect their trailer to it. 

Meanwhile, $user is being increasingly angry and ugly about the situation. Calling $me lazy, saying I'm trying to shift the blame for the problem so it wouldn't be my responsibility, etc. Trying her best to throw me under the bus.

Finally, I hear from one of their companies' technicians- They had just installed a new switch in that trailer, and could I please verify that it was plugged in and working for them.

Guess what wasn't plugged in? The little switch. It was mounted in a pretty well hidden area up under a desk/cabinet thing. The power cable, however, was routed out onto the desk, and plugged into the wall in plain view. 

$User had just UNPLUGGED it from the power outlet it was plugged into, and INSTEAD had plugged in her cell phone charger.

I plugged it in. Their network sprang to life.

I went ahead and filled out my helpdesk ticket with all of the pertinent information and our department sent their company an invoice for our time spent- about half of the day, or over $1000- because $user decided she needed candy crush worse than patients needed accurate MRI readings.

**TL,DR- User unplugs stuff, plays candy crush. I get lots of internet points telling you all about it.**

First a bit of background. I work at an MSP and I recently did a full upgrade to this clients system so i knew exactly what was installed and what was not. All domain accounts needed local admin due to janky obscure software.

SnArL817,"Turkey Day Emergency, or, You Didn't Follow The Process So You Didn't Get The Work","The week before Thanksgiving, I get a request for the development team. They've spun up a new test environment, and wanted a VIP set up on the load balancer. The network team provisions and configures the VIP, then sends me the ticket to add the VIP hostname to DNS. Easy-peasy, I update the zone files. The next week, I'm on vacation.  
  
Imagine my surprise when I check my phone the next week and see that the development team is FREAKING OUT because they can't hit the VIP from the Internet.  
  
Their application integrates with an external company, and the external company can't connect to the application. The development manager asks the Internet for the IP associated with the hostname, and gets a response that the name doesn't exist. This is because we have 2 DNS servers: internal and external. Now, adding a hostname to the internal server just takes an approved request. It's no big deal. And since they use the load balancer for EVERYTHING (that's an issue in and of itself), it's not uncommon for networking to create VIPs for the applications to use internally.  But if they want a hostname EXTERNALLY resolvable, it take a CHANGE ticket. You know, because the external DNS is *kind of important*.  
  
They never submitted a change ticket. So the entry was INTERNAL only. Meanwhile, my team is chasing their tails looking at firewall rules. Good thing I'm on vacation and don't have to deal with this shit!  
  
Of course, this gets escalated because it's SUPER critical that we fix a non-prod issue. Development OPENS A CRITICAL INCIDENT WITH CORPORATE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT ON THANKSGIVING DAY. They page out the oncall, who is also on vacation that week. He tells them that it can wait, because they need a CHANGE TICKET for us to touch the external DNS server.  They are not happy. That's fine...he's MAD because they interrupted his holiday for a non-prod issue.  
  
Monday morning, I get to the office and my boss wants to know why development opened a critical incident on a holiday. I explained that they didn't follow the process for making a change to the external DNS, so the entry wasn't created. Then the developer stops by and wants to know why I need a change ticket when one was never needed before.  Well, the previous team didn't do things right. As evidenced by the MOUNTAIN of issues I'm trying to fix. They'd been told when I took over that we need change tickets for external DNS updates. Apparently they didn't think it applied to them. Or, more likely, they didn't know that they needed their VIP to be externally resolvable.  
  
Either way, I told MY management that if this happens again, they'll only get support during business hours. Non-prod is non-critical...I don't care HOW important your project timeline is.",talesfromtechsupport,1254,1511973271

Oneota,The Tale of the Missing Bell Software,"I work in K-12 IT for a school district in the midwest US with about 4,000 students.  Our high school was rebuilt in a phased project that lasted from 2006-2009.  Our tale today comes to us courtesy of the bells/intercom system in this building, which, for cost-cutting reasons, was transferred over from the original building instead of being purchased new with the reconstruction (a decision outside of my control).

Cast: $me - District's IT manager.  Department of 3 (Me, Assistant IT Mgr, and a tech) responsible for the entire district (2,000 proper computers, 2,500 Chromebooks, 500 iPads, assorted printers, network, WiFi, projectors, etc).

$Principal - High School principal

$FOC - Freakin' Old Contractor - runs a local AudioVisual/Integration business.  Nice guy, his company has somehow come to be in the position of providing support for our intercom system.  Has also done a few Audio/Visual projects in the building.  Aging gentleman, seems to be having Parkinsons-like symptoms, usually ends up spending most of his time on-site telling me how things have changed in the 30+ years he's been in the business and telling me how we need to just replace the bell/intercom system (which his company just happens to sell, but still - he's right, it needs to be put out to pasture).  I suspect he's got another year or two before he decides to hand his business over to someone else.

Our $Principal had a hands-on relationship with the bell system in his building (which, incidentally, is where my office and datacenter are located, despite my responsibility being for the entire district).  He would come in and set the schedules, tweak settings, and basically sort of made it his own thing.  We've had problems with the system since the day it was installed in the old building a couple of years before the reconstruction, and things didn't magically fix themselves when it was transferred to the new building.  Thankfully, this was one of the few areas where I really wasn't expected to provide any support or have any involvement, so the fact that the system sucked wasn't my problem, and I was totally okay with that.

The $principal had a laptop that was supposed to be dedicated to the building's security cameras, but which also happened to have the software on it to connect to the bell system to let $principal do his tweaking.  This laptop royally sucked at life - the security camera vendors provided it without consulting with me about its specs or anything, and it was a crummy consumer-grade el-cheapo laptop that was underpowered for its job from the day it was taken out of the box.  It was originally running Windows 7 (Home edition!  I mean, really...) and halfway through last school year I decided to see if it could handle Windows 10 as a last-ditch effort to make it better.  I maxed out its RAM, and surprisingly enough, it was actually a more responsive box with Windows 10 than it had been with Windows 7.  I did a wipe-and-install, but before I wiped the disk, I saw the software needed for the bell system, and made an honest attempt to copy it over.  I didn't have any experience with it, though, and so I had no particularly good way of determining if my transfer had worked.  I figured, if it didn't work, I would be told, and we'd re-install from wherever it had come from in the first place - no biggie.  

Even though W10 was better than W7 on this box, it was still an awful end-user experience, so this year, about 7 years after it originally came on-site, I decided to put it out of its misery.  I got a nice new laptop prepped for the principal.  Fast forward a few months, and $principal wants $FOC to make another attempt at fixing some latent issues hanging around in the bell system.  This is apparently the first time he's tried to connect to the system since before I wiped his original laptop from Windows 7 up to Windows 10, and certainly the first time with his new security camera laptop.  This is where our tale begins.

&gt;$Principal: $Me, I've asked $FOC to work on the bells, but my new security camera laptop doesn't have the software.  Can you hep?

&gt;$Me: ""Sure, let's see what's up.""

Hmm...apparently forgot to re-transfer the already-transferred-once software over.  Fortunately, I happen to have the original laptop sitting in a pile of waiting-to-be-recycled hardware, so let's pull it out.  
&gt; *Launches software*

Darn...basically immediate crash whining about missing DLL files.  Googling the names of the missing DLL files reveals that the original software was written in Visual Basic 4, and compiled as a 16-bit project.  Yeah.  Further research reveals that its original system requirements talk about how you can install it on Windows 3.1, Windows 95, or Windows 98.  Running in that new-fangled Windows NT 4 is ""Not supported.""  

Our intercom/bell system was manufactured by a large company, and their PA/bell division had apparently been bought and sold a few times over, and the system is old enough that no one wants to acknowledge its existence or support it.  There's very little mention of the system on the internet, and the software needed to manage it simply isn't available.  There isn't a supported, sanctioned copy out there anywhere.  The original bell system vendor (a small local company who was heavily involved in the high school's reconstruction) apparently installed the software on $principal's security camera laptop years ago, and they've fallen off the face of the planet in the intervening years, so we can't contact them to get a copy.  I had assumed our department installed it, and as such, assumed we'd have its installer in our repository, but that ended up not being the case.  This could potentially be very bad.  Even though I don't support the bell system, the fact that we no longer have a functioning copy of its management software is my fault, so I'm determined to fix it.

I put on my Sherlock Holmes hat and start scouring the 'Net.  There's a forum where other sysadmins have lamented the software's disappearance, and one responder has offered to send copies out to people, but those responses are over a year old in some cases.  Still, I give it a shot and put in a ""Me, too"" response.  I figure, on the off-chance that I get a response, I'll treat the copy I get from that person as a last-resort (after all, installing software you get from random-person-on-the-internet isn't exactly a Best Practice).  Other than that, I come up empty-handed.  I find a handful of the old, 16-bit DLL files this software complains about missing, but I'm still not able to get the software back to a fully-functioning condition.

I get desperate and search my email to see if I happened to have been included on any correspondence with the original vendor years ago about this software, and lo-and-behold, find an email from $principal with an attachment containing an installer for the software!  Woo Hoo!  Except...the email is from 2009.  We transitioned from a locally-hosted, Dovecot-based mail system to Google Apps for Education about 4 years ago.  While the email that $principal sent me made the leap from the old system to the new, the attachment did not - it's a 0-byte file.  You know those scenes in the movies where the hero jumps a chasm and gets about 90% of the way across the gap and then falls?  That face he makes just before gravity takes hold was the same one I made when the attachment failed to download.

Fortunately, I'm a digital pack-rat, and we did a Physical-to-Virtual migration of our old mail server after we decommissioned it.  I fire up the old mail server VM, and check to make sure all the files it expected to be there were present.  I wouldn't be able to connect using a standard mail client, since none of the DNS names were valid anymore, the VM wouldn't be getting the IPs it expected to get, and we had changed directory servers, so the mail server had no idea who anyone was anymore, but that was okay.  I have enough Dovecot experience to know that it stores client mail files as plaintext.  The email is there somewhere, I just have to find it.

I look through my current mailboxes to find one whose name was likely to be unique to my mail hierarchy, and which would have existed back in 2009.  Run a quick `find` command to figure out the path to my mail store on the original mail server.  Then `grep` the mailbox to find the original copy of the email that $principal sent me.  Found it!  Copy-paste the Base-64 text containing the attachment to a new file, and decode that into my prize: A 3.8 MB .zip file.

Bring that over to the original laptop, and....it fails to install.  But!  It installed a lot of the missing .DLL files before it died.  I'm able to combine those .DLL files with the ones I found on the internet and am able to get the software to launch and not complain about missing any files.  I had honestly expected to have to set up a VM running XP or Win 7 to get the software to work (being 16-bit VB4 code, after all), but surprisingly enough, it works fine on the original laptop.  I'm sure that's because I stuck with 32-bit Windows 10 on it.  I have no doubt at all that this software will never run on $principal's new 64-bit laptop, but oh well.  $FOC was able to get his work done, and after hearing my tale, said that I had saved the district a LOT of money by getting this software back into operation, since new intercom systems run into 5-figures pretty easily.  I smile, and keep to myself that I had already basically told $principal that he needs to be talking to our CFO about replacing the intercom system with something that we can actually support with modern tools.  I'm sure $FOC will be getting a call from him soon to discuss possibilities.  Merry Christmas, old man.

Oh, and about half an hour after I get the software working, I get a reply from the forum with a link to a 3.8 MB .zip file.",talesfromtechsupport,1084,1511759228

Selben,The Goodi the Baddi and the Nauti,"**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**

&amp;nbsp;

**$Selben:** Me! “Technical team lead” previously Tier II ~~helldesk~~ helpdesk technician for a mid-sized company, very skeleton-crew helpdesk 10 of us total for 24 hour coverage (not including supervisors) to support 2500+ company-wide.

**$Snickers:** My cubicle mate, also “Technical team lead” previously Tier 2. (*Tier 2 was a more advanced tech, having more experience and system access etc…*)

**$Peer:** Random Tier1 technician. (*Tier 1 worked base calls and sorted them to other groups, only basic troubleshooting*)

**$Goodi:** Intern1, chosen for their extra efforts put in at school and showing an understanding of the basics.

**$Baddi:** Intern2, still in college - got in due to a mistake.

**$Nauti:** Intern3, have a hunch on how they made it through the interview…


&amp;nbsp;

Monday arrived, $Selben dredged into the office and stopped by his desk to drop off his bag… Three young strangers sat in his place, borrowed chairs from other desks. $Snickers had his headphones on and was opening and closing random documents - clearly avoiding any involvement, jerk. $Selben simple placed the bag on his desk and retreated for some coffee before dealing with this - after his return, all three now stood and cleared a way for him to sit.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; $Selben: Morning…

&gt; $Goodi: Morning sir! I am $Goodi, we were told to report to you!

$Baddi looked bored and stared off ~~into the deepest depths of the infinite void that made up the very existence of time and space~~ at the wall.

&gt; $Nauti: I told them we they shouldn’t sit in your chair, I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again!

$Goodi and $Nauti glared at each-other.

&gt; $Selben: Okay… Well anyway - lets get you started on a project. Have any of your dealt with hardware repair or $Ticketsys?

&gt; $Goodi: I’ve done some hardware repair… I’m not familiar with $Ticketsys…

&gt; $Nauti: **I** built my own gaming rig, it was *over* $2000. At my *last* internship I worked on a system far better than $Ticketsys, so it should be easy for me to adapt and improve in this system.

$Baddi’s wall staring intensified.

$Selbens expression remained unimpressed.

&amp;nbsp;

The group was assigned to different tasks based on how $Selben felt they might do well, $Goodi was assigned to help work on some hardware - contacting vendors with error codes, a bit of equipment had accumulated recently so it was an excellent task - with some simple corrections he was able to navigate their ticketing system and did well, documenting all calls and putting error codes in the tickets. 

$Baddi on the other hand would be assigned a task… Start it while someone was nearby… Then just stop and stare off into space, they would return after a couple hours to check up and would find nothing completed… $Selben decided to assign $Baddi to listen to the other techs calls and watch them work since he seemed to like watching others. This resulted in him telling one of the female technicians that her hair smelled nice and he ended up being moved to watch $Snickers work instead.

$Nauti on the other hand with his being “familiar” with the ticketing system as well as a special type of handheld scanner (that $Selben knew only their company used) but $Nauti was an “Expert” with them. He was assigned to follow the configuration sheets for each scanner, then update the tickets and have the hardware group ship them out to the requested locations, there were roughly 50 of these scanners. 

Each of the interns were moved around and assigned different random IT work, with their default action to go to their originally assigned tasks. $Snickers would often have to go wandering around the office to find $Baddi, on more than one occasion he would be found sleeping in a conference room - finally after being warned several times that their internship would be terminated they started to make improvements. $Goodi made some mistakes but typically owned up to them offering to fix the issues whenever possible, he was almost offered to be brought on - but wanted to finish school before committing to anything, a bit of a shame because later when he graduated we did not have any positions available.

As for $Nauti… $Selben unfortunately had his hands full with the other two and his own job - so considering the fountain of knowledge $Nauti had claimed he did not followup as well as he should of. Checking with $Nauti, he was informed the project was completed - and he was moved onto a different task… However the final week of the internship $Selben became curious after running into the hardware tech in the break room, he had not received any of the scanners from $Nauti, so $Selben did some digging… He found all of the tickets had been manually voided… Not closed, not resolved, voided…

It was discovered $Nauti had no idea how to work tickets and had inadvertently voided out (*Still not 100% sure how he did this*) every ticket he came in contact with, as for the scanners they had all been hidden in the filing cabinets under $Nauti’s desk. When confronted with the scanners, $Nauti claimed the hardware tech had told him to do this and he was just following his instructions, when the hardware tech was brought in as well - he “wasn’t sure who told him” the following day $Nauti did not show up for his internship, we did not hear back from him again after that.",talesfromtechsupport,621,1511380909
LetMeRunMum,Don't give colleagues too much credit. They might not like it.,"I support a couple of university buildings. Building A, where I am based, is about a decade old, while building B is an old converted school with twisty corridors and out-of-the-way offices. Many of the staff and students in building B have a printer in their office to save them navigating the labyrinth to a Xerox.

When an academic in building B needs printer toner, they email printer.toner@university.org which is seen by both IT staff and the building B receptionist for her to fetch the required toner from building B’s cupboard and email the academic back, asking them to collect it from her desk. This saves me having to walk to building B all day fetching toners. When an academic emails for toner they usually provide their printer model. The receptionist usually then emails me, the academic or both asking what the toner number for that printer model is and then I look it up for her.

Most of the printers are from HP with toner that comes in a black box with its number in big white letters along the side. I recently began ordering Office Depot’s refilled cartridges for a fraction of the price, and these come in a white box with its number in smaller black letters along the side. Last month, receptionist was unable to find an HP 36A toner because it was in one of the newer Office Depot boxes.

It was beside a box HP 35A toner on a shelf of HP toner boxes in numerical order.

Now, looking up toner numbers only takes me a few Googly seconds and I don’t mind doing it, however I was off sick when she emailed me again last week. To prevent her waiting in future, I emailed her with some advice:

&gt; Hi Receptionist,
&gt;  
&gt; You'd be quicker googling ""Printer 123AB toner"" because I don't actually have any of these numbers memorised!
&gt;  
&gt; This one is a 987X, bottom shelf, far right
&gt;  
&gt; Cheers
&gt;  
&gt; Kind Regards
&gt;
&gt; University IT

Soon came the reply:

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;  
&gt; Can you please remove Receptionist from the toner mailing list?
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Office Manager

IT boss and Office Manager had a chat and it seems that Googling toner numbers is legitimately too much for our receptionist to comprehend. I am now copying all of the printer models from our inventory into a spreadsheet and listing the black, cyan, magenta and yellow toner numbers for each, one by one and including variations like high capacity models, because our receptionist is unable to look these up for herself. Serves me right for trying to empower a colleague.

nlm008,HR user from hell,"This morning help desk received a ticket saying a user in HR was transferred to a different department.  We did everything we needed to in AD for the change and told them everything was taken care of on our end. A few hours later we get a ticket saying a few of the users decided to move desks since there was more room.  I decided to go down there to check it out and make sure everything was okay.  I hooked everything up since they obviously messed it all up.  After I was done I had them check it all out and they said everything seemed to be working.  I told them to let us know if they have any issues and left. 

The following happened about an hour later.

&gt;HR User: ""Since my computers was move nthing is wroking.  My drive are gone and we cannt printer.""

&gt;Me: ""Is this happening to everyone or are you the only one experiencing this problem?""

&gt;HR User: ""PRINTER NOT WOKRING!!! AND DRIVES GONE!!!!!!.....""

&gt;Me: ""Okay, I am about to jump into your computer remotely so I can take a look at it and see if I can get it working""

I jumped into her computer and it's not logged in so I call her and ask her to log in.  Suddenly she's extremely polite and asks how she's supposed to log in and I tell her to log in with her normal username and password for Windows.  Once I'm logged in as her the first thing I do is send a test page to the printer and it works with no problems.  I looked for the mapped drive and there is a shortcut on the desktop and a link to it in file explorer, just like it's supposed to be.  I told her everything looks okay and asked her to check it out and she says it's all working. I asked her if anyone else is having trouble she says no, I hang up on the phone and close the ticket.

A little while later she reopens the ticket.

&gt;HR User: ""SAME THING HAPPN AGAIN CAN'T PRINTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11 DrIVES GON""

I remote into her computer again and I see the username HRUser2.  

&gt; Me:  ""You are logged in as HRUser2 instead of HRUser.  It's not working because you are not logged in as yourself on your computer.""

&gt;HR USER: ""HRUSER2 SAR HERE BEFORE I LOG IN AS HRUSER2 NOW!.""

&gt;Me: ""You have to log into your computer as yourself you can't log into your computer as a different user.""

&gt;HRUSER: ""THT DONT MK SINCE SHE SAT HEER BEFORE!!!1""

&gt;Me: ""The desk has nothing to do with how you log in.  You are still using the same computer you were before so you will still log in with the same username and password that you used before you moved.  Also, I am resetting HRUser2's password so you can't log in as her again.  You need to log in as yourself, and you shouldn't know another user's password, that's against company policy and it's also a security risk.""

&gt;HR User: ""U R NO HELP!!1!! ! I WNT SPEAK WIT YOUR MANAGER""

&gt;Me: ""Ma'am I am the manager of Helpdesk, but if you'd like to speak with my supervisor you can reach him here (###)###-#### or here ITDirector@company.com.  Also, here is a link to the employee handbook Section # Article # it states that no user shall log in as another user unless given permission by their immediate supervisor.""

I haven’t heard anything yet and left shortly after all of this was done.  I guess I’ll find out tomorrow if she actually did try to contact my boss.

Update: When I got to work this morning I printed off the ticket and took it to my supervisor.  I asked him if he heard anything from HR about it and he said he hasn't.  He read it, laughed and put it in a folder in his desk labeled ""Folder of shame :("".  My guess is that she decided it wasn't worth the trouble to try to file a complaint or something.  I doubt she realized that she was wrong.  He said he will let the HR manager know about it and recommend a meeting with HR User about company policy and grammar. 

tldr: User moves to old co-worker’s desk, thinks she needs to log in as the old co-worker.  Argues though email and might have filed a complaint against me.

Flyingpancakeattack,Complete lack of understanding of technology = my fault (and other fun things).,"Welcome ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, a tale of frustration, condemnation and helicopter parent melodrama. Sit back, relax and enjoy.... 


So it's been a while since my last post, I'm still at university and going well. As a bit of a background to this story I am an adult volunteer within a youth group that is sponsored by the military in my country for kids between 12 and 18 (not very tech related so far). It teaches stuff like camping, navigation, shooting and some army skills etc. Great stuff. Unfortunately that age range can typically be the worst for the ""my little snowflake"" parents who insist that their child is the best thing since sliced bread and has to be treated accordingly. 

Que to one of the parade nights at our detachment (place we meet) that is situated in a reserve centre (place where part time soldiers train). For security reasons one of us must be at the front gate to make sure no dodgy fellas get in and cause problems (remember: military location), that was me that night. A car with an unknown number plate comes up to the gate and sits there with headlights on (despite the huge clear sign saying **'Turn off all headlights'** as they can blind the guard, important when they need to see who is in it). 

After about 30 seconds of me not opening the vehicle gate, the driver starts honking their horn presumably to make me open it. I shoot a *wtf* look and they honk again. I have no intention of opening it without finding out who is driving this thing. I exit the pedestrian gate and start walking up to the car with a torch in hand, knock on the window and ask the driver to roll down the window. What appeared in front of me was a very huffy looking woman with a kid in an army uniform in the passenger seat...

&gt;$me: Can I see some identification and what your business here is please?

&gt;$angryLady: I'm dropping my kid off, open the gate (doesn't show any ID).

&gt;$me: I cant let parent vehicles inside the compound. You are not an authorised person nor are you driving an authorised vehicle.

&gt;$angryLady: *Visibly upset* It's cold and my baby (who calls their kid baby anymore??) needs to get inside!

&gt;$me: He can get out and walk the five metres to the building door.

&gt;$angryLady: He can't do that he'll freeze!

&gt;$me: Do you have a military ID?

&gt;$angryLady: No.

&gt;$me: then the vehicle cant come in...

She huffs and puffs and swears a bit under her breath, kisses her son goodbye and lets him go in (what a trooper for braving the sub-arctic conditions....not). 

&gt;$angryLady: I want to know why I wasn't told about next week's change of plans either. 

&gt;$me: It was put up on a post in the Facebook group for them a few days ago. He should be in it.

&gt;$angryLady: HE'S TOO YOUNG TO BE ON THE FACEBOOK! (said in a loud screeching tone, the kid is like 14 calm down lady)

&gt;$me: then he was told last week about it and he should have written it down.... You can join that group so you know what's going on in the future.

&gt;$angryLady: *smugly* I don't want you to get my personal information so no I will not be joining it. (Way to go lady, here is where the tech related stuff comes in) I want to speak to your commander about this!

&gt;$me: Ok then miss, please park on the road away from the gate, bring a form of ID and leave any excess bags in the car. I will be able to escort you to the office.

She huffs and puffs again saying 'bullshit' under her breath like I'm deaf or something, throws on her high beams to add insult to injury and spins the car round nearly hitting the wall in the process. She then parks at a crazy angle and slams her door, locking it in the process. She follows me in without much else of a fuss and sits at the Commanding Officer's desk. She shoots me a death glare and waits. The Commanding Officer (CO) walks in and sits down:

$angryLady will be $AL from here on...

&gt;$CO: Good evening miss how can I be of help tonight?

&gt;$AL: I want to know why I'm not being told about changes to the training location next week. This is **my** son we're talking about not just some random person. 

&gt;$CO: *Visibly confused*  Well we have a facebook group that we circulate information like this on. It's a closed and secure group that only us instructors, kids, and their parents can see what's on there. It is very useful as it means that the information is easy to see and always visible.

&gt;$AL: *screetchy voice again and shouting* MY SON IS TOO YOUNG TO BE ON THE FACEBOOK YOU SHOULD FIND ANOTHER WAY OF TELLING ME

$CO is not a man that appreciates being randomly shouted at by people. Most of the time he will shout back and make you be polite, this lady nearly sent him over the edge less than two minutes after meeting him. 

&gt;$CO: *visibly angry and talking through gritted teeth* Then I suggest you join this group to get this information if your son is unable to note it down the previous week... Here Sgt. Flyingpancakeattack can show you (oh no, anything but me having to deal with her further). 

&gt;$AL: No. I don't want your facebook group to know my personal information!

&gt;$CO: That's not how it works, I assure you it's perfectly safe. 

After much bickering and moaning from $AL about how people can steal her information she agrees to be added to the group:

&gt;$AL: So how do I join then? Can I do it here? (Here's where the fun begins and the story turns into a tech one)

&gt;$CO: Sgt. Flyingpancakeattack will show you how to join. I have sent you the invite to it.

I get my laptop out and and set it onto the desk. I log on, sign out of my Facebook account and show her the login screen while $CO leaves the room to cool off and get $AL a cup of tea or something. 

She just stares gormless at the screen.

&gt;$AL: What do I do? (I swear to god she has to be kidding)

&gt;$me: Type your email and password into the top two boxes labelled 'Username or Email' and 'Password'

&gt;$AL: I don't want you keeping my information on your computer!

&gt;$me: I have unticked 'remember me', so when you log out nothing of your's is saved. 

She seems satisfied with that answer and types her email into the box. When she clicks on the password entry she snaps her head round exorcist-style at me and comes out with this gem:

&gt;$AL **Don't you dare look at my password** 

She hunches her shoulders and arms over the keyboard all gremlin like to hide it, presses her face against the screen (ew) and slowly but surely types her password in and clicks 'Log In'. I am fully convinced at this point she is nuts and probably midlife crisis has hit her hard, thus the batshit insane paranoia. She decided to try to cover her news feed with her hand as I look over to her screen to point out the globe icon for the group invite. 

&gt;$me: Go ahead and click the globe icon with the notification on it....

&gt;$AL: *shrill voice* I can't see it!

&gt;$me: *points again* Here.

&gt;$AL: You should have told me it's right there, you aren't very helpful. (Really? Last time I checked I can find the damn icon not you....)

&gt;$me: now click on the 'accept' button where it says ""Group Invite"".

By some small miracle she gets it right and goes onto the page, and then:

&gt;$AL: If I get my details stolen because of this I'll be looking to sue you..

&gt;$me: *internally want to smash my head against the wall until it's pulp*  Okayy, please now log out. 

&gt;$AL: I don't know how I never log out usually. 

Following a rather painstaking and lengthy explanation of how to log out (she refused to let me do it for her for the usual reasons), I had just about had enough and took the laptop away and logged back into my account. This didn't stop $AL from peaking over my shoulder and being nosy on my Facebook... Just then $CO walks back in after maybe crying out of frustration. 

&gt;$CO: Are we all sorted now Miss angryLady?

&gt;$AL: *In a snootish tone* Yes I suppose so, I expect you both to apologise to my son for not getting the correct information to me. As for you *points at me* I hope you learn to be more useful as you are and idiot...

$CO and I just looked at her with more *wtf*. She had also peeked over to me and saw me access a military web portal on my laptop to update some records, that just so happened to be some sensitive files unrelated to her or her son when she bleated out:

$AL: WHAT IS THAT FOR I KNEW YOU WOULD STEAL MY SON'S INFORMATION!!. 

She tried to snatch my laptop away but I quickly shut it and told her it was ""Sensitive and you can't see them"". $AL attempted to force her way to the laptop at which $CO slammed his hand on his desk, stopping $AL in her tracks.

He finally had enough.

&gt;$CO: YOU WILL NOT TREAT MY STAFF LIKE A CRIMINAL MISS ANGRYLADY. SGT. FLYINGPANCAKEATTACK HAS HELPED YOU WITH MORE THAN HE NEEDED. *quietens down*. I suggest you apologise to him now and reevaluate your tone before I am forced to remove you from this building.

$AL sits down and bursts into tears and lets loose a whole load of things. She had just gone through with a divorce with her husband, leaving the kid under her care, the parade nights were a small relief from her looking after her son for a few hours and get some rest. The fact that she was a victim of fraud as well was the main reason she was so paranoid about agreeing to things online and her personal info. She did say sorry and thanked me for the help. 

While I appreciate and certainly cant imagine the stress $AL was going though, neither $CO or me appreciated her trying to take it out on us. After calming down, she asked to be escorted out. She left without another word and waited in her car when she came to pick up the kid later.

Her son wandered into the office, and had obviously been crying. He apologised for his mum's outburst and said that she does that a lot because of the divorce. I feel for the guy as it probably wasn't the first time something like this has happened. It's horrible to see a child (despite being older) take on some of the burden of the parent. 

I kept an eye on him for a while to make sure his situation wasn't getting worse. Seems to be doing OK last time I had a chat.

The moral of this story is despite not being tech heavy, sometimes a user can be going through so much that they lash out at the closest problem, try to have as much patience as you can.

**TL:DR** Don't judge a (Face)book by it's cover.

I'm working the service desk one day when the following miracle on stupidity happened.

phone rings
&gt;$Me - Hello, you have reached such and such at some place.

&gt;$User - I'm at a conference and I'm trying to check me email on my phone, but it isn't working. It doesn't show my latest emails. It is working on my laptop though.

&gt;$Me - I understand. Have you changed your password recently?

&gt;$User - Not for a while now.

&gt;$Me - Ok, maybe we need to reset your account on your phone. Do you have an Android or a MoneyTaker?

&gt;$User - Android.

&gt;$Me - Ok, lets go into Settings, and then look for something that says accounts, or it may list other things along with accounts.

&gt;$User - I see one that says cloud and accounts.

&gt;$Me - Ok, do you see your someplace email listed?

&gt;$User - No

&gt;$Me - Well that's strange. Let's just go ahead and configure it here then. 

I then spend the next 15 minutes going through the settings and configuration for her email, and at no time will it work. It just keeps popping up stating ""Unable to connect to server.""

Just as I am wanting to tell her, sorry you're out of luck she comes up with this gem.

&gt;$User - OH WAIT! Do I need to be connected to the internet for this? I connected my laptop using the hotel login stuff. Do I have to do it on my phone too?

&gt;$Me - Yes, you need to be connected to the internet for your email to sync. Open your wirless and verify you have access to the hotel's WiFi.

&gt;$User - It says I'm connected.

&gt;$Me - Now open your web browser and try to go to a website. It doesn't matter which one, just any site.

&gt;$User - OH! Now it's asking me to login with the info they gave me. It seems to be working now. I really should have thought about that before I called you. Sorry about that. Have a good day.

&gt; **$ME**: Good afternoon, TECH$! Could you verify you're using *$StandardProcess*?

&gt; **$TECH**: Yes

The company I work for has recently gone from using your AD credentials to using 3rd party $SoftToken. This all happened in Q1 of this year with multiple emails and training sessions. In true TFTS fashion, it is now mid-Q4 and I received this ticket: *THE VPN CONNECTION FAILED DUE TO UNSUCCESSFUL DOMAIN NAME RESOLUTION*

***

&gt; **$ME**: Everything looks good on the backend here, are you sure your selecting the VPN connection from the dropdown and using your PIN plus $SoftToken passcode?

&gt; **$TECH**: Yes

&gt; **$ME**: Thank you for confirming that, can you share your screen so I can see exactly what's happening?

&gt; **$TECH**: Yes

$TECH proceeds to open $SoftToken and get a new passcode, then opens up $VPNClient, deletes the current (valid) VPN entry, and types his PIN and generated passcode. Cue *$NameResolutionError*.

&gt; **$TECH**: Did you see the error?

&gt; **$ME**: Yes, but that is not *$StandardProcess*.

I proceed to take control of screen, and select the correct VPN.

&gt; **$ME**: Please enter your the your PIN and the generated passcode in the field labeled PIN and Passcode please.

DallasITGuy,Rule #1: Users lie. Rule #2: They do so for stupid reasons.,"This happened in September but I've not had time until now to post about it.

One of my clients was expanding into more space next door to their existing office space and as a result needed a new Ethernet switch. Their existing switches were very old and a mix of small 100 mbps units with one 8 port gigabit switch that previous IT firms had installed, and I convinced them to let me replace everything with a nice pair of stacked 48 port gigabit switches in a nice compact wall mount rack.

The office manager and I scheduled the upgrade for a weekend and she emailed the staff to let them know they shouldn't come in if they needed access to the computer systems. I came in as planned with my part time assistant, we did the upgrade (even set up VLANs for data and future VOIP), tested everything and went home. One of those projects that went as well as it possibly could.

On Monday morning I get a call from the office manager. One of the staff's systems is dead as a doornail and the user is blaming it on the upgrade, demanding a replacement (in the background I hear her say ""and tell him it needs to be a better one!""), basically causing all kinds of Monday morning drama. I knew it wasn't related to replacing the switches of course - the user is one of those high maintenance types who always blames her computer or the server for her problems, even though that's never been the case. But regardless of what caused it I still had to go on site and fix it, so off I went.

When I arrived the user had the system pulled out and sitting on her desk with a note that said ""Broken by DallasITGuy over the weekend - REPLACE IMMEDIATELY!"". And of course said user was nowhere to be found. I hooked it back up and sure enough, it wouldn't power up. Since the user wasn't there I went ahead and stayed at her desk and opened the case up, figuring maybe it was something straightforward.

As soon as I opened it up it was apparent someone had intentionally broken it. The video card was broken and the power feed to the motherboard had been pulled out and cracked with a pair of pliers. I took a quick photo and got the office manager to take a look. Manager freaks of course, tracks down the user, gets her back to her desk. Situation rapidly deteriorates with accusations flying. 

I finally had to go to the server and (with the office manager and owner looking over my shoulder and having me explain every step of what I'm doing) go through the logs and prove that the user had logged in on that system for a few minutes first thing that day and then logged off - meaning the system had been working when she arrived. 

They were beyond pissed. Told me to take the broken system back to my office and fix it or replace it and after I left sat down with the user, got her to admit she'd damaged the computer (her reason: she felt like she deserved a faster one) and fired her. Got back to my office and there was an email waiting for me telling me to disable her account and bring the system back immediately as they were going to take the cost of it out of her last check and wanted to keep the system as evidence in case she filed for unemployment benefits.

TL;DR: User destroys system to get a better one, blames failure on switch upgrade, gets caught, fired, and charged for the cost of said system.",talesfromtechsupport,3827,1511233024
mountainwombat,Too many buttons,"Sometimes, though not often, I come across a person who really is challenged by technology. Noreen was one of those.

A lady in her 80’s she had spent her working life first in an office then for more than 20 years teaching people in a business college to type and take shorthand. Noreen was a phenomenon, she still used pitman shorthand for her shopping lists. 

A “crafty” woman, she excelled at knitting, crochet, and tapestry work. Alas when it came to technology she had a problem.

The first challenge came when her old TV died; you see the new one came with a remote control. When it was unpacked and set up I first hear the phrase “MountainWombat you know that there are just too buttons!”

I helped by pointing out that all you needed to use was just five of the buttons. The power button, channel up and down, and the sound up and down. Noreen was happy with this, but she asked if she only needed these five why where all the other buttons cluttering up the control?

Next Noreen bought a microwave oven. Again there was “too many buttons”. She resolved this problem herself. Every time you pushed the “start” button it added another minute to the cooking timer.  

Then Christmas came and a DVD as a gift. Fortunately it was the same brand as the TV and that meant only one control, but still there was too many buttons. This was easily solved by using whiteout to paint a circle around the two extra buttons that she used, video select, and the DVD “play” button

 It wasn’t for lack of interest, or of intelligence. Noreen saw technology as being unnecessarily complicated. She was right. A quick check in my lounge room found that I had a total of five remote controls. Even for someone as technically tragic as me this is way too many!

Noreen was not afraid of new things, a mobile phone was next on the shopping list, and she had signed up to a computers for seniors training course in her local community center.

Alas, this was not to be. Noreen, my mother in law passed away suddenly earlier this month.

One of my enduring memories of this wonderful lady was of her looking at me with a small smile turning up the corners of her mouth and a twinkle in her eye as she said “MountainWombat, there are just too many buttons!”

isay2mater,How I learned to stop worrying and love the brown grass: a PSA,"I tried to post this once before but it never showed up.  Hopefully it will show up this time, as I think it's an appropriate time of year, before everyone gets bombarded with family tech support on their trips home for the various holidays...  

I was inspired to write this story when I was going through some old voicemails and got surprised by one of them, then found an unused headset in a box.  I actually am a tech support professional, but this story is about family tech support…  

Like so many here, I often get called by family to troubleshoot various things. For me it’s most often been my mom that gives me these calls.  For instance: she was getting taken by her ISP for about $10 a month for a wireless router, so I give her an old router I found in my closet.  This results in the usual calls about her wifi not working.  I always just grit my teeth, roll my eyes and tell her to unplug it and plug it back in, or remind her(again!) that the wifi password is my phone number.  

Then she had a slight stroke.  It was nothing too major, but it affected her eyesight a little bit which made it hard for her to type very much.  This wouldn’t have been much of an issue, except she likes to write her brother in prison.  She’s heard of speech recognition software and asks me if I can find something that will help her out.  It turns out the leading software for this is pretty expensive, but Windows actually has some speech-to-text capability built-in.  I figured out how to turn it on, picked up a cheap microphone, and took a trip out to see her.  We find that you have to go through some exercises so it can learn your speech patterns, so I explain how to do it and leave her to it.  

She tries now and then to use the speech recognition but it turns out that a microphone sitting on the desk doesn’t work so well.  She asks for more help, but I really don’t have time to sit down and walk her through it.  Besides, if the microphone doesn’t work well, then there’s nothing I can do, right?  I actually do want to help though, so for Christmas I got her a headset microphone.  She seems to be excited, and better yet, she stops calling me about writing letters by talking!  

Soon enough though, I find out why there’s been no calls about the headset:  she hasn’t been feeling well enough to try.  She’s in and out of the hospital a few times for a few minor things, they do some tests, and then finally we find out the reason for all the medical issues: cancer, and it’s bad.  The time after that is frankly a blur of nurses, medical terminology and emotions, and not particularly relevant to this story.  The end result is that she was given 8 weeks…she lasted 4.  

So then I got to clean out her apartment.  My tech support duties there are over.  I got the headset back, it never got taken out of the packaging.  I got the cheap microphone too, and I got my router back.  And I have a single voicemail saved.  It’s about 15 seconds long, and it’s just her asking for the wifi password so her neighbor can use her internet.  I rolled my eyes at that message when I first got it, and now I would like nothing more than to get another one.  

I know the family tech support calls can be annoying, but you should enjoy them while you can.  I complained about them too, and now I will get no more tech support calls from mom. Instead I have some old equipment and a voicemail…and I would do anything to trade back.

Rouziys,Chess nut.,"I am still waiting on how this will end.

Last thursday we were just chilling in the office as our IT deparments boss is on a vacation. Everything works fine, there are no problems. And it's a day before the long 3 day weekend.

Suddenly we get a call that THE BIG BOSS is coming to our place! So we start improvising some work. One of my colleagues steps out of the office to give us more time.

The reason he was coming our way is he is a chess nut. And there is a tournament from friday to monday. As the tech gurus we are, the responsibilities of technically doing this is on our heads. This means we need to connect 20 chess boards via COM ports and connect them to a pc. This takes time. As well we need to check if it finds all the chess boards and if it sends the info to our ftp server. The only thing the chess guys need to do is create matchups (we did enter all the chess players before) and start the tournament. We couldn't create the matchups because there is a lottery before the tournament. This basically took us about 2 and a half hours. Not counting the time it took for us to prepare everything. Basically there was no data transmited to our ftp server because no one created matchups and pressed THE START button. 

So today I'm enjoying my day off and my colleague sends me message that he's basically has been let go.

First of all I thought he was joking. Second of all he only works part time with us. He wanted to leave to concentrate on his business. But THE BIG BOSS asked him to stay part time because he's such an important part of our organization. 

Well he is an important part as each and every website of our organization is either made by him or is administrated by him.

Long story short - we don't work for a chess organization. And organizing a chess tournament for our boss is not something we get payed for and counts as a favour. And now... This..

I'm still waiting for judgement on me and my work. My colleague is pissed as hell and is leaving us. I have applied to 4 job offers today. Just to be on the safe side. 

EDIT
To clear things up.

There is our countries Federation of chess. They organize tournaments. Our BIG BOSS is the second in command in the federation. He uses us - the IT department (a different organization), to set up the tournaments. And every time it is last minute. There are more chess people working in the organization, who don't know shit about IT or setting this whole thing up. So we make it as easy as we can for them to start the tournament.

My colleague got fired because no one pressed the start button and it is somehow his fault.",talesfromtechsupport,677,1511120345
Fearme4life,The computer stuck back in time.,"This will be a quick one that jusy happened to me today. So I work as a cable technician installing/upgrading/fixing service. 

So I am at a job and I was to upgrade their tv boxes and add phone service. I finish everything and while I am teaching them how to use the new equipment the customer says, ""This is great, but can you make sure my internet is actually working, because it wasn't before."" So I quickly connect to the wifi using WPS and test it out and everything is good, but customer says her computer still doesnt work.

Her computer was hardwired to the modem and when I open her browser (internet explorer...sigh) the msn homepage would load, but if you tried to go to ANY page you would get certificate errors and it would not let you get to any page.

I start troubleshooting(aka google). First hotfix that came up was to go into internet options and disable the certificate  security check boxes and fiddle around with some settings which I tried, but no dice. After awhile I decide screw it IE sucks anways I'll just install chrome. There is only one problem, I can get to google and click on download google chrome, but the download pop up gives the certificate error so it wont download. I get visibly annoyed by this (btw im doing all this standing up hovering over the computer).

Next solution says that if you computer lost power or anything it might have reverted to a past date which causes certificate errors. I look at the task bar and see, ""March 3rd 2008 6:43pm"" none of which was correct and a few cuss words are mumbled by me. I had to manually fix the time and then everything was working fine. Customer was estatic and I left.

Post this on mobile on my way home sorry for any typos.

TLDR: Every webpage says certifcate is invalid because they have current dated certificates and the computer thinks its 2008.",talesfromtechsupport,1077,1511043740
VoraciousGorak,That's not our software.,"Was handed a stumper of a ticket by my previous shift today, the easiest stumper I've ever handled.

&gt;$Cubemaster1: ""Gorak, we have one for you to work on tonight. $Client sent us a report screenshot and it's missing half their data. We've checked the DB directly and it all looks good there, but when their on-screen report builds half of it is blank.""

&gt;$Cubemaster2: ""We can't figure out where the break is. Think you'll have a chance to look at it, maybe make some phone calls tonight to see if the remote DB connection needs worked on?""

I take one look at the screenshot.

&gt;$Gorak: ""No.""

The others are taken aback.

&gt;$Cubemaster2: ""Why not?""

&gt;$Gorak: ""Because that's not our software. It's $Company's software.""

The report looks nothing like the reports our software generates. It's been generated by a program that $Client uses that we are familiar with, and we have been given specific instructions not to support it ourselves and to forward all tickets to $Company internal support. My team had this ticket for ten hours before I arrived. Two minutes and a brief email later, it was gone.

EDIT: Our reports showed the data as present and populating; our software and DB were fine. I'd forwarded a nearly identical ticket (so identical I had to check the location ID to make sure they didn't send the same ticket with the same screenshot back to me) that morning.",talesfromtechsupport,1532,1510831371
MAlloc-1024,Here's how I broke the cardinal rule about never pissing off the HR department... (part 2),"see part 1 here for context: https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7cytte/heres_how_i_broke_the_cardinal_rule_about_never/

For backstory, this conversation has been going on via email.

Continuing from here:

$Malloc: Per company policy &lt;number.number&gt; any new software purchase must be approved by the IT department. Can you produce that approval?

$HR: This was approved by the Director of Software development in september.

$Director: yep. I approved that

$Malloc: Ok, again, who is the project implementer so I can get contact information for their tech support team?

$Hr: I've already called their tech support. $Director, $Malloc is being very disrespectful towards me and not provided requested IT support.

$Malloc: $HR, I'm sorry if you feel I am being disrespectful as that is not my intent, but you've asked me to complete a task that I have not been given the tools to complete. The project implementer, nor $Director who approved this software, ever informed myself or my team about this. Additionally no where on their site is a way to contact their tech support. I've been trying for a while to figure out how to get the videos to play on the site while we have been emailing back and forth and frankly I don't even know where the play button is.

$HR: That's not true. $technician uploaded a CSV file of users to their website for us.

$Malloc: just because a member of my team uploaded a file to the backend of the website doesn't mean that we know how to use the rest of their tool. Again, if I had either training or contact information I would be able to help you.

$Hr: we need your expertise on this!

$Malloc: You keep assuming I am an expert on this software which I have never heard of. Can you provide the phone number for their tech support since you have already called them?

$HR: &lt;Number&gt;

Story changes from email to phone:

$Saas Tech: hello this is $saas Tech from &lt;Saas Company&gt;, how can I help you?

$Malloc: Hi this is $malloc from &lt;Company&gt; and our go live is scheduled for today, but the director of HR is telling me no one can watch the training videos ""How to use &lt;SaaS Product&gt;""

$Saas Tech: Do you mean that they don't know where they are or they don't open?

$Malloc: Frankly, I don't know. I was not involved with this project until today, but since I am the tech support manager this became my problem.

$Saas tech: ::sigh:: yeah... I can commiserate with that... Let me go log in as you.

$Malloc: ok, i've gotten as far as seeing the training I'm enrolled in, but there is no video there to play.

$Saas Tech: Ok, well, from there you need to go &lt;drills down 4 levels deeper&gt;. If your HR person puts a due date for completion of the training these will show up on the front page.

$Malloc: She also mentioned something about this only working in Windows 7. We use Windows 10. How can we resolve that?

$Saas Tech: huh? It should work in Windows 10... We do use Flash though so that may cause some issues, and your popup-blocker needs to be turned off for our site. If you're using IE on Windows 7 you will need to add us to your trusted sites and may need to turn on compatibility.

$Malloc: yep, ok I got it working now, thanks!

$Saas Tech: no problem. I'll email you a log of this ticket. Bye!

Returning to email with HR

$Malloc: Spoke with their tech support and I've written up instructions: &lt;instructions&gt;
Please note that this product uses Adobe Flash which is considered a security risk.
Also their tech mentioned that if you set a due date for the training the videos will show up on the homepage when a user logs in.

$Hr: Thank you. We will add the due dates to the training videos. That is what we were missing!",talesfromtechsupport,1105,1510759854
ChrizC,Every website on the Internet is the same!,"For some reason, this memory just came flooding back to me, so now I'm here to share it with you. This was about 3 years ago now. 

Context: I worked for *large UK retailer* providing support for their online grocery ordering site over the phone. Majority of our calls were forgotten passwords and missing emails. We had a bunch of steps that fixed the issue 99% of the time. 

It's worth mentioning at this point that, like a lot of major companies, we had an obnoxious IVR that had way too many options. All of the options were named after the company. 

&gt;*beep beep*  
&gt;**ChrizC**: Good morning, *large UK retailer* technical support, *ChrizC* speaking, how can I help?  
&gt;**Old Caller (OC)**: Good morning young man! I'm trying to login to my account, but I can't remember my password, and I'm not getting an email to reset it! 

Not a problem, easy enough. We try fix number 1.

Nothing. 

Fix 2? Nope. 

Fixes 3 through 7? Nada. 

At this point, I'd tried everything. I even sent him a test email from our email system. Absolutely zilch. 

I start thinking I'm gonna need to tell this guy he needs to start from scratch, with a new account. I offer to walk him through the process, as it turns out his grandson originally registered him. 

I ask him to click the link labelled ""Register a new *large UK retailer* account.""

&gt;**OC**: My button isn't blue, it's red!  
&gt;**ChrizC** *(wtf)*: Uhh, okay, can you do me a favour and tell me what's in the big white bar at the top of your screen?  
&gt;**OC**: Yep! It says... google.co.uk/mail!  
&gt;**ChrizC** *(realisation in 3, 2, 1)*: Sir, you *are* trying to login to your *large UK retailer* account, right?  
&gt;**OC**: No, I told you, I'm not getting my emails!  
&gt;**ChrizC**: Sir, you've called *large UK retailer*. If you can't get into your emails, I suggest you speak to Google directly.  
&gt;**OC**: Why can't you help me?!  
&gt;**ChrizC**: I don't work for Google. I have no access to their systems.  
&gt;**OC**: Why not?! Every website is the same! *(op note: later discovered this meant because he used the same password everywhere, every website had the same account, so I should be able to reset it once and it'd work anywhere)*  
&gt;**ChrizC**: I'm sorry, sir, but I don't work for Google. You'll have to speak to them to gain access to your emails.

MAlloc-1024,Here's how I broke the cardinal rule about never pissing off the HR department...,"For backstory, I am the Tech Support, Network and Server manager.

Edit: additional information: Per policy, the IT department doesn't support 3rd party SaaS products unless it has an installed component, like office 365. We do support our homegrown SaaS products.

----------------------------


$Hr: $malloc, we need tech support for &lt;SaaS Product&gt;. The videos are not playing.

$malloc: I've never heard of it.

$Hr: Here is a link to it and your login. Why are videos not working?

$malloc: Ok I see it is a third party SaaS application... Call their tech support.

$Hr: Our go live was this morning. We need it working now. No on on your team can help.

$malloc: Who is your project implementer? I've never heard of this project or product, so I can verify that no one reached out to the Support department to offer us training.

$Hr: It's a website... You handle tech support for our websites.

$Malloc: My team and I receive training from our software development team for our websites. In addition, if there is a problem I can reach out to software development for help. Since you and or your project implementer are presently the only ones with any knowledge of this project/product, call their tech support.


...time passes...


$Hr: Their tech support says they need us to turn off add-blocking and it only works on windows 7 using Internet Explorer with Adobe Flash.

$Malloc: Since everyone on your team uses windows 10 I'm guessing that this is a problem.

$HR: yes, please resolve

$Malloc: Stop using &lt;SaaS product&gt; since it is in violation of our company IT security policy if you do revert back to windows 7 or install Adobe Flash. Really how are you going live today if you never tested this?

$HR: that is not a resolution. We have already paid for &lt;SaaS Product&gt;

$Malloc: Per company policy &lt;number.number&gt; any new software purchase must be approved by the IT department. Can you produce that approval?

Universal_Binary,"""Your Internet link is down."" ""That might be because it's on fire.""","This is my all-time favorite interaction with tech support.

Late one December evening a number of years ago, I got an unexpected call from my boss.  He said there was a fire at the office, and I might want to come in and see what was going on.

So I did.  By the time I got there, the fire was on its way out, and I and a couple dozen others were standing around in the parking lot waiting for the firefighters to give us the all-clear to enter the building.

We had Internet service through an awesome local ISP at the time.  The kind of small company that really cared about service.

While I was shivering next to a fire truck, my cell phone rang.  It was one of their techs, whom I had shared on office with at a different company years ago and knew well.

&gt; Me: Hello?

&gt; Tech: Hi, this is $TECH from $ISP.  Just wanted to let you know that our monitoring noticed your Internet link is down, and we're working on it.

&gt; Me: That might be because it's on fire.

Long pause.  Then:

&gt; Tech: Did you just say it's on fire?

&gt; Me: Yeah, there was a fire in the building.  I'm standing next to a fire truck right now.  They aren't letting us in yet.

Then, without missing a beat, $TECH said something he *never* said at that ISP (remember, premium service):

&gt; Tech: Ah, well OK then.  I'll assume the problem is on your end.  *click*

Despite the cold and the uncertainty (how badly damaged was the office, etc), I couldn't help laughing at the absurdity of it all.

----

Because $ISP was awesome, less than 5 minutes later he called back to say, ""I just checked, and we have two portable generators that aren't in use right now.  If you need them, just say the word, and I can have them there in 2 hours, any time, day or night.  No charge.""  Our contract with them had nothing in it about generators.",talesfromtechsupport,6945,1510667462
EpiphanyOfThings,Tale about a girl who stored her files on the monitor,"So few years ago we were swapping monitors for some of the employees who where still using CRT, so everyone can get a fancy flat one. Each of them was asked if they need help with plugging it in or taking care of the old one - most of them said they can handle it, some of them not but they ususally called for help eventually (which was totally fine with me).

But there was this one lady, the corpo-bitch style. Always high heels, always pristine make-up and clothes and speaking in a manner like she was the queen of her suburbs. And of course you first smelled her parfumes and then saw her. It was easy to determine if she was passing by in the last 10 minutes even if you're not a trained police dog.


Anyway, she comes to pick up her brand new LCD Dell monitor. I'm asking as usual:

&gt;- Hey, you'll need any help with that?


&gt;- You think I can't handle such a simple task? I didn't get this job for nice looks.


&gt;- Umm... sure ok, just call us if any assist is needed.


&gt;- Pfff


The next day The CB is storming into our office and says that she *demands her previous monitor*. 

&gt;- Umm, it is somewhere in the IT-shack but why would you need that?


&gt;- YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME THAT I NEED TO COPY ALL MY FILES SOMEWHERE BEFORE THE SWAP OR I CAN LOSE THEM!


&gt;- No... it's impossible.


&gt;- Yeah? You think so? So come and see for yourself. And give me back my f* monitor.


Well, so I went over to her place to see what the hell could've happened. And so I see her monitor in 1028x768 resolution overcrowded with icons like a club on a Saturday Night.

&gt;- Ok, so I've asked you if you'll need any help and **you've said no**.


&gt;- *brlahg bghhh lalgllgghgghhgh* (basically spitting out some stuff about her being the most competent person in the existence of human kind and my fault that I didn't warn her about the data loss)


&gt;- **switching resolution to native** So your files are still there, next time just say that you need help with the setup and we'll help you.


&gt;- Just go already and let me get back to my work.



Yeah, and so it is. In the meantime she also said that maybe we don't want to give her the monitor back because we're stealing the data to sell it to our competitors. Sure thing, one cent per kilobyte on papertowels and plastic cups usage. Did I mention that she was just a team leader for a maintenance team?",talesfromtechsupport,3058,1510586354

The characters:

$boss: 30ish woman, and man, could she be a dragon. (A nice one, but still a dragon.)

$coworker: nice 40ish go-to-woman. Got a question? Ask $coworker. Biggest help on my project so far.

$bigBoss: the uber-boss. 40-something, comes from Greece, has an accent and is chilled like no-one I've ever met.

$newBoss: By then, I lost overview a tiny bit. He's another boss, but not the boss of $boss, but still pretty important? I never figured it out.

$ITwannabe: The IT guru. Though how much he actually did in IT and programming, I never found out. Was not much, that I can tell.

________________


So here I am, trying to fuse a lot of stuff into my application which I do not want in there, making links and corrolating data. I give it my best - I truly do - but it still sucks. By now, I am already way behind the planned schedule; $boss had me make another updated one and it does not look good in any way. I am now about a month behind what I am supposed to achieve.


$boss is also back by now (finally!) and has me do another round of data reflection. She comes up with the phenomenal idea that if a lot of the key values in our data source are the same, I should search for other key values. In this case - dates. So what I do now is to try to get only the ""newest"" entries into our database and have us work with them. Problem is, I still have not figured out a nice flag to get the right project data into our DB, since the meatgrinder does not give even a tiny fuck about my problems. He is a meatgrinder, after all - he takes everything, munches it up and vomits out an incredible mess, which is all and every project ever conceived in this here department.


My solution: Have the application copy everything (since it is way faster in Access to just copy the data into a temporary table and work with that than to try to request the right values one by one from the DB) and mess around with that. By now (which is about one week later), I only have a few duplicates left - since they have the same dates.


While I do this, $newBoss starts harrassing me. He wants this, he wants that, and he wants it NOW. He is still nice about this, but I gather from the flood of emails he is sending me that he gets impatient.


Time to load the dragon.


&gt; $me: Hey $boss! I got a little problem here.

&gt; $boss: Hey $win4free! Sure, what's up?

&gt; $me: See, the problem is $newBoss. He wants a lot of stuff in the application, it really slows me down. Not only do I still not have the data he wants, but every time I have a few fields implemented, he comes up with a few other ones.

&gt; $boss: All right, I'll have a talk with him.


Yeah, I still have no data for $newBoss. $ITwannabe has shot me down a few times by now, saying that he will get around to me the moment he has some spare time from his project (which, I remind you, is more or less the same as mine, but way more fancier and with a few people working on it instead of just poor ol' me.) I am getting frustrated by now.


So, the same day, $boss pays a little visit to $newBoss. I can hear the screaming coming down the floor when the dragon unfolds her wings and starts breathing fire all over the place. As any man with a sense of self-preservation would do, I keep my head down and just continue working.


$boss comes around an hour later and tells me not to worry about anything, just to get on with my job and finish the application so we can finally start testing. All of testing up to this point has been done by me and $coworker, but since the application is supposed to be deployed in the whole country, we need to do some additional testing about connection and stuff like that.


A few minutes after $boss has left, I get another mail.


&gt; Dear $win4free,

&gt; These are the new fields I need: *yaddayadda*. Please disregard the fields *moreyadda* since I will not need them.


Dear RNGesus. This is the fifth time he has me include fields which one day later he does not want anymore. Seems he is fire-proof, too.


I ask $coworker to bring the good news to our dragon overlord (yeah, I am not the bravest person - time to throw another person to the fiery fire) and a few minutes later, the heat is on.


I get another email. Meeting with $bigBoss.


Seems like our dragon overlord has applied to our Greek dragon emporer.


I come in a bit early as always, and $bigBoss greets me with a big smile.


&gt; $bigBoss: Hey $win4free! How's it going? How are you doing in school?

&gt; $win4free: Fine, thanks. Know what this meeting is about?

&gt; $bigBoss: Nah, just about some dispute between $boss and $newBoss. But that's talk for later. My kids! They want to study, too, so tell me a bit about this computer science thingy you are doing.


We drink coffee, I tell him half of my life story, we laugh a lot. Then the bosses arrive.


&gt; $bigBoss: So, tell me what this is all about.

&gt; $newBoss: Well, the application has a lot of data I need and -

&gt; $boss: No it doesn't, it does only if $win4free keeps adding field after field for which we still have no data available!

&gt; $newBoss: Well, YOU told me it wouldn't be a problem!

&gt; $boss: A few fields, yes! Not a shitton of them!


This goes on and on. I sit right across to $bigBoss, who, from time to time, sips his coffee and lets the show continue with every sign of enjoyment. Also, from time to time, we exchange a glance, smirk and sip some more black programming soup.


Finally, the Greek dragon awaiks.


&gt; $bigBoss: All right, settle down. $win4free, tell me your side of the story.

&gt; $win4free: Well, it's like this: I am already behind schedule. The more I have to implement, the longer it will take to roll out the application. Simple as that.

&gt; $bigBoss: Right. $newBoss, how much more stuff will you need in there? Oh, and have you finished the matrix, $win4free?

&gt; $win4free: Yeah, matrix is almost finished.

&gt; $newBoss: I don't know, really. My guys come up with other stuff from time to time -

&gt; $bigBoss: Well, than make sure to gather all the other stuff, thin it out, only get what you need, and send it to $win4free when you have everything.

&gt; $win4free: Biggest problem still is the data itself. I have no chance to get to it. $ITwannabe is heads deep in his own project and cannot assist me, really.

&gt; $bigBoss: Well, than $newBoss will have to fill it out himself.


I smirk.


&gt; $newBoss: How much would that be?

&gt; $win4free: Well, we're counting about 50 projects so far.

&gt; $newBoss: And I have to fill out every field I request?

&gt; $win4free: Yah.


The Greek dragon smirks.


&gt; $newBoss: Okay... yeah, I better thin out them fields.

&gt; $bigBoss: Great! Back to work, then! Oh, $win4free, do you have a few more minutes?

&gt; $win4free: Sure, whatever you need.


We continue drinking coffee and talking about studying for about half an hour in which $bigBoss starts venting about his son, who does not seem to have any clue what to study, just that he wants to study *something*. When I return to my workplace, $coworker gives me an upraised eyebrow.


&gt; $coworker: So, how did it go?

the_silent_one1984,Had to fly to customer site to install software,"This was from several years ago. We produce custom desktop software for customers. These particular customers were especially tech illiterate and didn't even have an IT department to speak of despite being a major manufacturing corporation (anonymized, but you've heard of them for sure).

Our software is nothing super crazy: download our run-of-the-mill installer, open it, and click next a few times and you're done. Sure, there are advanced options but most people would be fine with the defaults.

Support had a problem with three people trying to install. No amount of ""click next"" was getting through to them. They were seriously questioning the advanced options they thought they had to set, and talking them out of changing the defaults was an exercise in futility.

Them: It is asking for a path to install.

Support: Just leave it be. Click next.

Them: But what do I put for the path?

Support: What is it set to now?

Them: See two dots diagonal line program files diagonal--

Support: That is the correct path. Click next.

Them: But I should set the path, shouldn't I?

This circular conversation went nowhere... Finally, the customer had a great idea.

Them: ""Can you send someone out here to help us?""

Support: ""The nearest person is 500 miles away.""

Them: ""We will pay whatever expenses it takes. We just have to get this thing installed before tomorrow.""

Next thing I knew I was boarding an airplane bound for their city.

2 hours later I was at their office... 20 minutes after that, hitting next a total of 6 times (3 for each luser), I was done. The application worked fine. They drove me back to the airport where I came back home that night.

The only good thing was they dutifully paid the thousand-odd bucks for the flight plus premium hourly cost.

TL;DR: Customer spent &gt;$1,000 to have a qualified tech do the equivalent of hiring a mechanic to unlock your car using your key.

hahkaymahtay,Why did you shut our website down?,"Long time lurker, first time poster, etc. Excuse my formatting.  

I am not the IT guy in our office but I do share a table with him (open office plan) and generally know my way around computers.  

Just a bit of a background, I work for an educational company that publishes an online reading magazine. We have tech-illiterate bosses who didn't understand why we couldn't develop a videogame for our students every week and once asked me to start emailing our tweets to our followers.  

About 3 months ago, our website randomly goes down one day. Immediately, $clickity receives a call from our boss who is irate.  
&gt;$clickity-Yes, I'm looking into it now.  
&gt;$boss-WHY WOULD YOU TAKE OUR SITE DOWN!!!! FIX IT NOW!  
&gt;$clickity-I didn't take it down, it looks like the domain has expired. Did you happen to receive any emails about this? Did you or $otherboss  sign up for this domain? There is probably some information in one of your emails.  
&gt;$boss-No! I don't know what you're talking about, you just need to fix it now!  

He hangs up and $clickity does some investigating. Whose name is registered to this domain? $boss of course! So he calls back...  
  
&gt;$clickity-$boss, looks like this domain is registered to your name. Are you sure you didn't get any emails asking you about this?  
&gt;$boss-No! I would have noticed. Why haven't you fixed it yet?!  

Goes back and forth like this until $boss FINALLY remembers that yes, he did in fact handle the domain business last year.  

Instead of asking $boss to search his emails, $clickity goes to his computer and does it himself. But...there are 0 emails in relation to the domain. What? $boss' name is on the account. $clickity calls back.  
&gt;$clickity-I can't find any email on here...did you sign up using another email address?  
&gt;$boss-What? Why would I do that?  
(long pause)
&gt;$boss-Wait, maybe I did.  

We are all dying on the inside.  

&gt;$clickity-Cool, with what email?  
&gt;$boss-I don't know.  
 
The problem is, we can't re-up the domain without going through the numerous re-activation emails that have, presumably, been sent to this email address.  
After a long back and forth with $boss, he finally remembers the email but of course! *he doesn't remember the password to the email*  
After walking $boss through the password reactivation process, we're in!  

Finally! $clickity is in and what greets him? Emails going back a *year* asking $boss if he wants to re-new the domain. Facepalms all around. $clickity took control of the account after this.  

The craziest part? When $boss came to the office later that day, he sits down with $clickity telling him how irresponsible $clickity was and how he can't let it happen again.  
Total time of life lost? About 3 hours. 

TLDR; Boss forgot to re-up our domain, forgot account details, and then blamed everything on someone who had nothing to with the issue.

Password resets: we've all done them, and we all know how much fun they can be. To simplify workflow, some of my users use PINs instead of passwords for rapid data entry. For the most part, the PIN-based users never need to use their password unless they have to do training, and their PIN rarely if ever changes.

&gt; **$AB:** I'm calling from $loc for $NP. She's trying to login to *the system* and is getting a message saying ""Account is Disabled""

*Note: The main login errors for our in-house software are ""Invalid Credentials"" and ""Your Account has been Locked."" Knowing our change management, or lack thereof, it's not impossible that ""Account is Disabled"" is a valid error, but it's unlikely.* **Strike 1**

&gt; **$EM:** OK, well I see that $NPs account is active, and the password was just recently set. I also see that they're a PIN-only user. Is this error happening on a PIN-User's $Pane10 tab, or a $PIN-only kiosk?

&gt;**$NP:** It's *&lt;4 digit number&gt;*

*Finally, something that I can work with.*

&gt;**$EM:** OK, I'm in the machine. This is definitely a $PIN-Kiosk, not a $FlightlessBird. What exactly are you trying to do?

&gt;**$NP:** Well, when I put in my code, the system won't take my letters. 

*YouDontSay.gif*

&gt;**$EM:** That's because this type of unit needs your PIN, not your password. 

*Proceeds to key user's username into the appropriate field.*

&gt;OK, now key in your PIN

*Dear gods, please don't make me have to move these fruitcakes to a desktop so she can do a password reset...*

*$NP proceeds to correct enter her username and password and receives the error ""Your PIN has not been setup.""*

&gt;**$EM:** OK, looks like you've never used the PIN-Only system before. Let's click on the ""New User"" button instead. 

*$NP proceeds to login to the ""Create PIN and set Security Questions"" page in the Kiosk app, and create her PIN*

Disco_Killer,The tale of the drunken amateur...,"Greetings. LTL, FTP, SFTP, STFU, TTFN, WWW., HTTPS, IMEI, ISBN, RHCP. 

I am by no means tech support, I have been payroll software support (which mainly consisted of saying things like: ""It is wrong because you keyed it in wrong... no, if our software was wrong then our other customers would be saying the same thing..."" a lot) in the past but that is as close as I have flirted with TS in the traditional sense. I am now a systems engineer for an e-commerce company and deal exclusively with cloud based tech, mainly keeping the site up and running and facilitating code deployment. It's been an odd career progression which obviously took in a bit of software testing along the way.

In my spare time, pre wife and child, I used to enjoy building my own PCs etc. Still do... there's just a lot longer between ""upgrades"" these days. I've built PCs for people in the past, some grateful, some not so much (my brother could be a bit of a d1ck). While I think I know what I am doing, I am by no means a professional. 

This tale of mediocre diagnostic skill occurred many years ago while I was still in university. I was attending a soirée at a friend's house (see: balls to the wall drinking binge, we didn't know any other way) when my ex-girlfriend (who happened to live with my friends.. and to be fair was still a friend... it was just a bit weird) staggered over and in her finest Bristolian accent asked:

&gt;**$EXGF**: ""'Ere!, my computer doesn't work, can you fix it?"". 
&gt;       
&gt;**$Me**: ""yesh... I can havsh a looknning..."" - I said, half into a mostly consumed can of warm, horrible lager and half towards her blurry face. 

We wandered through the house where a mainly naked girl tottered by desperate for attention from literally anyone and some other people were playing tekken and drinking shots of sambuca each time they lost. I hear the childish whoops of merriment as water balloons were hurled at passers-by from an upstairs window. The place stank of poppers, weed, stale alcohol and water damage from the time one of the lads managed to pull a radiator off the wall. What a time to be alive. 

We retire to her sleeping quarters (see: absolute mess of a bedroom) and I press the power button for the PC... starts up... nothing on the screen... stays running... makes the usual ""I am getting information from the hard drive to load up your OS"" noises... no POST... no clicking... no burning smell... Still nothing on the screen. What the? Maybe this wasn't a ploy to get me into her bedroom after all... 

I check the connection between tower and monitor. I check the power cable to the monitor... all fine. The plot thickens... 

Maybe it's a broken monitor... I press the power button to switch off the monitor, then again to switch it back on, it does give some sort of indication that it is working by way of a splash screen or something... not the monitor then... she produces another VGA cable:

&gt;**$EXGF**:""Ere! The man at the shop said to try this, but it hasn't helped. He said to bring it in if it didn't work and he would fix it but you know how to fix computers so I thought I would ask you first""

I am impressed by her endeavor, the kind chap at the local computer shop had given her the cable free of charge too. I almost feel bad for taking his potential customer away from him. 

I survey the tower and the PC appears to be a budget machine likely built from the cheapest possible components by **$PCGLOBE** (a large UK based tech retailer which has since merged with another large UK based tech retailer to form **$MERGEDLARGEUKBASEDTECHRETAILER**... I digress) then sold as ""Going to university"" computers aimed at new students. All very basic stuff, low end processor, just enough RAM to run the OS and write an essay in word, Half a gig HD, floppy drive and about 2/3 USB ports on the all-in-one board... wait a minute... Clearly the 'puter is loading up, it sounds happy enough, but it isn't displaying anything... and this is an on-board GFX card... 

In the past I had built my own PC with a board like this, I'd never experienced this kind of issue before but I did have a hunch.

I ask for a screwdriver. I am handed a screwdriver. Why the hell did I break up with this woman? She thinks for herself, she's done basic troubleshooting, actually has a small toolkit on hand... oh wait yeah, she is utterly mental... Halcyon days like I say. 

&gt;**$EXGF**: ""'Ere! [yes, she started every sentence like that... at least that is how I remember her speaking], are you sure you know what your doing?!""
&gt;
&gt;**$Me**: ""Of course I do...**BURRP** ... you can trusht me"" I replied with a smile... 

I pry open the case (after switching off and disconnecting the power of course, I was drunk not an idiot) and head straight for the CMOS battery. I prize it out from its little clip. Hold it aloft and say a magic spell along the lines of ""Izzy whizzy let's get busy"" while waiting for any remaining current to drain from the board (the hallowed 10 seconds), put the battery back in, plug the machine back in and switch it on. Hey presto! Windows is loading. I know this because it says so on the monitor. 

&gt;**$EXGF**: ""ERE!!! What the fXXk?! What did you dooo?!! You're amazing, oh my god DiscoKiller have my babies!!"" Or something like that... Except obviously not that as I had broken up with her a few weeks prior. 

&gt;**$Me**: ""well the problem was that your graphicshh are on-board and what I did was..."" **her eyes glaze over** ""... magic. I did some magic. Can I go and get another beer now? the last 15 are wearing off.. I fancy a game of tekken.."" -- side note: I was shit at Tekken. 

I'd figured something had gone awry with the graphics settings which were governed by the BIOS, and given we couldn't see anything on the monitor, the only way to get them to reset to default would be to remove the power supply from the CMOS so it forgot how to be broken. There's probably a technical term for that. 

I was inordinately proud of my skills that day - still am. Certainly in the haze of drunkenness from which my eureka moment sprang. 

TL;DR: computer with on-board GFX wasn't displaying stuff... removed CMOS battery, replaced CMOS battery, computer with on-board GFX now displaying stuff.

RedPalenciaTUM,I ain't kidding,"Hello TFTS! This is a short story (more of a joke than an actual story) but I guessed I could draw a smile in your faces.  
  
So this all happened when I worked for a certain ISP as a tier 2 Tech support representative, frankly I don't know a lot about computers but I kind of defend myself as I have general knowledge about how things work and why they work that way (also, you guys are awesome teachers). Anyway, when It came down to modems, routers and internet speeds I was quite good at troubleshooting since all you have to do is follow some simple formulas of **IF--&gt;THEN** and with a lot of bad luck (got very weird cases), some google-fu and a miserable training I'd like to say I gave good, competent and even above average call support.  
  
Now, this is where it gets funny: The *site* was/is located in beautiful Mexico City, and I as a Spanish speaker and born in the language have a rather difficult name to pronounce that let's just say is in ""Nahuatl"" so as soon as I started taking English calls it was quite obvious to me that it would be best for me to change my name, and so, I became known as Sirius and presented myself as that at the beginning of every call.  

  
See where this is going?  
  
So, insert Angry Gringo Customer *$AGC*, and *$Me* with a problem of intermittent connection in a very saturated area at the end of the call.
   
&gt;*$Me:* Well, as I was saying sir it seems that you have an intermittence problem and the only way we can fix this is by sending a Tech over to check your connections.  
&gt;*AGC:* But I need this now! I know you can fix it from the phone, they have done that before and I have even have Tech visits scheduled and canceled them since the service was restored!  
&gt;*$Me:* Yes, indeed sir, as I said before the problem you have means that sometimes the internet will work perfectly fine but then suddenly drop its speed or fall death altogether, right now we checked if you have splitters, your physical connections and I even tried my best to configure your wifi since you don't want to use wires to squeeze out every single Mb out of your 3Mb package, but to permanently fix this we need a tech.  
&gt;*$AGC:* But you're the Tech!  
&gt;*$Me:* I mean a Tech on the site, sir.  
&gt;*$AGC:* OK, but the previous Tech I had scheduled was for tomorrow, I'll need him to be here by five since I work from home and I'm losing money!!!  
&gt;*$Me:* Since you cancelled that appointment even though you were told you shouldn't I can't guarantee We'll have the date available but I'll do my best to get you an appointment as soon as I can.  
&gt;*$AGC:* You better do! I'm tired of this **THING**!!!!  
&gt;*$Me* Well the soonest I have available is *insert date a week from the day of the call*.  
&gt;*$AGC:* WHAT!!!??? I AM PAYING GOOD MONEY FOR THAT SERVICE *(he wasn't)* AND I'VE BEEN A LOYAL CX WITH YOU FOR 20 YEARS *(also not)* AND I EVEN HAVE HAD A GOOD HISTORY *(strike three, you're out!)*, YOU HAVE TO GET ME A BETTER DATE!!!  
&gt;*$Me:* Sir, while you were speaking it seems that someone has already taken the available space I offered you. Right now I have this *Insert even farthest away date* for the appointment, would you like to schedule it right now to secure it?  
&gt;*AGC:* You're **SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING** KIDDING!!  
  
....  
  
&gt;*$Me:* No sir! I'm Sirius!  
  

  
  
  
TLDR: trying to schedule an appointment for an angry cx turns to be a golden opportunity to make a good old fashioned daddy joke.  
  
Edit: grammar and spelling, sorry if it is far from perfect but not native speaker. Any feedback is appreciated.

EmersonEsq,"""No, we never learned where those servers are.""","(Go easy on me, it's my first post.)

I've been working TS for a DLP solution for about two years now. Plenty of simple day to day stuff, plus plenty of muting my phone and asking aloud ""oh god, how are you in charge of IT for a [major corporate or government agency]?"" This one from last week though, it definitely isn't the dumbest or craziest thing I have heard but, it has been on my mind for days. 

$client calls in. He has been tasked with updating their entire system from our 2014 version of our solution to our most recent. Nothing out of the ordinary. We have a management server, some supplemental servers, web proxy appliances, and three mail appliances to take care of. Things went sideways at first, which leads me to get the call. Soon, we are working through those machines in the order I just listed them. When the last proxy is booted and ready to go, I turn my attention to the mail appliances. Then I get to take part in this conversation:

&gt; $Me: Okay, so it looks like the last proxy is ready to go. Time to turn our attention to the mail machines. 

&gt; $client: Great. I have a PuTtY session open to the first one on my left screen. Can you see it?

&gt; $Me: Yep. Given the version your other machines were on, I need to double check some things on this box before we go any further. 

&gt; [*I do a quick once-over on the machine and quickly recognize that this machine, and presumably it's two siblings, will need to be completely re-imaged to in order to take our new version.*]

&gt; $Me: Yep, these servers are not running on the kernel we need for our most recent versions. We are going to need to re-image them, whole process is pretty simple. You can grab a USB image off our download site and--

&gt; $client: No, that... we can't do that. 

&gt; $Me: Like I said, it is a pretty simple process. I am happy to talk you through anything that--

&gt; $client: No, it isn't that. I don't have access to those servers. 

&gt; $Me: Well, I am happy to work with whoever handles your physical servers and get this issue resolved. 

&gt; $client: No... I handle the machines... we never learned where those servers are... Our entire IT team was turned over in the last year and we inherited this setup. Despite our trying, we were never able to find those boxes and have just been dealing with them remotely. 

&gt; $Me: ...

&gt; $client: We have checked every building we have access to. We know what every box does that we can find. We don't know where those boxes are. Honestly, at this point, I can't ask where they are. It wouldn't look good for me. 

&gt; $Me: Well, to upgrade these boxes, you are going to need physical access. 

&gt; $client: Well, can they work in their current version with the updated software?

&gt; $Me: It isn't something that is QA'd or suggested. You will have some issues with backwards compatibility on all systems older than vX.X with those vY.Y and above. 

&gt; $client: Well, that's just great. I'll figure it out, I guess.

I get a little irritated at her raising her voice and say “you are definitely NOT locked out...are you using a laptop or a desktop?”....turns out, she’s using a PERSONAL laptop that has nothing to do with the company...meaning if she were locked out, I have absolutely no way of unlocking it. I tried to explain to her that her laptop is not on the same domain or network as the company so I cannot unlock her...she gets infuriated and demands that she speak to my manager, or as she put it “someone that knows what they’re doing”.

He runs all excited to me and wants to show me a picture on his phone. He zooms in and scrolls to the left. I see a kitchen. HE scrolls a little to the right and I see cake and coffee.

Devilotx,10 Million Dollars worth of Schematics and Windows 98.,"Reading though some TFTS Today as I'm supporting a meeting reminded me of this old gem.  Let me take you back to late 2002 / early 2003.

I was doing contract work for a fabrication company in Massachusetts that makes nose cones for the space shuttles.  This was not their primary business, but none the less, walking through the plant floor and seeing these giant sheets of metal being heated up and slowly bent into a cone was pretty impressive.

Through this company, I became very skilled in CAD workstation setups, Getting the nice fireGL cards for the engineers, muli-monitor workstations, massive (at the time) amounts of RAM.  Even got to play with the 3DLabs Wildcat cards.

This company had a number of pieces of hardware / software still running, including an old VAX stuck in a small room that ran a design database. (This is how I got in the door, yay VAX).

However this tail regards a single machine, and old Gateway PC that is setup in the corner, running windows 98 2nd Edition on an old CRT Monitor.  This machine is not online, this machine was only used to bring up old designs and print them to a local planner printer.

Now, the explanation I received was that the software was proprietary and obsolete.  The Company who created it had long since gone out of business.  The designs could not be ported to new software, they would have had to be completely redone in new modern software. 

But at least they had the installer CD with Serial, but the software would not run on Windows XP, leaving it regulated to this old P2 hardware.  

However, this machine has started crashing, more and more, and they are getting nervous, the data is backed up, and hasn't changed in years and while they don't use or need this machine often, they no longer trust it.

So, after much discussion, talking with the finance team, discussing with my co-workers, we decide on a simple course of action.  We purchase a nice new Dell Dimension desktop, P4 with 256 MB of Ram, we get it, we wipe Windows XP and reinstall Windows 98 SE.  surprisingly the hunt for drivers wasn't that bad I recall, I know we did have some minor issues with finding some, including have to grab some hacked driver for a dodgy site, but hey, sometimes you have to do things you don't want. 

So, Windows is installed, the updates that can be installed are, we connect to the planner and install the design software and it goes without a hitch, launch the software, go through the config, point to the data for the designs and open.....

Crash - Random error message

Try again - Crash

check setup vs the working PC, the same, ok, slightly different, so I move the designs to the exact same folder structure as on the old PC instead of the logical place I've saved it, Same result, Software launches, Software Crashes.

Google as it was, was useless, this software was apparently not well loved, not often used and info on it in general is scarce.  The Error messages bring up issues for other pieces of software, but not this one (Sorry, I don't recall the name... I wanna say FireCad, but It's been so long). 

So I drag out another monitor, and I've got them hooked up, side by side. ok, Hard drive is bigger on the new PC, I hope that's not the answer, the old PC had 128 MB, so I strip out the 256 MB chip and drop in 128 MB, no change, same crash.  Mouse? Keyboard? Monitor? I swap everything that was hooked to the old PC to the new one, still crash.  Screen resolution is identical, everything looks right.

We start going through the software, we track down and install old versions of Winzip, we install the old version of Java that the old machine has, we start going through the updates, removing the updates from the new machine so they are patch identical.

Still Crashing, still failing... 

We audit again, each step we are one to one as exact as humanly possible.  At this point we start thinking about repairing the old PC as this is seemingly a failure.

I'm sitting back in a chair, just looking at these 2 CRT Monitors, I've even put the same shortcuts on the desktop, just in case.  Short of shaking the magical bag of chicken bones, I'm stumped.

I'm sipping my coffee and looking at this screens, from one to the other, from one to the other. Back and forth.... same wallpaper, same icons, maybe it's the P4? It's a big jump from P2 to P4, maybe it's some errata? 

Back and forth, digging into my eyes, something I'm missing, something stupid, these things are always something stupid.

hmmm, does that IE logo look better on the new one? I scoot closer, maybe it's my imagination, I look at other logos, everything on the new one looks a minuscule bit better to me.

Display properties, same Resolution.

Color Depth.... different

Old PC is 16bit, new PC is 32Bit.

Flip the new one down to 16Bit color, launch the program.

Success.

This software was so old that 32 bit color depth crashed it.  something so minute, so insignificant caused so much pain. 

I hope that in the following years they moved away from that, or virtualized it, but I lost touch, but the company is still around, still going strong, and I wonder if my little Dimension is in there chugging away.

TL;DR - Old Software can't handle the full color spectrum. ",talesfromtechsupport,2529,1509623360
StopShoe,Not your usual OS,"So this just happened, and I still can't believe it. 


I get a call today from a very nice lady who doesn't speak much English. Basically all I get out of her is ""it no work"" and how she's had it for 20 years and needs an upgrade. Of course, this is what all of them say and I have learned to just ignore it. But this time is different. 


I try to remote in using our usual software to no avail. So I try our software that works on Win XP, (yes we still have almost 60% of our computers running XP, with a DC running server 2003) and I am able to remote in, although it does take quite a while to load up. I start poking around and noticed that something was off. The windows theme had been set to (what I thought) was windows classic, and I assumed this was done to help performance.


Wrong. 

Icons look different, and certain options that appear when right clicking are not showing anymore. Odd, so I go to the control panel, and then the system icon. I find that she is running on Windows 98.


Astounded, I ask her if she remembers who got her this computer, and she tells me it was given to her when she first started, back in 1999. Her and one other lady run a remote location, and they are the only 2 who work there. I check their ticket history, and they don't have a single ticket logged since 2011 (when our ticket system was implemented. The average user has at least 20 forgotten password tickets) Normally when somebody has an ""older"" computer we do our best to just clean it out and maybe add some RAM. But because of the age of this machine, I immediately imaged a computer running on Windows 7 and shipped it to her, with a return label to send back the gem. I also asked her what kind of computer her co-worker has, and she says it is the same model as the one giving problems, but hers is working ""fine"". I also ship her co-worker a new computer as well. 


Now I was born in the 90s, and we didn't have our first computer until 2002 or 2003. I have never seen anything older than windows XP. I am seriously interested in seeing this thing in person. I didn't think about getting the specs off the computer, and I want to be surprised when I get it. The IT staff have all placed bets on how much RAM and hdd space it has. I say 128mb but what do I know?


TL;DR: Lady calls because her computer is slow, turns out it is the same computer she started with, back in 1999. Running windows 98. Her co-worker has the same model.

rainwulf,Teamviewer number? I dont understand,"Got a call this morning, server is not working at a clients about 1000km away. Unable to access the data drive. Ok.. so i ask the girl for the teamviewer ID of her workstation. She reads the one on the sticker but i know this particular machine had a hardware upgrade and its changed the teamviewer number. 

So I say, can you open the program and get me the new number.

""What program?""
""Teamviewer"" I say, ""down near the clock.""
""I dont understand what you want""

huh

So she goes and gets another person who then gives me the teamviewer number on HER pc.. ok. fine.

I log in, and the laptop is connected to the neighbours wifi, and thus can't access the server. Hence the call in the first place. AHH facepalm...

Soo. I ask her for the teamviewer number of a machine that IS connected to the network. So she goes over and turns the first PC on...

Ahhhhhhh it wasn't even turned on. Too many damn people assume that i can connect with teamviewer if the internet is broken, or the machine is off.

Turns it on, and of teamviewer wont connect as there is no internet. So the server is actually down as well as the shitty router.

45 minutes have gone past now. I get them to plug a screen into the server (its esxi) and get them to power it off and back up again.

""Its not turning off""

what?

Ok, so we go to facetime. 

THEY ARE TRYING TO POWER THE ROUTER OFF. This is JUST after they had plugged the screen into the actual server.. jeez.

So i walk them through turning the server off and back on again. 
10 minutes later, all the virtual machines power up and its all ok.. but 1 whole fucking hour wasted.

This isnt the first time either that the laptop in this business had connected to the neighbours wifi instead (they know each other) and then rang up in an emergency and said ""CANT ACCESS THE SERVER""


edit: I found out today after all this that the server was in fact fine. They just used that one pc on the neighbours wifi to ""test"" it, and it failed so of they went to reboot the router, which of course didnt DO anything because they were just using this one PC to test it... fuck. That's when they started unplugging random things. It was at that point i said get the monitor because i didnt know what state anything was in. I have had to explain to them several times what the SERVER is. 

As to why this one laptop has the neighbouring building wifi is because every now and then the business owner takes the laptop to the other business. They know each other and work together.

Dragon is a speech recognition software the physicians use to document.

&gt;Me: Can you please check?  
&gt;UC: Ummm..... it says audio input not detected.  
&gt;Me: This typically means the microphone is not plugged in. Can you check and see if the microphone is plugged in?  

The tower is mounted underneath the desk and occasionally an employees foot gets snagged and something gets unplugged.

&gt;UC: *answers suspiciously quick* Yes it's plugged in.  
&gt;Me: Are you sure? the microphone wire goes through the back of the desk and is plugged in the back of the tower. Did you actually get down there and look?

JoeDanSan,Why do you need the admin password to wipe the disk?,"I was working IT in a large medical institution. When we had computers that were too broken to fix or too old, we send them to `$surplus` to deal with. It was expected that they were ensuring systems were properly wiped for HIPAA reasons. 

We had just sent a batch of computers from a training lab to them that we had locked down with DeepFreeze. For those of you that don't know, it basically restores the state of the computer every reboot. 

I get an unexpected call from them that goes like this:

    $surplus: Do you have the admin password to DeepFreeze

Then `$boss` takes the issue up with the `$CIO` and we are assured that they are doing the HIPAA thing correctly. We give them a few weeks to get back to us on it and they told us everything was good.

That did not ease my mind at all. On our next batch to `$surplus`, I configured two with a clean image, configured autologon, and added a call home script. Then we sent them off to be wiped out.

From the logs, I could tell that they powered them up for about 2 days. Then they went dark for about 3-4 weeks. Then they started calling home again but from IP addresses that I had not seen. Did a reverse lookup and discovered them to be from different residential providers. 

Then we presented the logs to `$CIO` showing my findings. It took about a week for those nodes to go dark. They had sold those computers to other employees. 

A week or so after that, all shipments of computers to `$surplus` were put on hold. That lasted for almost 4 months. When service resumed, we had to start destroying our own disks before they went to `$surplus`.  By the end of the year, 2 people retired from that department and several others left. It was almost a full staff turnover.

I have no idea how long this was going on, but all it took was one phone call asking the wrong question to the right person.",talesfromtechsupport,2117,1509422098
mydreamnotyours,"A Simple Issue Solved; Years Later, A Special Thank You","Years ago I worked as an entry-level tech at a large company. Basically, I did simple things and the stuff other people didn't think was worth their time.

One day a woman who works there sends a ticket for a computer that has caused an important document to disappear. Due to many employees over-using the term ""important"" this gets shuffled to me.

I make my way to her office only to find that it's not actually her work computer but her personal laptop that has made her important document disappear. 

Also, the important document that is missing is not for work, but is the manuscript for the 300 plus page novel she's written outside of work and for some reason she has only saved in one location.

I know that normally I'm not supposed to do anything with personal computers and certainly not if it has nothing to do with their actual work for the company, but since I'm there I agree to look at the laptop, which she has already booted up and sitting there ready for me.

She shows me that she can't open the document from the shortcut on the desktop and it's always worked before. I search for the actual file and can't find it. 

OK, back to this shortcut. Where is it located? On an external drive of some sort!

&gt;Me: Did you recently remove anything from this computer?

&gt;Her: Yeah! I took out the thing on the side because it was getting annoying. My mouse cord kept getting caught on it.

&gt;Me: Do you have it with you?

&gt;Her: Yeah. (fishes in purse) Here it is!

She hands me a back-then version of a USB drive. Like many back-then things, it was physically larger than our modern versions but storage space was of course smaller. 

She'd attached this still relatively small drive to what I can best describe as a long thin stick which I think was supposed to be some kind of novelty key chain.

Anyway, I get this monstrosity into the USB drive and click the shortcut and like magic her document begins to open (yes, begins is the appropriate word given its length and well, this was years ago so slower tech).

She is thrilled and profusely thanks me for recovering her ""lost"" document. 

I remove the giant stick thing and replace it with a company lanyard (since we had hundreds of extra company lanyards laying around for some reason). 

I also take a few extra minutes to show her how to save to her hard drive AND the external drive, and set up and explain a free online account where she can save the document just in case.

She is incredibly happy and can't thank me enough. I wink and tell her just don't tell anyone I was working on your personal computer and she smiles and agrees.

I go on about my day and in my time there I never interact with her again (remember, large company).

So it's now years later, I no longer work at the company in question, but I get an email from my old supervisor. Someone I'd helped while I was there wants to get in touch with me and is it OK to pass along my personal email? Sure.

A few days later I get an email from her. I'll summarize to make sure I don't give away anything I shouldn't and this stays anonymized. 

She recaps the day I helped her and apologizes, saying she now knows how computer illiterate she was back then. She says that her novel was published and sold quite well and without my help she probably would have lost the manuscript, as her external drive eventually got broken (!) but she had backup copies thanks to me. She asks for my mailing address because she wants to send me something. 

I reply and say some nice things and give her the information.

Several days later I get a package. It is a copy of her novel. On the title page inside it says ""To my computer angel, for helping make this possible."" And she signed it. 

Of course I sent her an email of thanks. The book is an incredibly good read, too.

TL;DR - I helped an employee solve a rather simple problem on her personal computer; years later she thanked me by sending me the work I helped save.",talesfromtechsupport,652,1509365882
farkanoid,"How avoiding a moral support request cost me a box of cookies, some AA batteries and potentially my soul","I don't know why I'm sharing this. I'm the stereotypical introverted ""nice guy"". I have a hard time saying no, and when I finally do, I'm riddled with guilt and kept awake at night.  

My client complained of low speeds on her ADSL2 connection, and claims to have called her service provider countless times. Within the next couple of weeks it progressed to complete drop-outs, which is when I was engaged to attend as a private contractor.

It was a simple call-out; I picked up her landline phone, tapped on the filter and heard static. Seen it a thousand times when there are outlets in kitchen settings (corrosion). Replaced the filter, problem solved, everybody happy.

A week later I receive a text asking if I was nearby, and if she could get a second opinion on an electrical problem she'd been having with some lighting. I replied advising that I'm no electrician, but that I'd be glad to come take a look to try and help her out.

By the time I arrive, there are already two electricians onsite looking as though they're about to have a stroke. The customer is holding a glass of wine and verbally laying into these poor guys. I introduced myself as a friend of the client and asked the electricians what happened.

They explained that they were doing some work on some garden lights that coincidentally happened to share the same power outlet as the water heater. For safety reasons, they unplugged the water heater while they completed their work, then plugged it back in to find that it's no longer heating.

For the record, this is an old 'Bosch' instant heater, which uses gas as the main energy source and a comparatively tiny bit of electricity to run the igniter circuitry and exhaust fan. Unplugging these units will not hurt them, and as the units are C-tick approved for use in Australia, you can bet on the fact that they're protected against the minor voltage spikes caused by disconnection/reconnection.

I found the diagnostics manual and discovered that the unit was failing its self-test (blower fan failure) - The fan was probably seized and being a 15+ year old unit, it was probably past its time and just died by coincidence.

The Electricians accepted responsibility as it happened on their watch, and advised that they'll credit up to $500 of the repair cost - They offered to arrange for a Bosch technician to attend the following day (Monday), which was clearly not good enough for the client. She continually berated them about being inexperienced, and warned them not to switch off their phones as she'll be in-touch.

I figure there was nothing more I could do, excused myself, and left as the client thanked me for my time.

A couple of hours later I receive another text begging me to attend again, as she's home alone with her grandson and there's a plumber onsite installing a new heater. I tell her to let him do his job, and not to engage him until he finishes. She insists, and I of course cave.

This time I find the customer outside smoking with her neighbour, and they're both very loudly berating the plumber, to the point where he can hear them from inside the premises. I walk into the house, introduce myself as the moral support guy, and before I could get another word out, the guy goes on a rant about how the customer is unappreciative and a b***, followed by other very colourful Australian expletives, at least one of which involved a sheep.

Turns out the warehouse was out of stock of the model of heater she wanted, and being a Sunday, all he could do was sell her a display model for a lower price with the same warranty.

The kicker is, the display unit he installed ended up being faulty (bad igniter), and now the customer is accusing him of trying to rip her off and calling him incompetent. So now the plumber owns the Electrician's fault.

Eventually, they all agreed on a brand new unit being installed the following day at 5:00PM

...Of course, the following day, at around midday, I receive a text asking if I could be home by 5:00PM. I replied with an apology, advising that I'm overbooked and won't finish work til 7PM.

The stars align to screw me. Two of my call-outs end up being cancelled and I finish at 3PM.

I live close to the client and can't risk going home in case I'm spotted, and there are four hours to go til 7PM. So I drive around aimlessly for the first hour, then I realise I really need to take a dump. I have severe public bathroom anxiety, but nature was calling very loudly at this point and I really didn't have a choice.

So I drive to my local McDonalds and I head to the bathroom to discover that it's closed due to a blockage. I fear I'll be judged for walking out without ordering anything, so I buy a box of cookies.

No problem I thought, there's a Bunnings Warehouse next door, which I routinely visit for supplies, coffee and a piss.

I head into the bathroom to find that both stalls are locked, and there's a few people waiting outside of the stalls with crossed arms. So I pretend to just wash my hands and walk outside, there's no way I could handle the pressure of someone waiting for me to go.

My paranoia won't let me walk out of a store without buying something, so I buy a bunch of 'Double A' batteries and head back to the car after the bag-checker stamps my receipt. I throw the batteries onto my passenger seat next to the McDonalds cookies.

By now another hour has passed and I'm desperate. All of the parks have locked toilets, and I'm just about out of options. So I pull over to a nature reserve thinking I'd have to go in a bush or something, when I spot a sign on a church across the road that says ""All are welcome"" - With wide open doors, no less. I really don't want to, it feels terribly wrong, *but I need to*.

I limp across the road and carefully scope the place out, there's nobody around and I spot the universal ""bathroom"" symbol on a sign - I run over, swing open the door, and I swear there were orchestral voices emanating from the white porcelain throne that lay in front of me. I do my business and wash up.

On the way out I'm overcome by a tremendous sense of guilt. There was a 'free bible' shelf on the way out, so of course I took one and added it to my stash of mcdonalds cookies and AA batteries.

No word from the client, it's 7PM and I head home.

I think I've learnt a valuable lesson today. I need to make sure I have the proper arrangements in place before saying 'no' to anyone.

**tl;dr** ADSL2 problem solved for a client. Two subsequent call-outs for moral support on an unrelated issue, attended because I'm weak. Customer was nasty to techs already dealing with the fault. Refused a third call-out citing work commitments and lateness as an excuse. Work commitments disappeared and I'm early. Couldn't go home because the client lives near me. I needed to shit. McD's and Bunnings were out of service, but I bought some cookies and a pack of batteries out of embarassment. Wound up 'going' at a church and collecting a free bible out of guilt.",talesfromtechsupport,879,1509206144
dinodin007,Laptop Repair and a mini heart attack,"Today is a quick tale that just happened, featuring me, my laptop and a mini heart attack.


I got a laptop from my sister earlier this year and never needed to use the cam or microphone until recently, upon trying to video call someone I found out it doesn't work. Doing what any self respecting tech does I finally decided to fix it. 


Proceeding as normal I disassemble the laptop and find the culprit soon enough, the microphone cable has cleanly been sheared through at the hinge of the laptop. While it was apart I decided I would clean out the fan so it runs cooler, which means removing the lcd cable from the motherboard. 


Upon soldering the microphone cable back together, I reassemble the laptop enough to test to make sure it is all 
working before putting it back together properly.


Laptop powers on, screen is dark and keyboard doesn't work, Cue my mini heart attack. So I use my phone torch to see if there is anything on the display, and there is, so powered off the laptop and reattached the keyboard hoping that I just hadn't plugged it in properly.


Test 2. Laptop powers on, screen still dark, keyboard now works, still having a mini heart attack I manage to log into windows to test the microphone which is also now working. Mission kinda accomplished.... 


New mission, isolate the screen problem of either a fried inverter or a pebkac issue. Disassembles laptop yet again, this time to the motherboard. Following the trouble shooting I learned back at school, is it plugged in, I unplugged and replugged the LCD and reconnected the power button. It's the moment of truth.....


IT LIVES. After fully reassembling the laptop the first thing he does it his story here to make sure the laptop is working properly


TLDR: Microphone doesn't work, Tech opens laptop to fix and doesn't plug everything back in properly causing him to have a mini heart attack

happytrailz1938,It’s an emergency! Come quick!!!,"This happened yesterday. 

I’m the desk, understaffed as usual and a frantic compliance/governance manager comes up to me and says “I’m in the executive conference room for budgeting and the damn thing won’t work please come help immediately!” I calmly explain what this user already knows. We are a help desk that is primarily on the phones and helps with walk ups, we have a hardware team for this and the conference room she is talking about is managed by facilities not IT. She then says “but the meeting is for the top brass and it is technology and it’s broken. This is an IT emergency”. Being the good tech I am, I call each responsible team and seeing as no one picked up and there was the chance for face time with upper management I head over with a lower level technician to check it out. 

As I get down there I find that instead of just going to the help desk, this individual user decided to go to every part of the IT department they passed on the way to from help desk.  We all arrived at around the same time. Instead of it being a room full of executives it was just the one user. 

The emergency was the best part. The “whole thing being broken” and being “an emergency” was that this user was trying to use a USB cable instead of an HDMI cable to connect to a projector. One of the managers that showed up plugged in the cable. The Who’s who of the IT department just stood there silently and then we all walked away. As we go to the elevator the top brass of the company excited going to their meeting. They will never know what happened 2 minutes earlier in the conference room they were all sitting in.

yensid7220,How i came to discover we've made no money from a customer in 19 years.,"Long time lurker here. Just got off the phone for my last call of the day. My company does website and emails. Mr. Anger Issues calls in complaining about not being able to send emails and it's an on-going issue for ""years"", and naturally he's losing thousands and thousands of dollars a day. For those of you familiar with it, Mr. Anger Issues got 

&gt; 571 5.7.1 Message contains spam or virus or sender is blocked

Long story short, we figured out that it wasn't the first two items, and now the caller is livid that the recipient has blocked him. Trying to explain to him that we don't control someone else's block list proved futile. All in all, the call took 2 and a half hours. That's not the best part.

I casually complained to a senior about the tough call that I just had and she recognized the email address. so she pulled up the support history and there's literally a good 20 pages. His average call time is about 2 hours. We resell email services and the profit is marginal. On top of all the refunds this guy has, at an estimate we've lost about 2,000 dollars on CS on this one customer over the last 2 decades... for a 40/yr email.

PAxlFitz,I called my ISP for my gmail password,"FTP, I hope you enjoy my tale as much as I have suffered from it. My work consists on providing remote support for particular users and small businesses. We have quite a wide arrange of peculiar cases, but this guy in particular ($Cust) is a quite remarkable one. He is 40ish years old, lives with his mother, but the most confusing of his traits is that he sounds really smart by the way he speaks, but he really is not. 

And he lies.

A lot.

A week ago he called because his PC wasn't fast (I know), I checked the specs and sure, Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 GB of ram, 32 bits Vista. I told him that I would see what I could do, but its normal for older machines not to run fast. 

$Cust: But my PC is new

$Me: The CPU was made in 2006.

$Cust: [silence]

Today I see an open ticket from him, so I call him and the interaction went as follows:

$Me: Hello, I'm /u/paxlfitz from $Company, I had an appointment scheduled with you at this time today. How can I help you?

$Cust: Yes, tell me.

$Me: so, you called us yesterday, regarding an issue, is this correct?

$Cust: Yes it is.

$Me: so, how can I help you?

$Cust: I don't know, I don't remember what issue we are talking about.

$Me: well, according to your file here, it was an issue regarding Outlook sync between your PC and your iPad, is this correct?

$Cust: oh yes, exactly. So, I have a PDA model $model *[no longer an iPad, but it gets better]* which I carry around so it reminds me the things I have to do throughout the day. I create events in my calendar, and then an alarm goes off to remind me of them. I used to create them in outlook on my PC and sync them to my PDA, but they are no longer getting sync'd.

$Me: Okay, what OS does the PDA have?

$Cust: Windows Mobile.

$Me: mhm okay, are you able to download TeamViewer on it?

$Cust: I can try. How would I do that?

$Me: first of all, go to teamvewer.com. Then click the Downloads button, and choose the Windows Mobile version.

$Cust: Okay. It gives me two choices, i can either purchase it or **get it from Google Play**

$Me: *[half of my brain rots]* I think you have an Android tablet, not a Windows one.

$Cust: It might be, whatever.

$Me: sadly, we do not support Android devices, since we cannot remotely connect to them. However, as long as you are able to log in to the same email account in your PC's Outlook and the Outlook App in your tablet, you should be good to go.

$Cust: well, it doesn't work, and it worked back when I had Windows XP. Why don't you connect to my tablet remotely? I can plug it with an USB cable to my PC.

*[long and tedious explanation on why that would not work]*

$Cust: What are my choices, then?

$Me: let me connect to your PC and check out your settings.

$Cust: okay.

*[Regular TeamViewer connection process]*

$Me: Okay so, what email account are you using?

$Cust: none.

$Me: what do you mean none?

$Cust: I just use it as it is.

$Me: *[seizure]* then how do you expect them to sync?

$Cust: well, through the USB cable! That's how it was before!

$Me: hold on for a sec, I'll consult with my colleague.

**Introducing $coworker**

$Me: hey bro, am I going nuts or there's no way this is possible?

$Coworker: afaik it is not possible. He's full of shit as always.

$Me: aight thanks.

Back to the phone call:

$Me: okay sir, so I have just consulted with my colleague, and we both agree: that is not how it works. However, if you want to make it work, you can log into the same email account on both devices, and the calendar should be sync'd between them.

$Cust: okay, I will do that and call you back.

*fast forward 20' $Cust calls in*

$Me: *[corporative greeting]*

$Cust: okay, so I just called $ISProvider.

$Me: *[silence]* What for?

$Cust: for my password!

$Me: What password, sorry?

$Cust: for my email!

$Me: what's your email again please, sir?

$Cust: ******* **@gmail.com**

$Me: but that's a Google account, not an @ISProvider account, those have nothing to do with each other.

$Cust: then what is the password I need to enter here?

$Me: the one you enter to access your email inbox.

$Cust: Ah! *MY* password! OK hold on.

*I ddin't remember that gmail and the outlook client don't get along*

*It didnt work*

*I offer him to create an Outlook account just for this purpose*

*We proceed*

$Me: okay, now enter the email address and password we just created here *[Outlook login]*.

$Cust: I don't remember the *[3 min old]* password.

$Me: it's the one we just made.

$Cust: let me try.

*Eventually he gets it*

$Cust: okay what now?

$Me: now you use the same login on your tablet.

$Cust: okay..................... Is it an IMAP, POP3 or Exchange account?

$Me: *[google searches for the @outlook settings, since we will need them, and finds out that he (obviously) shouldnt need to do any of that to log in an Outlook account into the Outlook app]* Please, download the Outlook app from Google Play and do it there.

$Cust: aight, thanks.

*Call ends*


I haven't heard from him since. Note that this interaction took almost 2 hours.

TL;DR: Customer is full of shit. Calls to sync his ~~iPad~~ ~~PDA~~ ~~Windows Mobile~~ Android tablet's Outlook calendar with his PC's. He said it worked in Win XP but now it doesnt in W7. He expects to sync them with an USB cable, without being logged into any email account in neither device. Calls his ISP for his Gmail password, forgets the password he created 5 minutes before for his Outlook account, is not even using Outlook in his tablet, even though he said he was.

Oh, and expected me to remotely connect to his Tablet by connecting it to the PC via USB and connect me to the PC via TeamViewer.

Mbx_Hntr,User got me good today; finally cracked a smile.,"TLDR: Dealing with tickets for a few weeks on a botched new system, I take some time to separate myself from it. As a result, a user tricks me into remembering I need to get back to it. Falling for it made me smile. 

STORY: My company is the proud owner of a brand new VoIP system. It was setup and fully configured by our third-party vendor and our systems engineers. Admittedly, I need to take more time to learn this system, but as with the heavy workload of a small department goes, everything I know about the administration of it has been on the fly learning (it's a Cisco system. Collective sigh at my understood frustration).

User1 has requested near 30 tickets in the past two months about slight changes to the phone system (as simple as changing the name on the display, and setting up the speed dial buttons. The ""self service"" portal was ""too much""). It came to the point one week were my manager told me to ""don't respond to them for three days. Let them get there nonsense worked out, and then you'll know what they exactly want.""

Finally, User1 broke it. Okay, Probably my fault, with all of the changes to their department with turnover, and desk moving, the system got pretty messed up pretty quick. 

To my amazement, if you dialed User1's extension, it instantly dropped you to User99's voicemail box. If you dialed User99's extension, it gave you User99's mailbox as he has no physical phone. I double checked all of the settings, refreshed the AD connections, double checked settings, deleted the gremlins, imported the magic dust, you name it, I've tried it all; it just is what it is at this point. 

I ignore the issue out of frustration and stress for a week; user is chill, doesn't seem to mind not getting calls.

Today, completely forgetting that I need to deal with this, I send User1 and email asking about loaner equipment. The email she sent back just said ""Call me when you get a moment"". I dialed her extension. I get User99's voicemail. I hang up the phone. I whisper ""mother f'er"". I sit back in my chair, and finally smiled about it. It was so stupid. I emailed back ""Oh come on, you know I can't. But I'm working on it.""

It got fixed that day. 


EDIT: someone asked what the fix was for closure; I won't even lie, I finally gave in and rebuilt the departments phone tree with all the finalized settings. Not the sexiest of fixes, or even how I wanted to fix it. The solution was the longest and hardest option, but most effective. 

What mattered, though, was after all the stress with this user, and all the tickets, the small ""haha"" jab of ""call me"" lightened up the whole situation. She is that passive aggressive, and she knew what she was doing. We have a good working relationship, despite our departments struggles to work together. 

EDIT 2: User1 just called me. They hired someone new to replace her at this desk. All my work was officially for nothing; I quit. ",talesfromtechsupport,1571,1508905258
Mystrsyko,I think I've officially joined the club,"Hello TFTS, I am Bowling Alley Guy, and I've always felt like a bit of an outsider here. The vast majority of you wield a keyboard and headset to work your magic on an unseen world of data while I use literal tools on much more primitive technology (I get to hit it with a hammer). But finally, finally I feel I fit in. As so many stories go, this happened on Monday.

* * *

As one might expect for the bowling industry, I work weekends, so Monday is usually my day off. And like most days I spent it watching internet videos and making memes while I waited on my laundry to finish. Of course, no self respecting tech supporter can have a day of rest without something going wrong.

About 3pm, I received a call from my manager. Our wonderful $NSFW lane machine wouldn't work when our mechanic brought it out to oil for the big men's league later in the evening. Being a relatively smart machine (at least compared to the $Peak machine from past tales) it knew something was wrong and threw an error on the touch screen. Unfortunately, this kind of machine won't operate with an error code up. I was being asked to go in to work to fix the issue.

Luckily (for them, not me) I live a short 5 minute walk away, so I had no choice but to do so. When I arrived I was briefed by the mechanic that it had a ""squeegee up"" error as soon as he tried to oil the first lane. I walked over to examine the machine and found it on the lane with the squeegee in the down position. It had also timed out and shut off to save battery power. There didn't appear to be anything obviously wrong with it, but I wanted to see it in operation to be sure the linkages weren't binding or anything.

With the machine now pulled off the lane, I powered it up and watched as the squeegee and duster roll retracted as expected, punched in what lanes I wanted to oil, and went through the process of oiling the first lane. It worked flawlessly. The realization of what had just happened was not lost on me.

I had just been called in by a user to turn it off and on again. I'm officially part of the club.",talesfromtechsupport,2922,1508856593

Hi there, it’s my first time posting to r/TalesFromTechSupport as a coworker just introduced me to it so apologies if I don’t get the layout completely right for what you guys are used to.

**Background on me:** I’m a fairly new apprentice to my company, I’m currently being sent on a wide range of different Microsoft Exams etc so I’m always quite busy. The company is a Managed Service Provider and we are basically on beckon *[beck and call]* call to any of our customers who need our help at any time *(mon-fri, 9-5 that is, I’m not paid enough to give up my weekends).*

Anyway, last week I received this call from a customer, honestly it did make me laugh. We do all of their network, we provide them a lease line etc so this kind of call is normal.

By *”this kind of call”* I mean networking issues, not what actually happened..

**Customer:** Hi there I’m having internet issues, it worked perfectly on Friday but today *[this happened on Monday]* I’m getting dreadfully awful internet. I know you boys deal with it, are you working on anything?

**Me:** No I’m not, but I’ll take a look for you, have you got your VNC number for you and we’ll do some quick checks?

*taking away the boring checks so you don’t die of boredom*

**Customer:** Actually Alex - I know what it is! This is a problem with my PC, it’s 15 minutes behind the real time in the world, meaning my internet doesn’t know where it’s going or what it’s doing because it thinks I’m from the past!

It’s safe to say after she said that I just lost it on the phone, it was too funny to brush over. I had a good laugh with her, started speaking about Back to the Future for a little bit, and by the time she’d stopped laughing I’d sorted the problem. Did brighten up my Monday morning last week!

**Solution:**The company has two sites, around 100 miles away from each other and they host their exchange server in one site, using a Site-To-Site VPN to access it.

[**Me**] Uh, hello sir, my name is [redacted] and i actually dont have an employee number...""

[**User**] ""BULLS@#T! How dare you lie to me! Who do you think you are anyway?!""

[**Me**] uh...sir, if I had one I'd give it to you, but I don't. Now is there something I can help you with? And keep in mind I will terminate the call if you continue using that language with me."" 

[**User**] Fine you lying C@!%. My phone isn't working, fix it.""

After warning him for a second time about language, and 10 minutes of trying to get out of him WHAT isn't working on his phone, come to find out the device isn't getting an IP address from his DHCP server. 

[**Me**] ""Sir, can you confirm that your phone is hooked up correctly? Is it getting power through POE or a power adapter?

[**User**] Are you calling me stupid? Of course its hooked up correctly you stupid (unintelligible). Let me speak to a manager, I'm done talking with you!

[**Me**] My manager actually isn't in the office right now, as its 3am here, but I can contact the Manager on Duty and they can call you back.

[**User**] Fine. F@ck YOU! (slams down receiver)

I message the Manager on Duty, and after a very long, and unpleasant call, (2 hours of checking the proper ports were triggered per our Network Requirements) The manager finally requested a picture of his set up, and you guessed it, the dude had the Ethernet cable plugged into the wrong port and once he swapped it over, the phone immediately came online. 

I know we may ask seemingly stupid questions, but as we all know, but simple answer is almost always the right one.

ITWolf,"I’m sorry, but it’s not that kind of error...","I’m not really tech support, but I work as an application developer for a large company ($bigcompany) whose primary business is not IT.  Being a large company, there’s a lot of small business-specific applications that the internal IT creates and supports.

&amp;nbsp;

This is a story of one of those applications.

&amp;nbsp;

A couple years into my career with $bigcompany, I’ve developed a small reporting web application ($SRApp).  Because of the structure of my group, I was also the IT contact when something went wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

There is a nightly job that pulls data out of a couple of the larger applications, manipulates it a bit and stores it in a database that $SRApp uses for reporting (displaying summary data in the browser and allowing users to download an excel report).  It was usually fairly quick and stable.  The customers (internal business people) like it and consider it ‘critical’, even though they could theoretically get the data from the source systems themselves.

&amp;nbsp;

One morning, I get in and the database is down and the application isn’t working.  $SRApp is down and will throw an error when a user logs in.

&amp;nbsp;

I contact the DBA to see if I can get an estimated time.  Unfortunately, the database needed lots of work, so he wasn’t able to give me a good time estimate other than “Hopefully sometime today”.

&amp;nbsp;

I send an email to the main $SRApp users to let them know the application is down due to some database issues and I’d follow up when the issues are resolved.

&amp;nbsp;

I figure I’ve done all I can, so I forget about it … until I get an urgent, but courteous call from $Cust.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Me:** Hi, this is $Me.
&gt;
&gt;**$Cust:**  Hi $Me.  $SRApp is giving me an error.
&gt;
&gt;**$Me:** Yup, there’s a database issue, and…
&gt;
&gt;**$Cust:** When is it going to be fixed?  I need my data.
&gt;
&gt;**$Me:** I’m sorry, there’s a database issue and the DBA wasn’t able to provide an estimate of when it’s going to be fixed.  We’re hoping sometime today.
&gt;
&gt;**$Cust:** Well, could you remove the error so I can get to my data?
&gt;
&gt;**$Me:** … 
&gt;
&gt;**$Cust:** You could put it back afterwards and continue working on fixing it.
&gt;
&gt;**$Me:** I’m sorry, but it’s not that kind of error.",talesfromtechsupport,1990,1508701019
xxthegirlwhowaitedxx,“Installing” a scanner,"A few years back I worked for a woman who was not very tech savvy. She quickly became a best friend (she was the store manager and I was the assistant manager) so when I gave my two weeks notice, she refused it and told me she was keeping me on payroll, just not as the assistant manager anymore. She changed my job title to temporary manager and would call me when managers were going on vacation and they needed a key holder that knew the job to fill in or to help train new managers. Since she would work around my other job and my kids when she needed me I was fine with this. 

Now this is in a clothing store in a mall, if we need tech support, we call a number and they take over the computer remotely. I’m definitely not a tech support worker. But one day my boss calls me because she needs a scanner installed in the back room because inventory is coming up. She has been complaining about wanting it set up back there for a while, but I haven’t been able to make it in lately as I was working a lot of hours at the other job. I’m unsure what exactly needs installed and her being her, she could not tell me what was wrong. 

So I drive to work, walk in the back room and look at this scanner she needs me to “install.” It is a handheld scanner like those used to scan large items people can’t put on a belt. When I realized what she wanted, I died laughing, got out my phone and took a video of myself “installing” it, and told her I was posting it on Facebook.

The fix? The scanner was a handheld scanner with a long cord. A USB cord. What I drove to work and got paid to do? Plug it in to the USB port. To this day it is one of my favorite stories to tell when people think she’s exaggerating when she says she’s horrible with technology. ",talesfromtechsupport,1282,1508596852
chrisman01,I have a user trying to get me fired for doing my job.,"Blood pressure is so spiked right now from being so pissed I can feel my heart. Neat.

[This is technically a continuation from these stories. Same supervisor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4zxoxe/i_cant_sleep_this_weekend_because_of_this_incident)

Came in this morning to a ticket that many users were unable to use a web based application that they use to log tickets for their departments.

I waited for user availability, asked nicely, then would go through the standard troubleshooting routines.

Turns out the application had corrupted something in Firefox. I cleared out the appdata folders and they were good to go. Developers swear it's not the application, even though it's only that application affected, and all the users had the same issues at the same time.

I thought, cool, they're back up, users are happy, I'll just monitor them and ask them to let me know if it happens again.

One person wasn't happy, of course. The b**** supervisor from hell.

My manager had me call him five minutes ago and he said she had emailed him and all of the higher ups (**all** of them. He sent me a copy. All of the management people that you never want to see on the same email) saying I had been extremely unprofessional, that I had been expected to be there at 8:30AM, and that it was our fault that things were out of date and broken.  


1) I was extremely professional and accommodating. This is all logged in the chat program and emails.

2) I arrived at 8AM. I never heard from or saw the supervisor. In fact all users but one started at 9:30, so if she had grabbed me at 8:30, nothing would be different.

3) I had discovered none of the issue was due to out of date software. In fact when I discovered the solution I had emailed her and CC'd everyone involved what it was.

She also said that I had left the office at 4PM... When I have my timesheet and everything logged that I stayed until 4:30, even though I had worked through my break. No emails, no calls, *nothing* saying they were looking for me.

This b**** also has ""slowness"" issues every single day with her laptop. I've been watching her system performance all week. I have the reports showing not only is it fine, but it's in the top systems. I hope she tries to use that against me too, then I can forward the reports and nuke this from orbit.

CYA folks. Log. Everything.

This is why even if they're in the same office I default to chat and email.

This is probably going to turn into an ongoing situation. Stay tuned.",talesfromtechsupport,3798,1508519173
MagneTismen,I just sent you an e-mail asking you how I can use e-mail,"This happened 2 years ago but I finally got out of hiatus and thought I'd begin posting more stories here as I now do proper tech support.

So in this case I'm working with our partner that tells every customer that ""they do support"" while simultaneously forwarding everything to us. In this case one of their senior tech guys installed our software on a new server in the customer's environment and is trying to license the server. The way our licensing tool works is basically

1. Register server
2. Send registration key to us
3. We generate and send a license key back
4. They activate the server

So this **senior IT manager** makes it to step 4 where, after I have explained how he can verify the licensing he proceeds with the following question:

""You said that when the license is correctly applied the server should show up green in the list. The server now shows up as green in the list. Does this mean that the license is correctly applied?""

Now, if it would have been our customer I wouldn't mind, but this is a guy who works with supporting our software and calls himself a senior IT manager.

He also ended up calling in when I was out of office demanding a remote session where we verify if it was correctly applied. Always great fun with partners.

Called the user, had them open Acrobat, accept the license agreement, then confirmed they could access #internal_application.

A second ticket from this morning:

&gt;“Client has given us new instructions on how to connect, and we cannot connect to their VPN.”

Included in the ticket was the client email about the new connection with this line: “the new vpn site is: vpn.cthulhulovesyou.com/vendor.”

Also included is a screen shot of the error the users (yes more than one) were receiving. It was a basic cannot connect message. I look at the path they had typed in. “vpn.cthulhulovesyou.com/vender”


Emailed the affected users, asking them to try the correct vpn address. Have yet to hear back.

Lastly, a ticket came in for a user complaining about being unable to login to an application. After some email back and forth, I reset their password, and call them to give them their temp password and make sure the system prompts them to change it.

&gt;Me: Ok, your temporary password is Welcome1$. That’s Welcome with a capital W, followed by the number 1 and the dollar symbol. 

&gt;User: Capital W? It’s not letting me in. 

Have user try again just to be safe, still doesn’t work. So, I remote in to verify that it’s the right site and whatnot. In the password box, I see 3 dots. Only 3. 

&gt;Me: Did you type in all of Welcome or just the W?

&gt;User: Just the W. Is that wrong?

&gt;Me: Yes. It should be the entire word, welcome. Just make sure the W is capitalized. 

She was able to get and even managed to change her password on the first try.

Not sure how “Welcome with a capital W” turns into “W”, though.

mcjagon,The User Who Cried Wolf (aka Fire Hazard),"There's a user where I work that, without fail, will call me immediately when she has a problem. If I'm not at my desk, she'll send me an email and CC her supervisor (resulting in me forwarding said email to my supervisor). I've gotten so sick of her ignoring my attempts to get her to use our ticket system, that I often leave my office as soon as I see her calling. More often than not, her issue is solved by me waiting it out. On this particular Friday morning, I was having none of her crap. Her call came in and I walked out.  

A few details before I continue - I work in a school, so the user in question is a teacher. She teaches digital photography as well as some hands on art classes that require cabinets and shelves all over the room to hold the supplies. As such, her room is not conducive to a lab type setup so we gave her a laptop cart. Anyway, when I returned to my office, her usual email was waiting for me. This time was slightly different, though. She included my supervisor by default... hmm, must be important. **Subject:** computer cord on cart sparking. **Body:** Hi #5 laptop cord on the cart starting sparking just now please come check asap, unsafe.  

Crap. I rush to her room to see her nonchalantly on the phone while her students are working quietly. She points to the cart and continues talking on the phone. What I saw was the dumbest thing she has ever done. She took the frayed cable and placed it on top of the (metal) cart. The cart was still plugged in, mind you, as was the charging cable. It doesn't end there folks... to keep the cable from falling down, she placed a **BOX OF TISSUES** directly on top of the frayed part of the cable. My brow furrowed and my jaw dropped as far as it would go. I looked at her (still on the phone) and back at the cart a few times as my brain tried to process what I was seeing.  

Knowing I wouldn't get any help from her (since she was on the phone and basically ignoring my presence), I tried to think of how best to proceed. The cart itself was in a position that made it impossible to unplug from the wall. The only way to cut the power would be to get maintenance to flip the breaker. I didn't feel like waiting, though. For all I knew, the cable could still be sparking underneath the tissue box. What I came up with, was to hold the cable at a safe point and smack the tissue box to the floor, allowing the frayed portion to fall and no longer touch the cart. At this point I was able to reach into the cart with my free hand and disconnect the power cord. I waited for the stored charge to die and then walked back to my office to show the other two guys. After a bit of venting/ranting I went back to replace the charger. She was still on the phone...  

And that's how I saved a bunch of kids. /s",talesfromtechsupport,1592,1508345853
uv_searching,"""We have the best F*ing codes in the country!"" &amp; somehow breaking their own water valve while I'm on the phone is my fault.","So, this finally inspired me to actually write a story. Just happened two hours ago, as well. Answering customer service tech-support for a stupidly expensive kitchen appliance company. (Yes, they do have 24 hours, hence the call being at midnight-ish).


Customer was having trouble installing his new water filter for his fridge. Heard it before, of course. Turns out customer had been messing with it for an hour, and had basically stripped any of the plastic threading and jammed it all around. I legitimacy just opened the manual, and read to him verbatim what the manual's instructions were. (I get paid to help people with these fridges, they don't pay me enough to OWN one: Side note, so many rich callers not getting that when I try to explain why I don't have personal experience with their fridge.) Starts getting mad at me because that's not what the box for the filter says. I agree with him that it's odd, but suggest he try it the way the manual says for a moment. This after being put on speaker phone, despite me (calmly) explaining that I can't hear him since he is putting his phone 5 feet away on the table, and his head is inside a god-damned fridge. I can hear him struggling for a while, before more cursing, and him stomping over to pick up the phone:


&gt;Angry Owner: ""Now it's leaking all over!""


&gt;me: ""Ok, well what we need to do right now is to shut off the water supply to your fridge itself to stop that.""


&gt;AO: ""And where the hell is that?"" (Most people don't know the basic layout of their home. Pro tip: Know where to shut off both your water &amp; your electricity, if nothing else.)


&gt;me: ""In most parts of the US &amp; Canada, the code is to have the shut off be under your kitchen sink: Yes, it does not matter how far away your sink is from your fridge, mine is over 5 feet away and on the opposite wall.""


&gt;AO: (After ""looking"" for all of half a minute) ""I don't see it, it's not there. I looked.""



Normally they stop bothering to look at this point, and I get off the horn, telling them to call a plumber, but I was somehow able to get him to actually get on his knees and stick his head in, when he saw exactly what I said would be there, a quarter inch pipe with a valve on it pointed in the direction of his fridge. 


He then proceeds to somehow snap the entire valve off, and start having water leak all over under his kitchen sink now. I don't know how he did it, he sure didn't sound like Clark Kent, but he's getting more and more pissed, demanding I tell him what to do (note: Although I do my own plumbing I am NOT a plumber, and I was making that clear). I tell him that I don't know the code in his area, but most require a shut off to parts of the home, and to look for that, otherwise to shut off the water to his whole home and call a plumber as the water would just keep streaming out (since he insisted the water line for the fridge appeared out of the back wall of his under-cabinet, and not from the water line that was actually feeding the sink). At that point:


&gt;AO: ""Don't you fucking talk about codes. We have the best fucking codes in the country. You hear me? We have the best codes! The best!""


Ahhh, swearing: When I get to hang up.


&gt;me: ""Yes sir. In that case, you'll need to call a plumber.""


&gt;AO: ""Basically I'm worse off after talking to you, then! What's the point of you? You told me different directions than are on the package!""


&gt;me: ""Yes sir, I don't know why they are printed differently.""

&gt;me: ""To talk about how you broke your pipe? Yes sir, they will know. Good night.""

P13romancer,Just an average call between Help desks.,"
I was working a wonderful weekend. Had my cup of coffee, playing some wonderful tunes. Browsing r/news.  The day was looking bright and just so nice. But nope, no fun allowed at NOC.


**A little backstory**
I recently was promoted in my company and I was put in charge of all the escalated issues and *critical* locations (databases, factories,  plants, etc etc).  Usually, this is a breeze as the people who set these locations up were far more competent that your average Joe.  

Well, for some unknown reason that afternoon a very large. Very important *Plant* went offline. All of it. Access points, switches, routers, Netgates, and firewalls. If it was in my system it was red.
Now, any other day this would have been a all hands on deck ""the roof is on fire lord help us"" situation, however I know this company regularly does maintenance on the weekend.  

I decided to give a call out to their local engineering team as the alarms hadn't cleared in almost ~two hours.


**Me** = Well yeah me.  **NCE** = nonchalant engineer


&gt;**NCE** ""*chemical company* operations center what can I do for you""  

&gt;**Me** ""Hi there **NCE**  I was calling about your location that has been offline in our system for quite some time now""  

&gt;**NCE** ""Oh, *that one*, you don't have to worry about that location for some time.  

&gt;**Me** ""Im sorry what do you mean?, is it being decommissioned?""  

&gt;**NCE** ""Nope, as of early this after noon it was reduced a few stories. Once hazmat and fire crews finish their job we'll see if we can salvage the location""  

&gt;**Me** ~~just completely speechless~~ ""Could you give a little clarity here?! What do you mean *a few stories*""

&gt;**NCE** ""Yeah, it blew up man. They evacuated a few neighborhoods""

&gt;**Me** *im still trying to grasp this* ""I mean, do they have an ETA? What about the equipment? Was anyone hurt?""  

&gt;**NCE** ""nah, everyone's accounted for, it was supposed to be some maintenance. We'll email your MAC team tomorrow about this one""  

&gt;**Me** ""......Alright sure man?  



In the end, their equipment malfunctioned during maintenance and caused some gas exchange that is definitely not supposed to happen. Ended up totaling most of the plant and sending equipment that's not supposed to move a good ways away.  


They're a good company to work over, but just wayyy to slack about major issues.  Even though our equipment was spread out across a few 100ft they just sent in a ""*ah man*, sorry this happens, we'll send a check for your equipment"" email

MuffinPants996,Customer traps himself in his house.,"Hello! Buckle your popcorn and grab your seats cause his one is a long one.

I used to work for a home security company in which I did account creation surveys and basic technical support. 

One day, I receive a call from a customer saying he can’t disarm his system. He was very upset as he had important places to be and he claimed he didn’t even want the system, but that it was his mothers idea. Most customers who couldn’t disarm their system were old and just didn’t understand or remember the 2 stepsrequired to disarm the system. Funnily enough, from the sound of his voice, this guy wasn’t old.

As is standard procedure, I asked him what his verbal password. He can’t remember. I ask him what his 4 digit panel password, as we’re allowed to verify customers that way as well. he can’t remember that either. He goes and asks his mother, she can’t remember either. 

Now we have a problem. System requires the 4 digit password to be disarmed. This perplexed me as the customers account indicates that they’ve been customers for several years. Have they never armed their system? Anyways, if  he tries to leave, his system will go off and the monitoring station will call over the panel on the wall. as no one in the home knows either password, we will have to send the police to make sure everything is okay and there are no burglars or the like in the home.

In essence, this man is trapped in his home.

I informed him that I could not help him unless we had those passwords. I told him we could attempt to reset his password by sending an email. He agreed. However, upon further inspection, I noticed a small spelling error in the email account we had on file, which cause the email to not send. Company policy prevented me from sending an email to any other email address than the one we had on file. I also couldn’t tell the customer the email address on file. 

The only option left was to mail him his password, which could take almost a week if not more.

Upon learning that there was really nothing more I could do for him, the customer went off on a mostly unintelligible rant about how he needs to leave and how I should just make an exception. The next 15-20 minutes were a back and forth of 

Him: “Make an exception!” 
And 
Me: “No I can’t.”

The call had stretched to about 45 minutes at this point. I racked my brain trying to figured out what to do. Then I remembered that some customers buy keyfobs (think remote car keys but for your house) for their systems where they can disarm without having to put in their code. I ask him if he has one and he said he does. I walk him through the disarm process and we disarm the system.

TLDR: customer traps himself in his house and can’t remember codes, we find his keyfob and he is free.

LilJayMillz,The guest wifi isn't working. We have 100 users who need the Guest wifi!,"Hi all, been awhile since I posted. This literally _just_ happened so figured I'd share.

Usually am a Monday-Friday type of guy since I work for a school board. We have a tech camp for Teachers every year and they want tech support so I volunteer (OT HELLO)

We also have Teachers from other boards attend, and they must use the Guest network. No problem we create a username and password for them to use. This event usually runs flawlessly and I sit back and connect a few devices but other than that just relax.

Until today

I set up around 8 AM. At 8:05 the organizer of the event comes to me freaking out

&gt;Jay , our keynote speaker can't get on the Guest Wifi. NO ONE CAN GET ON THE GUEST WIFI! He needs access!

No problem, let me try *puts on sunglasses like a badass because tech support*

Shit. Not working. Alright clearly something is wrong. Break all cardinal rules, use my credentials to log into Wifi for his machine since he has to present in _checks watch_ 5 minutes.

&gt;But Jay! Everyone else!

Email my network team. No response. Other person running the conference calls our CIO (Great) and she texts our network guy.

In the meantime, create a generic account on our School Wifi (3 different networks in the school). Advise users to come see me, set them up on that account and write down their names so we can clear it afterward.

Network guy calls

&gt;Hey, just use the guest network for your school.

&gt;Jay : We are at this location

&gt;Well there is your problem, we set it up at the wrong school!

Cool. Get that fixed, people are helping themselves. Lineup disappears from my table and we continue on.

&gt;Presenter: USE THIS HASHTAG AND WIN SOME SWAG!!

Oh no...Twitter is blocked!

EMAIL EMAIL EMAIL

&gt;And go on youtube to follow our live stream!

OH COME ON! 

EMAIL EMAIL EMAIL

&gt;And join our facebook group

Meh, thats blocked normally can't do anything about that.

Everything seems good. Presentations went off without a hitch

Time to put on a movie and relax a bit 


TL;DR : Network team decided it would be good to set up the Guest account at the wrong location and then disappear for a bit",talesfromtechsupport,2530,1507997524

Bossman: Hello /u/Sneak_Stealth.


Me: Hello Bossman.

Bossman: How are you?


Me: I'm alright, but i'm intrigued to know why you're calling.


Bossman: Well, I have a question, do we have power supply problems with Dell Optiplex 790s?

Me: Yeah we do, why do you ask? Did an important optiplex die?

*Sidenote, we have a lot of these small form factor 790s lose their power supplies*


Bossman: A very important Optiplex is dead, and when i replaced the power supply it was still dead.


*Now here, it's important to note that I work in support for a K12 school district, We have 8 sites that myself, and the rest of the IT department deals with.
Tonight is Friday night, it's about 8:30pm as I type this.*


Me: Well on the back of your power supply there's a black button, press it.
Bossman: I press and hold it, it comes alive but then dies when i let go.


Me: Well then it's probably not your power supply, but either your power button isn't working right, or your motherboard is more than likely dead. 


Bossman: Well shit, we need this up before tomorrow at 6 am for a damn swim team meet. What do I need to do to get this running again?


Me: Well you could probably go put your hard drive into a different 790 and hope that works


Bossman: Where would I find another 790?


Me: In $otherSchoolBuilding, behind $L1Technician's desk


Bossman: Okay thank you, bye.


Me: Bye Bossman

TheLightningCount1,"Reclassification. A tale of woe, hardship, and victory. Otherwise known as a Friday. Or how I learned to stop worrying and call HR.","As part of a new rollout for tightening up security controls, we went about reclassifying everyone into new groups appropriate to their station. This killed a LOT of access that people no longer had a business reason to have. 

Before its asked, no there is no epic story involved in the making of this decision. An executive asked an employee something and the employee did the thing they asked for executive. This raised the question of ""How was he able to do that?"" Apparently he had that access from being on a team that no longer exists. You can guess how this went from there. 

So back to the present, we rolled out the reclassification on Tuesday. On wednesday very few people noticed so we only had 1-2 calls. On Thursday however, oh man did we get the floodgates coming in. 

I was proactive when I learned of the reclassification and made a form for people. For tickets in the system we responded with a form I made in conjunction with HR. 

&gt; Name -

&gt; Job Title - 

&gt; Role - 

&gt; Immediate supervisor - 

&gt; Requested function - 

&gt; Business reason - 

HR gave us all standard responses based directly off of their job title and role. 

&gt; As a ___ whos job function is ____ you are responsible for blah blah blah...  Based off of this, I will have to deny your request for *Specific function* If you wish to escalate have your manager submit a requests here *address for escalations.*

Well so far so good, we get about a jillion calls which turn into tickets in the system. About 2 jillion tickets into the system, and about 100 remote support sessions a day regarding this. All of it is handled the same way. 

Are you a manager? No? Then no. You are a manager? Business reason? CIO says no. 

For every 100 users who were told no, we had 1-2 that legitimately had a reason to have it. Somehow access got turned off thanks to wrong classification. Those were easily fixed and handled perfectly. 

Today though. Today was the final call from a guy who was asking for it since Wednesday. 

He had his request denied on wednesday and his manager refused to escalate for him. 

Then he started to get creative. 

Actors in this scene are $me = The bobs and $TU = Term User. Or Tom Symcowski.

&gt; $me - Thank you for calling *our company IT* how may I help you?

&gt; $TU - Yes my printer has disappeared from my devices. Can you help me get it back?

I walk through the steps to readd it and test it. 

&gt; $TU - While I have you on the phone. (Oh boy here it goes.) I recently lost access to *specific function* and only have access to *general function* in *certain program.* 

&gt; $me - What is your job title and Role?

&gt; $TU - Well I connect the customer with the *agent* and make sure that all of their needs are handled while we write the loan. 

&gt; $ME - What do you mean you handle their needs?

&gt; $TU - Well while the client is being handled, I collect their information so that the *Agent* can rapidly write the loan. 

&gt; $Me - Oh ok. (That is the *Agent's* job.) Wait that is the *Agent's* job. 

&gt; $Tu - Normally yes, but this way they do not have to spend as much time with the customer and can rapidly write the loan. 

&gt; $ME - (That makes very little sense) OK well I am just IT. Your printer is installed and I have made a ticket for you regarding your access request. 

&gt; $TU - Oh I already made one and it was denied. 

&gt; $ME - Ah well then I will go ahead and close this ticket then. We can not bypass the approved process here. If you want access your manager will have to grant it. 

$TU hung up pissed off. 

Two hours later he pulls the same crap with another one of the guys I manage. I collect the information and start typing up an email to HR regarding this guy. 

As I am typing, I hear another one of my techs saying the same thing to him. I ask him to add me onto the session. The user had removed his printer in the devices and printers console. He was removing his printer and calling IT in the hopes that one of us would bypass the established system. But my guys had already seen what happens when you bypass the established system months and months ago when the wahoo lady messed up big time. Those that don't know about it know that myself, and my manager will write you up with zero warnings for bypassing established systems as a shortcut. 

None of our guys and gals do it. 

At the end of the day on Thursday I get one more call from him to my direct line. Not the team line. 

&gt; $ME - This is $me.

&gt; $TU - I need *specific function* right now. I have to enter the personal information in for *agent* on this loan or we will lose the loan. 

&gt; $ME - (No you wont we are a mortgage company. Not a realtor.) I can take a look into this issue, but I can not grant any extra access for you. 

&gt; $TU - You don't understand, if I do not get this done we will lose the loan. The *Agent* is also here freaking out. 

&gt; $ME - Well if the *Agent* is there, why cant they enter the information?

&gt; $Tu - Because that is MY JOB!!!

I quickly terminated the call and pulled the log. I attached it to an email and sent it off to HR as well. I was done dealing with this pimodonna. 

This morning. 

I check the email and see that they are looking into the issue. Two minutes later we got a ticket in the system to terminal all access for the employee. 

Later I get a call from him. 

&gt; $me - Hello $TU

&gt; $TU - Hi I was able to get the issue taken care of. At my home I am able to use *program* outside of citrix and have the access I need. I just thought I would let you know. 

&gt; $Me - Sure thing. By the way, have you been in to talk with your boss this morning?

&gt; $TU - No. I had things to do today. 

&gt; $ME - (Oh I am an ass) Your boss has an important update regarding your access. Although you will need to go in so they can properly assist you with the change. 

&gt; $TU - Oh really? Perfect I will leave right now then.

I got off the phone with him and opened up AD to see how they still had access to *our program.* Turns out that killing their access to citrix is all that is done for terming a user as everything is accessed in citrix and almost nothing is accessed outside. 

This user happened to have an old computer with *program* on it though so their account was still active. 

I got with my manager and we set up a new policy for terminating ALL access when a user is set to Term status. ",talesfromtechsupport,620,1507911294
ditch_lily,Remember when I said I don't do industrial machines?,"I've got a new job! The shop slowed way down over the summer, a lot more than summer usual, and is being slow to pick back up, so I cut back to part time hours and picked up another part-time job. Doing what, you may ask, that's relevant to TFTS? 

...Sewing, of course. I was hired partly as a stitcher, and partly for my tech skills. I spent part of the first week of training with the actual techs, learning machine basics (so much for my avoidance of industrial machines!) and am something like Tier .5; I'm the one all the other stitchers come to when they have a problem, and it's my responsibility to sort out minor issues and pass everything else up to Ed, the actual tech. The boss has made it *very* clear that the other stitchers are responsible for their own basics though-thread and bobbin changes, new needles, jam clearing, and other minor issues.

This project is still in its infancy. Well, more like still in its embryonic stage. Theoretically, we're supposed to launch November 1st, but I'll eat the next garment off the flat seamer if we actually do. (Somewhere out there is a team building a website for our custom-ordering portal, and to them I give my deepest condolences. We're at opposite ends of the same, ever-changing project.)

So, in the meantime, practice. We've got a ton of precuts from the previous contractor who was trialing the project before bidding. (In the end, they didn't.) None of them are to pattern spec, and the pattern has changed on a near-daily basis since then anyway, but for practice with the machines, they're fine.

There are only a half dozen of us, and one of those is cross-training from the main business as backup. I already know who my problem child is going to be-meet Sandra. She's a nice enough lady; a long-time sewer, although not pro, and a school 'counselor' during her regular job. She is also the *most* scatterbrained person I've ever met in my life.

Because this project is so new and still in flux, we all have notebooks. Eventually they'll give us a process to follow, partly based on our input, but until then we've been creating our own. The notebooks all go in the same basket, and the last person out for the day puts theirs on top, because they'll have the newest changes. We all know to check each other's notebooks for those changes, which, as I said earlier, are happening daily, some days near hourly. My notebook has pages (and pages and *pages*) of notes about the machines, too, which everybody else knows to check for needle size info, which way to thread what (may the gods have mercy on your soul if you thread the flat seamer left to right instead of right to left, because I certainly won't) and various other bits of necessary useful info.

We *all* know this, except Sandra. Who called me *five times* yesterday, in the first hour she was in, in between texting me a flurry of badly lit, out of focus pictures of whichever machine she's forgotten everything about *this* time.

In that hour she asked about how to change the bobbins in two different machines (one of which doesn't even have a color change), how to turn the vacuum on the serger on, how to thread the elastic through the binding foot, how turn the rotating foot on the grosgrain machine, how to turn down the speed on both the serger and the binder, and how to use the pneumatic snap setter without having to push both buttons at the same time. I got short with her over that one, when she demanded I come down (we're actually in the same building-gotta love networking!) and show her how to bypass the safety buttons. (You put the snap pieces in the die, center the fabric, then push down on both buttons at the same time, neatly keeping your hands out of the way of the pneumatic press.)

I *will* be talking to the boss about this when I go in today. A. this was all stuff we learned the first week, and B. the answers to most of her questions are in the notebooks not 30' from her, and C. damn, helpless much?? 

By way of contrast, on Wednesday Carlina said, ""Hey, I broke a needle in #2 (a flat seamer) yesterday, replaced it, checked the rest and rethreaded. It sews fine, but just so you know."" Which is how it's supposed to be.

Fortunately for my blood pressure, she only works a couple days a week. 

eta: I didn't have to go looking for the boss, she came looking for me. I didn't realize that Lili was working last night too, and she left a note for Bosslady because she thought Sandra was calling Ed...y'know, the guy who charges money for this sort of thing. Plus Lili was annoyed that Sandra was spending all her time texting and not sewing, without realizing she was texting me. I showed Bosslady my phone log and the text string (which I'd kept), and when she got to the part about bypassing the safety buttons, she clouded up like an August thunderstorm. Those of us in today got called into an impromptu safety briefing (complete with a demo about what happens to things caught in the snap setter), and informed that bypassing *any* safety procedure once will be grounds for a write-up; twice will be cause for dismissal. Since I don't know whether she managed to bypass the buttons or not, I suspect she's only going to get a lecture about it. That, and managing her own basic tasks on her own. And I'm getting paid for the hour I spent on the phone, which is nice, too. Thus endeth my week.",talesfromtechsupport,1278,1507897458

tendonut,Morning Announcements,"This happened maybe 15 years ago, my first IT gig. I was a building-based tech for a middle school. Our technology teacher, who was not very tech savvy, was very ambitious, which can be trouble when you don't know the subject matter well.

The Technology teacher (TT) took on the responsibility of switching the morning announcements from audio to a CCTV broadcast. The school had recently been outfitted with that functionality, which worked just fine. We had the port in her room set up as an input. 

The ambitious part, was she wanted it to have a higher production value than just a camera pointing at a bunch of middle schoolers. She wanted graphics and text and a green screen image, all that. So she spent a few seconds googling and sunk like $400 on this video EDITING software. She also picked up a USB video capture device. I was never consulted on any of this.

Two issues. 1.) This is post-production video software, not on-the-fly overlay software. 2.) She's trying to do this on a 4 year old 500MHz Celeron w/ 64MB RAM. 

She called me down one day to set up this software and told me what she intended to do. I cut her off though, explaining that this software was for post-production and could be used for the announcements if she was ok pre-recording things the day before and having the kids edit the video afterwards, before it aired. That wasn't good enough. So after some frantic ""OMG WHAT AM I GONNA DO"" type exchange, she sent me off. 

A few days later, she calls me down at once again just as I got in. I was confused by what I saw. The lights were off, there was a projector throwing an image of the school on a white wall, and there were two kids sitting at a table in front of that white wall, squinting as the light was shining in their face. TT is trying to use a cheap long throw projector to throw a background image behind the morning announcement speakers. The conversation went like this:

TT: ""tendonut! Good, you're here. The light is in the kids eyes""

Me: ""Well yeah...you have a projector in front of them""

TT: ""Well, how can I stop that?""

Me: ""Don't put the kids in front of a projector. Maybe mount it on the ceiling?""

TT: ""We tried that, but it was still in their face""

Me: ""Uhh..well...there isn't much you can do about this""

TT: ""Well, can you get the light to just not shine in their face?""

Me: ""Um...well it's ugly, but you can put a tiny strip if paper in front of the lens to block the light from their face directly, but then you'll have a shadow behind them

TT: ""I don't want a shadow. Isn't there a way to get the light to wrap around them?""

Me: ""Not unless you have like a black hole or something""

TT: ""Can we get that?""

Me: ""uh...haha...do we need to bring (Science teacher) in here to explain this?""

TT: ""What if I asked (my boss), do you think he'd be able to do it?""

Me: ""No. Just...no""

Eventually, she gave up. But she made sure she kinda dragged my name through the mud for not being able to help her do what she envisioned. Physical impossibilities be damned. ",talesfromtechsupport,1536,1507817014

Another 30 minutes of bitching and finally she calms down and says she'll email the info of where she will be staying.

I contact the daughter, find out that shell be at the company by 2pm, and ill be able to get it shipped. 
2pm hits, daughter shows up with ipad, and i get the ipad shipped. It cost over $300. EA emails CEO the tracking info and includes the shipping cost.

I get a call from Boss asking to see me. I jump to and go his office. He proceeds to complain to me about why i shouldnt have included the cost of shipping in the email to CEO. 

DM: but Boss, its IT policy that whenever we ship something, we send tracking number and shipping cost. You had me write it up, and you signed off on it.  Hell, it was approved by Controller, CFO, and CEO.

Boss: yeah, but that doesnt apply to the CEO. 

He and i get into a 20 minute discussion about IT policy and who it applies to. (Everyone except cfo and ceo)

Two days later i get to work and get called into Boss' office.

Boss: well, the ipad is delayed in Customs in germany. Was randomly selected to be inspected. And Customs lost the shipping info. You need to call CEO and tell her.

DM: WHAT!?!? 

Boss: its your project. See it through. 

I grumble, groan, and make the call.

This time, it was just her sounding like a fire siren and me saying ""im sorry"".

Finally, after 2 more days in Customs, it shows up at the hotel in germany. The Hotel proceeds to deny receiving it because CEO is no longer a guest of the hotel. 

CEO completes her business in Europe without her Ipad, and manages to beat the IPad back home.

I got into IT (sysadmin) through a different way. Without talking your ears off, to put it short: Took part of a government-program for adults to learn a profession, in my case IT. 1.5 years of theory and half a year of practice with written tests and a project and of course an oral-exam with a powerpoint-presentation.

After passing all my written exams and project, I had only the last part of it ahead of me in two weeks. The government had given out our profiles (if we agreed) to interested employers and one of them called me. Later on I found out because of my project that included scripting in Linux. At the time they called, I wasn't near my phone and only heard the voice-message to call them back. I checked their website and found the section where they offer work, but only 2 positions were mentioned:

1) Programmer in Java; that's a no-no, I cannot code besides C, C++ and some C#/VB (only C was taught to us during the theory-time, the rest I self-taught myself because I got a little hooked on it)

2) Student assistant; now that was below my skills.

I actually intended to rest for a few weeks after passing the last exam and before applying for jobs, because those 2 years were hell. Not because of subject, that came easy to me, but other personal stuff that happened and I had like 0 time off. Every time we got some time off, I got sick and had to use the time off to get better.

But oh well, I thought why not give them a call, I'll use it as practice.

-----------------------

&gt;$Secretary - The woman on the other end

&gt;$Me - Intrigued by their call

--------------

&gt;$Secretary: Hello this is &lt;company&gt;, my name is $Secretary, how can I help you?

&gt;$Me: Hello this is $Me, you tried to call me but I missed it. After hearing your voice-mail, so I called back.

&gt;$Secretary: That's nice of you to call back....

*Some talk about my past, experience and so on*

&gt;$Me: So which position did your boss have in mind when she saw my profile? None of them seem to fit me.

&gt;$Secretary: Actually I got no clue. She just told me to contact you and make an appointment with you.

*Awkward silence*

*I just couldn't believe what I just heard*

&gt;$Secretary: So do you have time next week?

&gt;$Me: Sure. Friday maybe?

*I just wanted the Friday off from my practice-program (boss was an a$$). I could have put it off until after the last exam, but this way I had a whole day off for a 30 minute interview.*

&gt;$Secretary: Sure. 10 am sounds okay?

&gt;$Me: Yes, will be there.

*Thanks, bye, the usual formal stuff at the end of an conversation*

------------------------

I arrive early on the day, I hate to be late. I used that time in-between to check out their website a little more, get a profile of them as good as possible, check some ratings from former employees on social platforms. Inside I'm met by $Secretary and she leads me to the conference room.

They had a nice sign at the front door for everyone to see ""Today we welcome $Me to our company"", which put me in a good mood. Small things count and such a nice effort might not cost much, but I had never seen before and I've been to a few job-interviews before.

I'm told that $boss isn't there yet, but she wont be in the conference room anyway. The interview will be held by the same people in the linked topic up on top. $Boss comes in shortly, shakes hands, says she has another meeting in a different conference room and that she will come in later.

*$IG and $TIC enter the room, shake hands and sit down*

------------

&gt;$IG: Welcome $Me, thanks for coming.

&gt;$Me: Thanks for the invitation. May I ask something first before we start?

&gt;$IG: Uhm, sure.

&gt;$Me: On the phone I couldn't get an answer from $Secretary what position you have in mind for me. My programming-skills are nowhere near as good as you would want them to be and the other one is way below my skills. It is hard for me to have a job-interview not knowing what position we talk about here.

*They look at each other awkwardly*

&gt;$TIC: Well, we might have an open position for you as sysadmin. But it also depends on your other skills, so we can use you in different areas as well.

&gt;$Me: Like what? Programming? I would need to have classes for that, I can program you easy things like battleships, snake and other games from the 90's but that's like a child's play compared to what is being asked for here.

&gt;$TIC: You would of course get the classes/workshops you need. But it hasn't been agreed yet what part that might be if we decide to hire you.

&gt;$Me: I understand. So shall I start to talk about me and my experiences?

*I'm usually extremely timid and shy. But because I didn't know what was waiting for me, I felt like having the biggest self-esteem in the world. Something like that would have never come out of my mouth if I had known what I was up for in there*

&gt;$IG: Sure, go ahead.

I tell them about my project, configuring UPS with raspberry pis, setting up automated shutdown- and ether-wake commands in case of power outage and of course in case the power comes back. The order of the commands is configured with sleep-commands in-between to give certain servers like Exchange, DC and ESX enough time to boot up before others can communicate with them.

&gt;*Sidenote: Configuring the raspi with Fedora on it (Fedora wasn't my choice, boss told me to use it) was hell for a newbie like me at that time. Smb.conf, krb5.conf and winbind.conf were hard to figure out. After the successful join of the domain, it went easy.*

I continue, telling them about my strong parts (databases, network, servers) and my weak parts (html). They seem to like what they hear and ask me some questions and it goes on for like 45 minutes. More awkward silence moments occur because we are basically done but are waiting for $boss to show up. After 15 more minutes of basically asking me stuff that I possibly couldn't know at that time with my background, $boss finally appears again and the other two leave the room.

----------------

Instead of sitting in front of me like the other two did, she sits right next to me.

&gt;$Boss: So what do you think?

&gt;$Me: So far I like it.

*After an hour long interview my brain went autopilot. I was pretty drained at the point*

&gt;$Boss: Well, I have to tell you $Me, you are a really charismatic person. People just feel drawn to you by having you in their proximity.

*What the...?!?!?!*

&gt;$Me: Really?

*I wasn't capable of forming normal sentences anymore. I was just happy I didn't stutter or something like that*

&gt;$Boss: Yeah, have you never been told before?

*Shaking my head*

&gt;$Boss: Your smile just puts one at ease. It feels like all negativity is negated by your presence.

*Brain: Null Pointer Exception*

&gt;$Boss: I think as a person you already fit in here quite fine. I would like to have you come for two days of trial after your last exam. How about mid July? That way we can see whether you like it here too and how you can deal with the tasks at hand here.

We agree and I leave. I had parked about two hundred meters away from there. During my walk back to my car, I think about what just happened in there. Never, seriously never had I heard of a job interview going like that. I cannot remember all the positive things she said to me about me. Just to be sure, I called all my family and some good friends, telling them the story and asking them what they think. All came to the same conclusion: They need someone urgently, they seem desperate to blow smoke up someone's a$$ like that.

-------------------

First I intended to continue with the two trial days, but I think this is long enough and I will continue with it another time.

TacticalBastard,Ma'am for the 50th time we cannot give you your sons password.,"LTL FTP, etc.This happened last year, but a recent post elsewhere sparked the memory

Little Background: I work IT at my college, usually I work in back so I don't have to deal with people, but once a week I get to grace the helpdesk. My school gives it's students a lot of privacy and they can decide what the school can release to other people when they come for orientation, it ranges from we're an open book to we can't verify the students existance. This student selected, we cannot verfy his existance which applies to everyone that is not an immediate family member.


So be me, bored out of my skull watching the minutes tick by of the last 5 minutes of my shift, ready to get dinner. I get a call from whom shall be known as $apache (very agressive helicopter parent, hence attack helicopter).


**$me**: Thank you for calling $myschool ITS help desk how can I help you


**$apache**: Hello! My name is $Apache and my son goes to the school, but is having trouble logging in to $ouronlinepanelforstudents can you give me his password?


**$me**: I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble however we do not keep students passwords on record, however if he is having issues with it he can reset it online, call us, or come down to $buildingwe'rein to come get it fixed!


**$apache**: OK can I get it reset then? He really needs to get in


**$Me**: I'm sorry but it has to be him who asks to get it reset, I can't do it for anyone else


**$apache**: But I'm his mother, I can get it reset for him


**$me**: I'm sorry but it _has to be him_ who comes and gets it reset, it can't be anyone else, even his immediate family


**$apache**: But I'm his mother, I've done everything for him


**$me**: I understand that, but college policy states that only the student can request a password reset


**$apache**: I'M HIS GODAMN MOTHER YOU INCOMPETANT PEICE OF SHIT, GIVE ME HIS GODAMN PASSWORD


At this point I know it's about to get fun, I look back at my manager, who is totally awesome and loves stuff like this, and signal her to get on the line and listen.


**$me**: I understand your frustration, however I can't go against college policy, I would reccomend that you call your son and tell him to call us to get is password reset. 


**$apache**: NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME YOU LITTLE SHIT, IF YOU DON'T RESET 
$hersonandpersonIknow's PASSWORD RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING TO GET YOU FIRED


Her son was one of the guys who lived on my floor and I knew, but wasn't really friends with.


**$me**: Ok, let me talk to my manager and see what I can do.

I go back to my manager who is already smiling about this lady, and I tell her I know this guy and if it's alright to text him and let him know that his mom is on the phone asking to chage his password. Since its about his account she says go for it.


**$me** -&gt; **$myfriend**: Yo buddy your mom is on the phone cursing me out cause I won't change your password, did you need it reset?


**$myfriend**: What no. I know my password, why is she calling you?


**$me**: She's saying you forgot your password and is now going off the walls, I put her on hold and I'm sure she's steaming at this point


**$myfriend**: Wait, what's her name?


**$me**: $apache


**$myfriend**: lol that's not even my mom it's my stepmom. 


If you remember from the very beginning this student had selected the ""I dont exist to the outside world"" privacy package, so now we could have even more fun with the attack helicopter parent

_back on the phone_


**$me**: Hello $apache?


**$apache**: Yes! What took you so long!!


**$me**: Sorry I was just looking over some information and I don't see you on our files anywhere being related to any of our students.


**$apache**: So what! I just want my sons pasword!


**$me**: I'm sorry, but we have parents of our students on record and youre not on any of them


**$apache**: $student is my step-son! That's a son!


**$me**: I'm sorry, we can't release any information at all to anyone that's not an immeditate family member. 


**$apache**: He goes to the school and I'm his mother! Give me his password!


**$me**: I'm sorry I cannot verify $student's enrollment at our school.


**$apache**: WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN YOU LITTLE SHIT, I'M GOING TO HAVE YOU FIRED.


At this point my manager is giving me the ""cut the call"" sign so I just tell her:


**$me**: I'm sorry I couldnt be more help, thank you for calling $school. Have a nice rest of your day


**$apache**: DON'T HANG UP ON ME YOU LITTLE SH-   *click*

We work for a rather large health insurance company here in the US, we tend to have a fairly large contingent of work at home employees. When setup they are sent everything and instructions with pictures and color coded wires, etc, they are supposed to take a 4hr class on working at home that includes how to setup the equipment and they sup/manager is their first contact before us 

This lovely employee calls in having issues setting up her hardware VPN router and computer. After the usual formalities it is determined that the caller has not even attempted to do any setup, policy is to have them pull out the instructions and follow them, goes something like this: 

Tech: Ok get teh instructions you were sent and follow them
Caller:  I can't read .... 
Tech: What do you mean you can't read? How do you do your job? 
Caller:  Oh I can't read things I don't want to deal with
Tech:  OK, please call your Supervisor or Manager to get assistance, we can only assist if you have issue after the setup, and let them know you can't read

realpelican636,"""Is the iPad App we requested going on the laptops or the desktops?""","LTL FTP all that fine stuff (please treat me kindly!)


I work as Desktop Support at a fairly small $College which has some weekend classes for kids. After getting assigned to the off-campus area where these classes are located, I've been working with $PC (program coordinator) to make sure all the necessary software is in place before said classes start. She's fairly nice, but definitely a little behind on the computer skills, which is fine, that’s why I have a job. We're looking at a laptop cart, a room of computers, and an iPad cart. 


After a email discussion with my predecessor, $PC puts in a software approval request for a new iPad app. This request was very clear, even had the app store link and explained why they needed it on the iPads. Said request was soon cleared by the higher powers and so went into the next semester prep list.


Enter the 9 PM e-mail:


&gt;$PC: Is $APP going on the desktops or laptops?


&gt;$ME: $APP is only available for iPads, and will go on the iPads as requested in the software approval form.


Next morning, first thing, phone rings:


&gt;$PC: I got your email, and it's problematic


&gt;$ME: how so?


&gt;$PC: $CLASS is scheduled to use iPads at the same time, and we only have 20 iPads! Can we borrow more, maybe from $DEPT? $DEPT said we could probably borrow theirs!


(Now I'm starting to panic as well because $DEPT, another department at $College, is 10 miles away, has no guaranteed availability on its iPads, and has a long history of being insubordinate to IT)


&gt;$ME: That sounds like it would be a bit of a logistical nightmare. Youth software is trending towards more mobile apps, it might be a good investment to buy additional iPads.


&gt;$PC: Could we put it on the computers using Android? Are windows and android the same?


&gt;$ME: *patiently tries to explain that iOS, Android, and Windows are completely different, this software is only an iPad app, and due to its photographic nature, would be difficult to find an alternate for on a standard PC while still only half awake*


&gt;$PC: I see. How much would an additional cart of iPads cost?


&gt;$ME: *glad things are winding down* I’ll have to discuss this with my supervisors, we’ll get back to you.


*standard end of call exchange* 


Friends, this is how bad foresight turns into $7000 worth of iPads.


TL;DR: Department requests iPad app, gets iPad app, already scheduled iPads for use, tries to backtrack",talesfromtechsupport,1810,1507356563
P13romancer,I'm not sure I can return this to Cisco sir.,"Hello TFTS! My tale last night honestly went over better than expected. Since I currently am off and have had myself a nice tasty beverage. I figured I should share this one as well. MODS, if this isn't technically TFTS  worthy let me know and/or go ahead and take her down.


Back in my early days of IT, I had to work in the warehouse as our company was partially short staffed. I handled most the RMAs that came through and I sorted what faulty equipment our customers actually sent back so it could either be refurbished and reused or sent to Cisco to be recycled. Customer in question goes through about 15 phones a month.


Well, one of my current customers deals mostly in pets and pets supplies. They don't usually handle the network for their store and we use a contracted tech that we love to death. On the other hand sadly, when it comes to their phones and other small equipment like that, its up to them to install. I really...really wish it wasn't.

We get an order for a Desktop Office phone thats needs to be sent as the current one has a cracked screen and a couple of teeth marks as its stationed in the training facility of the store for the animals. I processed the RMA for the office phone.  We ship this out no problem, its there next day for this courtesy of the boys in brown and the customer is happy.


However, *however*, what we get back is not what we at all expected.


First off, if wasn't at all as heavy as it should have been. I wasn't as smart as needed to be. No. I opened it up expecting them to send back the wrong device maybe? Nope. **Its was a juvenile bearded dragon**. Little guy was adorable and scared, but looked nothing like a phone.

I immediately called the stores district manager trying to figure out what happened. Turns out, they put the lizard in our RMA box, and sent the customer on their end who **actually ordered the lizard** our RMA'd phone.


After showing the little guy to the folks up top who thought it was hilarious, we sent him to the local store near us and finally got things settled with the store. Happily its been a few years since they have done something like to us.



TL:DR
Phones aren't supposed to have scales.

madcatscientist,"I'm sorry, your call has been mis-routed. Try again when you're awake.","A few years ago I was doing tech support for a company that had several different clients. The clients name would always pop up on your phone so you knew which call banner to use.


There were a few clients that we did after hours and on-call support for. One client in particular we ONLY did on-call support for. As their tech's phones would automatically roll over to us after 5:00pm. Most often we would get calls from this client around 5:01 pm asking for help. They would realize that they got the after hours support, get flustered and immediately hang up.


Since we had to take these after hours calls, we had a fun on-call rotation between me and 3 other people. The only gracious thing is most of these customers we only do remote assistance. Only a few are in town and be helped with on-site coverage.


I'm not one of those people who function at 3 am very well, and so on-call shifts for me were the worse. I usually blundered through problems it in a half-dazed sleep attempting to just find a way to punt this off until the morning when some one with a more functional brain can make an adequate attempt to solve the issue.


Here's one time, where my half-bedazzeled brain almost got me fired. - Luckily I got away with a written warning. Here's how I said it went down. 


I received a call in the middle of the night from a our L1 Tech saying this customer (The one we auto-support after 5:00pm) well, their phones are down in a building. They were calling on a cellphone to try and have us get on-site support. This particular customer is a remote help customer, so all I have to do find the on-site personal and give him a ring. Easy... Right?


No. Not right. The documentation for this customer was bad. In my week of training it made some sense, enough that I figured I could bobble my way through. But in my half-diced-and-scrambled-brain-that-was-still-trying-to-figure-out-how-to-dim-my-monitors-down it made none. After rummaging through documentation for an HOUR. I hunkered down and decided to just try and call anyone. Even if I call the wrong person at this point, I've sat on this ticket for too long and need to get some one else on it. I would go to work in the morning and go over documentation and training again for the next call. So, I find a guy, that looks like a legit on-call on-site person. I ring him up. He says he'll get some one on it. I hang up. Update the ticket. WHEW. SLEEEEEPPP.


Next morning. My boss is waiting my by desk. Uhh oh. 
&gt;Boss: Did you get an call last night?


&gt;Me: Yeah, phones were out in some office. I called the on-site guy.


&gt;Boss: Do you have proof that you called this person?


&gt;Me: Yeah, I have a phone log on my phone. Why?


&gt;Boss: Because that ""office"" (yes, my boss air-quoted it.) was a hospital, and they are pissed because they didn't have phones for 8 hours and their on-site personal knew nothing of it.


&gt;Me: Oh crap. Wait, but no I called them. I'll send you a screen shot of my call history.


&gt;Boss: You better! And you need to send it to me and my boss.


&gt;Me: Ok  


Boss leaves and I just quietly mumble ""oh crap, oh crap, oh crap."" Like a hundred times to myself  as I sit down at my desk and diligently take a screen shot of my call history and e-mail it to my boss and his boss.


After about an hour of me failing to remain cool and attempting to take calls my boss finally comes to my desk with a spare chair. - Which means we are going to have a long talk. But it's in the open, so can't be too bad right? Right?


Turns out I did call the right person. YAY!! I however called him at his office number and not his cell-phone number. And remember what happens to their office numbers after 5:00 pm. They automatically get rolled over to us. The ""on-site guy"" I talked to was really our L1 tech. Who, I thought was their on-site tech because he answered the phone with their banner. 


The L1 Tech thought I was the customer calling in again telling them that their phones were still down. So when he told me ""Okay, I'll send some one out there."" He thought he was reassuring the customer that we were handling the issue. Since he knew it was already reported.  


The L1 Tech never asked me for his name, and I never asked him for his. The L1 tech got a verbal warning for not upping the priority. My boss got a kick out of it when he found out this is what happened. His boss however, still wrote me up. 

TLDR; My brain forgot to call a cell phone number instead of an office number at 3 am and I accidentally called my own company to help support my ticket.

Working at a semi-small 3rd party tech firm. Basically cover all networking aspects. ISP vendors, meetings, equipment, dispatches, so on and so forth.


One day, a sensor alarm in a router we manage for a company (This customer handles the wiring and location of the equipment themselves. We just supply it, and let them know when it stops working) in Texas goes off. Well, Bossman has told us if the alarm isn't critical, don't call them.  Well, it finally went critical. This call went to the archive my director keeps.


**Me**

**Teenage Intern** TI for short.


&gt;**Me** Hello!, this is P13romancer, we noticed your router is getting quite hot over there. Being Texas, we 
  know it can get pretty toasty. Is there anywhere we can help you move it?
&gt;
&gt;**TI** Oh sure sure man, I actually know the perfect place. Its where I go to cool down during by lunch break


Now, thinking nothing of this, we see the alarm disappear. All is fine right? ~~If only it was that easy~~.


About 48 hours later, a new alarm shows up. *water damage*. We give good ole **TI** a call again.

&gt;**Me** Hello! **TI**, we noticed the heat alarm went away, but now another alarm has come up. Where exactly did you put this router?
&gt;
&gt;**TI** Hey P13romancer, well I put it underneath our closets A/C unit. It should be pretty cold right there right? We keep it set to a nice 68.


My desk could have cracked with how hard my head hit it when I heard him say that.

We explain for a solid 30 minutes that is not the best place in the world. After some back and forth he finally says his manager will take care of it in the morning.


Sure enough, the alarm is gone the next day when I come in. However, the heat alarm is now back, annnnddd its worse, ~~like its no longer working worse~~. 

I also have a call that has been on hold waiting for me.


&gt;**Panicked TI** I made sure the router would not get wet, but now there is this weirdblackgoocomingoutohgodwhathappened 
&gt;
&gt;**Me** Whoa there TI, explained what happened and we can go from there ok?
&gt;
&gt;**TI** OK, well, I figured I could take care of it before my manager showed. I went ahead *and wrapped the 
    router in a plastic wrap* we have, so it would not get wet over night. 


I was honestly stunned at this point. I was speechless. After composing my self and sending a nicely worded email to our RMA team, TI got a new router that he was never allowed to touch.


When we finally got ours back, and that black goo? It was the black plastic. The router had gotten so hot over night that it melted the the wrap and it poured into our equipment.

TL:DR, New guy at a company wraps a $2000 router in plastic to keep it from getting wet because it was under the A/C (which was there to keep it from getting hot)",talesfromtechsupport,1691,1507250346
Rathji,How I saved $Client almost $800 a year in a 30 min phone call,"I work for a MSP, and while this isn't typical TFTS math, I think it fits. 

Background:

In 2008, $OldITGuy at $Client, registered 2 random domains, $Clientdomain1.com and $Clientdomain2.com and set them up for hosting on their $ISP account, but the domains or hosting were never used in any respect beyond this initial setup. When the domains were set up, $OldITGuy@$Client.com  was set to receive all receive all notifications, but that address has not been in use for a long time, and as far as I can tell, was not around when we moved $client to Office 365, 3 years ago. Last year, as luck would have it, $Client got audited by Microsoft , and as part of that audit and the resultant digging, we identified some licenses that were tied to a Microsoft account in $OldITGuy, so we added that as an alias to the $clientadmin account, so we could facilitate a password reset to gain access to $OldITGuy VLSC account.


Present Day:


Couple days ago, we get a couple email renewal notices for the domains on the $clientadmin account, so I checked with $Bosses at $Client to see if this was domain that was supposed to be there, and no one had any idea about it, so we decided to cancel it. Of course, this involved a call into $ISP billing support. 

During my call with $ISP, we determined that not only were the domains registered since 2008, but they had grandfathered hosting plans along with the domain registration which totaled $70 per month. For reference, plans of this nature that $ISP currently offers are from $7-17 dollars per month. This billing was for 12 months, for 9 years, which makes the total amount paid for these domains and hosting almost $7000.


I just finished emailing $Bosses and $Accountant at $Client to get their $ISP account rep to find out if they had any other of these mystery charges that they should expect. 


tl;dr $ISP charges $7000 over 8 years on an absurd price plan for domains and hosting that was never used.",talesfromtechsupport,1712,1507209302
othello1,"Welcome back from vacation, the FBI is waiting for you in Conf 4.","Many years ago I was working in the data processing side of mortgage banking. One of my jobs at the time was hardware support for a 200 person call center. Clients would license our software to process their loan portfolios. Our system was very comprehensive, which also meant clients could cause problems with the greatest of ease. 


I was responsible for keeping the reps on the phones. If a machine crashed, I had to have the rep back up within 60 min. In my lab I had machines preloaded with everything they needed. When a machine went down. I only had to move over their personal data. If the HD crashed, I had a backup of their data no more than 48 hrs old. All in all it worked fairly well.  


Because I had spare machines, parts and backup servers in my lab, I had been pushing for some time to get a card reader on the door.  It was always “too expensive, maybe next year”.  Keys were  tracked, but we all know how well that works.  


One afternoon one of the rep’s machines went down. I retrieved the down machine, moved over the files and got them back up. I checked the machine and decided a reload was in order, but not until I got back from a 5 day vacation starting the next day. I cleaned up the machine and left it on a shelf.  


Vacation went great. It was during the good old days when BlackBerrys were for executives only.


First morning back, while still on my first coffee, I get paged to Conf 4. As  I walked in I found myself in  front of : my boss, his boss, head of security for our location, head of security from corporate HQ and an FBI agent. My first thought was to back out and run, but I was afraid the FBI might have other ideas.  


While I was gone, someone had gotten into my lab and stolen a pc, the last one I replaced before vacation.  When one of other IT guys noticed it gone, he tracked back to the rep it had crashed on. She confirmed that I had swapped machines, but had not thought to mention that before the crash, she had a client send her about 200 live customer records to use in troubleshooting.

 

These were the days when HIPPA was a new thing. Somebody realized that confidential client info may have been compromised by our dept. and it all hit the fan. Thus the august  group waiting for me.  The FBI did all the questioning about data, procedures and security. After a bit, they asked about my security procedures.

Kamina_Crayman,MY TEMP LAPTOP WON'T GET EMAILS!! WHY IS IT SO USELESS!!,"Hello TFTS This happened not too long ago.

So we have a bunch of external users who work from home, mostly because they travel all round the country on various jobs. One such individual has been experiencing problems with his laptop which I've been unable to diagnose over the phone or via remote so I've asked him to bring it in and we'll give him a temp laptop to use in the mean time while we fix it. I'm going to call him Kevin for the purposes of this story.

Several hours after I give Kevin his temporary laptop, my phone goes off and Kevin is panicking already 

&gt; $Kevin: Kamina_Crayman!!! My emails don't work, I've literally just got home and I can't get my emails! I've got them from this morning but i can't receive any more, It's so important that i get my emails working on my laptop. When i try to do anything I've noticed this error that says ""Microsoft outlook cannot connect to the exchange"" are the servers down?

&gt; $Me: Kevin did you connect your laptop to your home internet?

&gt; $Kevin: Where would I find that?

&gt; $Me: In the bottom right hand corner look for a little wave symbol with a red x 

&gt; $Kevin: You mean this one here?

&gt; $Me: I can't see it but it's exactly like your old laptop so if you click on it you should get the option to connect to your home internet and your emails should work.

&gt; $Kevin: Ok so it might be that, I don't think it is though, are you sure the servers aren't down I can't connect to our ERP software either.

&gt; $Me: Just try that first, i'll go and check the servers to make sure everything is working perfectly if you're still not getting emails or can't connect to the ERP after you've connected to the internet please feel free to call me and we'll get it sorted out. 

Kevin hasn't called back, somehow I don't think it's the servers

TLDR: Kevin forgets to connect temp laptop to home wi-fi, blames servers for his lack of emails instead.",talesfromtechsupport,2515,1507043397

I actually understood it, but I just didn't want to. God, please no.

Radijs,"Holy, moly? Thanks TFTS for instilling me with the cynicism nessecary to do my job!","Super short, just got a call from a user. She was working from a different desk instead of her usual one. And called me (instead of the ICT support desk) because the screens didn't work and she needed someone to come over to give her some support.

It was a windy autumn morning. The warm late-summer weather of September had cleared to make way for the true fall of Oktober. And I had just come in work, pushing my bicycle against the screaming wind and fluttering leaves to settle in behind my desk With a nice warm cup of mint tea to get ready to face the dooting of Monday...

My desk phone rang but immediately silenced to ring nevermore! And was sharply reminded that indeed, I had it forwarded to my cell phone.  
So I answered dark and dreary, and a cry for help I soon did heary... (And this way of writing is making me weary).

I answered, and indeed a user called:

&gt;L: Hi his is Lenore from $department normally I work in the offices of $Venus. But this morning I'm on $Mars and there's a computer here with two screens and they aren't working. Can someone come over to give me some support?

&gt;me: Good morning Lenore, you say they aren't working. Can you confirm for me that the PC and both sceens are on?

&gt;L: The PC is definately on. I can hear the fans. But I don't know about the screens. In $Venus they had buttons on the front. But here I can't find any buttons!

&gt;Me: Allright, well there should be a power button at least. If they aren't on the front, they're often on the bottom or side of the screen. Can you check for me there?

There is a tapping as if someone gently rapping... No we're not doing this again. There was some scuffling on the line and afterwards a happy answer.

&gt;L: Yes I found a button and it looks like the screen is turning on. Thanks!

And so behold. The wisdom instilled by TFTS made me remember to first double check if everything was on!

While I was writing this she called back that she didn't know her login credentials since her other computer was always signed in with a generic account.  
So I called the ICT service guy for the login credentials, but he's still stuck in traffic.

Brownbagwriter,I Said Somewhere Safe,"A few years ago, when phones had to have upgradable storage or you were up shit creek, and before the real advent of cloud service, we used to have to have customers backup their stuff to either a computer or an SD card prior to doing a factory reset. It was a pain in the ass since most of our customers were not the savvy types, but it was worth the time spent to keep them from having an absolute meltdown.

The process was pretty simple. Backup, remove the SD card, have them check none of their pictures and such showed up with the memory card out, then nuke the phone and start over. You just have to remember to tell the customer to put the SD card with everything it somewhere safe.

So, I walked this lady through the process, everything is good. I tell her to stash the card somewhere safe ""like in a drawer or somewhere else you'll easily remember but secure enough that it won't go missing"", because with her problem we needed to test the phone for 24 hours with nothing extra in it or on it to confirm her issue was either hardware or software related. As we're resetting her phone, mid-restore, she let's out this God awful scream and starts cussing up a storm. 

I'm thinking, -the fuck is going on? Did she forget to backup something and she's just now thinking about it?-

I ask her what's wrong, and she proceeded to tell me that her SD card, which she'd left on the arm of her chair in full view of her dog which she'd told me earlier in the call was a grabby little shit, just got ate by said mutt of a dog. Her whole backup. Fucking gone.

We then have to have that conversation that, no, we don't keep copies of your stuff anywhere here, and yes, you really are that stupid.

Plus side, her phone worked fine after the reset.

Sarcastic-Tech,"""I dropped it...""","Backstory: I am senior server support blah blah blah for local customer computer manufacturer, CCM, recently purchased by one of this planets largest purveyors of electronics, I've been in the IT &amp; Support game for 20something years. Some years ago, my company was selling customer laptops to a rural college specializing in agriculture. With the fantastic laptops, we also offered the option of a super-duper warranty, we would cover physical damage to these laptops under warranty... cracked screen, no problem! Button broke off the keyboard, OK! Spilled a cup of urine on it and fried it... I guess (*I* didn't have to work on it, I was disgusted but hey, I'm not the one touching it)

I Really I griped about this warranty, it was stupid. Eventually as the laptops were going EOL (end of life), we ended up having to ""upgrade"" the laptops to a newer, more expensive model to meet our warranty agreement. Well the students on campus apparently got wind of this and the warranty requests increased substantially - as I fully expected.

There was this one student, let's call him HillBilly Bill, ""somehow"" snapped half the keys off of his keyboard, called in, got the RMA, sent the unit in, we replaced his keyboard on the laptop. No big deal, but how does that even happen?! Whatever, fast-forward a week, student has received his laptop back and calls in asking why his laptop hadn't been upgraded like his friend, JimmyJoeBob's laptop was.

**HillBilly Bill** &gt; Yes, it works fine.

**Sarcastic-Tech** &gt; Ok, then what issue are you experiencing with the laptop?

**HillBilly Bill** &gt; My issue is that it's the same laptop I sent you and not the new model my friend JimmyJoeBob got when he sent his in.

I looked up that slightly (weeks) older repair ticket and discover his friends laptop was in fact replaced due to ""excessive force"" applied to the screen's hinges, in the wrong direction.

After a few days, we get a call from the schools IT Dept &amp; Campus Security that the student confessed to AND is being charged for insurance fraud (a felony, good job).
I believe they said he confessed to cart-wheeling the laptop across a parking lot and then stomping it, which may have been caught on campus security cameras - which is congruent to the damage seen.

I think he was even expelled for this as well as getting the felony, clearly winning.

Over 20something years, I've dealt with my share of irate people, I'm usually quite good at calming them down and fixing whatever 
their issue is. This particular woman was ALWAYS cranky and quite frankly I had had enough of it. I go to my supervisor, I explain the situation (he's well aware of her tendencies). I explain to him that I find her behavior unacceptable and that I would like to file a formal complaint with her company. We both go talk to our manager, re-explaining ensues, he said he would look in to it. 

A week later we are called back to the manager's office to discuss that call. He had apparently called to talk to her boss and was told in no uncertain terms that she has had problems like this before and she would not be allowed to call our company anymore, another employee will call for her.

I'm like hecks-yea! Suh-WEET! I'm never going to have to talk to that batch again!

3 weeks later she's calling again... I hear other people in my department talking to her, her name is often said ""in such a way"", accompanied by an eye-roll...

I also notice, thanks to caller-ID, that when I answer a call from that company, I get a lot of disconnects right after I identify myself. In fact, 4 times in one day this happened. 
I immediately think something is fishy and shoot off an email to her boss and a few of her coworkers that often call in asking if any of them had been trying to call in and inquiring if they had been experiencing any trouble with either their or our phone system.
About 15 minutes after the 4th time that day, I get an email from my manager that was a forwarded from her manager, of her accusing ME of hanging up on her.

Mystrsyko,Getting flashed in a bowling alley,"Hello TFTS, and welcome to the most NSFW story ever told by Bowling Alley Guy on a tech support subreddit. The story about how I was once flashed by a pinsetting machine.

* * *

The day began for me as most days did at this particular location, at roughly 4pm, just in time to prepare the lanes for the evening's league.  Although our $Peak lane machine occasionally gave us trouble, this time it was running smoothly and all was routine.

Immediately after oiling the lanes, we clean the lane machine and refill the oil and cleaner tanks so it's ready to go for the next shift. This can usually be done in the back, but by this point in the week we were running out of premixed cleaner. Said mix was kept and dispensed from an 8 gallon container on a cart, because we didn't have any plumbing in the back and we sure as hell weren't carrying 8 gallons around the center by hand.

So I wheeled the cart up front and into the storage room behind the snack bar. Rather than use the sink, $FM had us using a hose and valve attached to our soft drinks system. The reason being was because he wanted to use water that has passed through the system's filters, and although it was slower it meant that we almost never had to deal with mineral buildup in the lane machine's lines and spray nozzles. If only the other centers I've worked in did the same.

Anyway, while I was doing that, $GM interrupted me to let me know there was a bowler having an issue with lane 31. It's particularly annoying when the first open play of the day experiences an immediate problem, but this one intrigued me. Apparently the pin light was flashing like crazy... which shouldn't be possible but by this point in my career I'm willing to believe anything.

As I walked by on my way to the side aisle adjacent to lanes 31 and 32, I could see very clearly that the light was in fact flashing quite noticeably at roughly 3-5 hertz. This was baffling. I've seen the light ""flicker"" when something is misadjusted and is triggering the jam switches briefly, but this was a steady flashing while the machine was idling. As I walked along the side aisle to the back my eyes burned holes in lane 31 as I struggled to figure out where to even begin to search for the problem.

And then I noticed something odd.

The pin light on the machine *wasn't* actually flashing. The pins themselves remained steadily lit from the front the entire time. The flashing was occurring on everything *around and behind* the pins. There is only one source of light on each machine. What I was seeing *shouldn't be possible*.

If I have learned anything from the History Channel, it's that all unexplained light sources are the result of aliens. However, according to the Travel Channel all unexplained lights are ghosts, so I was completely bewildered and confused as I turned the machine off and applied LOTO. Both the pin light, and the mysterious flashing, cut out when the power was shut off, as one might expect.

So, with nothing to go on besides the observation that the flashing occurred behind the pins rather than in front, I dropped the rake to the guard position and crawled down underneath the machine towards the pit looking for...well something. Anything.

Aliens probably.

The pit on these machines consists of a sloped board on a pair of steel frames, roughly 5 inches below the lane, and between 1 and 2 inches separate it from the back of the lane. This is because it oscillates forwards and back rapidly (at roughly 5 hertz) to shuffle pins back towards the pin elevator.

And sticking out of this 2 inch gap, was my C mechanic's large D cell, LED flashlight (or torch as the rest of the colonies say). Somehow, it had been left in the machine and ended up resting vertically in this gap. Through a series of unlikely coincidences, not only was the flashlight body the perfect size to fit, but the lens cap was in the perfect place to hold the power button at the *same exact height* as the upper pit frame, *causing the pit to turn it on and off* in rapid fashion as it oscillated.

Also, to my complete amazement, the flashlight received nothing more than a few scratches. Considering these machines will break pretty much anything that gets in their way, that really speaks to the build quality of that flashlight. 10/10, would remove from a pinsetter in fully working condition again.

**TL:DR** - Flashlight fully lives up to its name",talesfromtechsupport,1581,1506521400

&gt;Wife: Already done that, All the lights are on

&gt;Me: Okay, This makes no sense, Work is getting no Authentication attempts. Go to the modem, turn it around and check where the cabled are going into

We're a small team of web devs and we've had the pleasure of working with this *delightful* client for a couple years now. The original agreement we had with them was for us to do a huge Wordpress site (with Geodirectory) in exchange for business from them (they are supposedly influential in the industry we target).

Rushed through for next week (never mind our already hectic schedule with other clients). They've already printed materials with all this new stuff (new domain names, etc) without telling us. We will not be doing anything without a rush fee because this is outside of original scope.

&gt; **$PM** This is out of original scope and will cost. I will speak to the team and we'll get back to you with a quote.

&gt; **$CFH** We're not paying for this, you need to it for us, we had an agreement (original agreement was fulfilled, the site was signed off)

&gt; **$CFH** Why does Wordpress take you guys so long anyway, I do things all the time so fast in Squarespace

&gt; **$PM** *sigh* Let me talk to my team so we can get you an estimate.

&gt; **$CFH** Would it help if we bought you guys pizza?

User called up saying that their $0X MFD wasn't printing in colour. and that they couldn't find the option to turn grayscale mode off.  No bother, I show the user how to open up 'Devices and Printers' right-click  on the printer, open up 'Printing Preferences', go to 'Image Options' and....



hmm...


OK, well it looks like grayscale isn't on after all.  Ah!  But $0X have management options wherein accounting codes are required to print in colour.  That's gotta be it.  OK, so open up the management window and... everyone's allowed to print in colour.  No accounting codes.



Dang.  Well, OK, let's grab the hostname and open up the web utility and see if there's any settings on the printer itself that might explain this.  Just minimize this and this and oh, an open print preview window...

Zeewulfeh,More from Aviation Maintenance: The Blue Engine,"**The Blue Engine**
*Or, how I learned Maintenance doesn’t know which hand is which.*

Late summer in Kandahar, we had a pair of T714-55-L engines roll into the shop. These would be engines from a CH-47 Chinook, and compared to the T700s we had normally worked they were monsters.  We’d gotten used to them but were still a little slow working with them as they were new to the shop and most of us had seldom or never touched one since AIT.  They also seldom had any issues—it took a lot to wear them down to low power, they saw less flight time than a Blackhawk might, and the Chinook has an inlet screen that the Blackhawk lacks entirely.  

Very little, aside from Surface-to-Air Missiles * , would do one of these big guys in and instead if they were replaced it was either due to time or something had gone wrong in the engine itself.  On that late summer’s day, our viewing of *House* and weekly poker game was interrupted for just one of those times.    It was dropped off by our Production Control officer, a very large and intimidating gentleman and a Maintenance Test Pilot.

&gt;Production Control Officer: “Hey, here’s the two engines for you guys on the Phase over in the Chinook clamshell.  Just so you know, the #2 over-temped and needs to be replaced.”

&gt;Engine Shop: “#2 Over-temped?  Okay, we’ll replace then.”

They didn’t bother bringing us the logbook, so I let them know I’d come over to sign the -1 form (the form that would have the issue written up on it in the log book) when we were done swapping the equipment over to the replacement.   We didn’t have the same shortage on the T55s that we had on the T700s, but we also planned on doing the over-temp inspection to see if we could put the engine back into service.  Unfortunately, doing so was a very long and involved teardown on this engine (it was nowhere near the Lego set that the 700 is) so we’d save it for a rainy day.  It was more efficient for our turn-around to just replace it and drive on.  

We brought the replacement into the shop, removed it from the shipping container, and gathered around to admire it.  The combustor case was a brilliant blue, the sort of blue caused by extreme heat on metal.  In fact, one of the very first things you look for on an over-temped engine is heat coloring like that, and in this case it was a brighter blue than the engine we were replacing—that one had its own rainbow on the combustor case.  The #1 had a similar rainbow of heat coloration, though slightly more intense.  

Seriously, heat coloration on metal is actually pretty cool to look at.  Go ahead, look it up.  Take your time.  I’ll hang out here while you look at the awesome pictures.

We double checked the tag, confirmed that indeed, it was a serviceable engine and proceeded with the swap.  Because of the scale, it takes about a day to a day and a half to swap all the parts over, so it was about two days of work before I found myself back in the maintenance clamshell to sign off the replacement in the logbook, at least up to the engine being ready to hang.  

I paged through the logbook for ten minutes, skimming for the correct entry, but I couldn’t find one that said anything about the #2.  I doubled back through and read more carefully before coming upon one of the final logged issues:

&gt;#Number 1 Engine Over-temp condition, XXX Degrees for XX minutes.

Oh hell.  

I grabbed the logbook and returned to the shop to show my Glorious Squad Leader, since I knew he wouldn’t take my word alone for the snafu we were now in.  

&gt;ZeeWulf: “Sergeant, take a look at this. We just replaced the wrong engine.”

&gt;Squad Leader: “What do you mean, let me see tha—Oh #@&amp;%!”

We looked at the three engines, and realized that we had a choice: We could swap everything back off the #2 replacement back onto the original #2 and then swap the #1 with the replacement or we could just swap all the equipment from the #1 to the old #2 and basically perform a double-engine change on the books.  With the amount of time we had left, we figured it would actually be faster to just do the paperwork and swap the #2 to the #1 position and leave the engine we’d already built up alone to go into the #2 position.  We notified Production Control of the plan and began the work to swap. 
 
Did you get all that? Basically, we replaced the right engine needlessly, so rather than do two days of work to get everything switched over to the left properly, if we just did some paperwork we could make the old right engine into the left engine and only do a day of actual work.  And this, everyone, is why doctors always ask you what side you’re getting cut on when dealing with limbs and mark the limbs clearly. 

A couple hours later and the Production Control Officer stormed in, livid.  

&gt;PC Officer: “You are wrong, the #2 engine over-temped!”

&gt;Squad Leader: “Sir, the log page..”

&gt;PC Officer: *Pointing at the replacement #2 engine* “Do you see that?  Do you see how blue it is?  That engine over-temped!”

&gt;ZeeWulf: “Um, sir… That’s the replacement engine.  It’s brand new.”

He left very, very unhappy, no doubt to chew one someone and make them unhappy too.  And we swapped the engines over, as planned.


* *The SAM I'm referring to is the one that killed Flipper 76, A/C 644 in May of 2007.  We didn't know it at the time, as they were telling us it was RPGs that had downed it and they had classified the fact that the Taliban had MANPADs.  The remains of the helicopter were brought to us to help piece together/sort through, and I discovered that, despite taking a near hit from a missile the engine was fairly intact, at least externally.   May the aircrew rest in peace.*",talesfromtechsupport,1100,1506430954

gargravarr2112,I have a new respect for users who swear everything is connected,"Hey TFTS, obligatory TLA string, LTL FTP TR-WTF ETC. Amongst aircraft techs and reactor engineers posting stories, I feel this one is kinda lame, but I think the angle redeems it.

**TL;DR** even tech support can have facepalm-inducing moments!

So I changed jobs in August, moving from DevOps to sysadmin/desktop support in a software startup. One of the key things I'm responsible for is building machines for new starters; as the company is a startup, it is growing like crazy. Now, we have an eclectic mix of Macs and Ubuntu-powered Dells, mostly USB-C MacBook Pros and 13"" XPSen, of which new starters get a choice. We also have a vast number of [these 34"" screens](http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-34-curved-ultrawide-monitor-u3415w/apd/210-adtr/monitors-monitor-accessories).

So, as I'm getting used to, I get a message on Slack about a new starter for the following week (I'm starting to call these 'surprise starters'), and that they want a Mac. No problem, grab a brand-new boxed MBP, wireless keyboard, mouse and a few other odds and ends. Now, previously, every one of those huge monitors had been set up on desks and people had moved around. This time, I need to unbox a brand new one - the box is the size of a small fridge! Nonetheless, I unpack the expensive screen, set up the stand, attach the power, DP and USB cables and position it on the desk for the new guy. I unbox the brand new MBP and assemble it, plug in the adapter and connect it to the screen. Then I fire up the laptop and grab the USB stick with my pre-built Mac image, and turn on the screen.

This is where things start getting weird. The LED comes on, but the panel stays dark. The LED begins to pulse, but awkwardly, not the smooth fading that the other panels do. The Mac boots into first-run mode correctly. After a few seconds, it figures out there's a DP-USB-C cable connected with a screen on the end, and flickers as it initialises. Except it doesn't. The panel stays dark, and the Mac flickers again. More interestingly, the OSD doesn't respond, and the touch-sensitive buttons (which I hate, no tactile feedback) don't do anything. All signs at this stage are pointing to a dead screen.

I look down at the box and realise there's something hanging off the desk.

The mains cable!!

Yes, I forgot to plug it in. Somehow, either the DisplayPort or the USB3.0 connection (or both together) are providing enough power to the screen controller that it tries to power up, but nowhere near enough to drive the huge panel itself. Behaviour like this does not immediately suggest 'no mains power' to me - especially the fact that the Mac detected there was a screen connected and tried to output to it.

As the title suggests, I now understand how users can swear blind they have everything connected when they've left the thing unplugged - this thing fooled even me! It goes without saying, as soon as I plugged the mains cable in, the screen fired up perfectly and everything was good.",talesfromtechsupport,1373,1506284706
DivinePrinterGod,Breaking Deadlines,"I forgot. I forgot that working for a software house meant that if you antagonise your customers then they go elsewhere. I forgot that the directors go out of their way to appease those who make the most noise - and this is the reason why we have a high help desk staff turnover. 

One of the help desk girls sidles up to my desk with a look of defeat on her face, clutching a print-out of a support call with some hand written notes added. 

&gt;HDG: Smith Medical say that they need Government Secure Integration by this date for compliance reasons. Is that something that we can deliver?

The CTO of Smith Medical is a shouty kind of guy who's reduced many a helpdesk person to tears or quitting.  He's callous enough to keep score of the number of technicians he's made quit because they obviously can't do their job.  Apparently that number is 17.  He also understands that when presented with irrefutable evidence, he has to back down.

&gt;Me: The GSI module is at least 3 months away but mandatory compliance isn't until April 2019. I show her the government website which clearly states the compliance dates and phases. 

Armed with this info, she returns to the desk. 

The next day, one of the Directors asks me to sit in on a phone call. It's the CTO of Smith Medical, who we'll call George.

&gt;George: GSI module. One of your tech staff suggested that we didn't need it, but we require this live on our system by 1st September. Our government and Medical compliance certification requires it. I want you to fire her as she's incompetent.

&gt;Boss: She's not incompetent, she's actually a good technician.  The government website states April 2019 is the deadline by which all notifications must be done through the internet,  We will beat that deadline by at least a year.

&gt;George: we don't care. We literally can't work without it. The paper solution closes on 1st September. 

Currently, medical communications with central and local government are sent by paper form to the relevant government department. Smith Medical either write theirs by hand or have some other printing solution because they would spend an extra £10 per user per year license for our firms module. However, they can still input the information directly onto a website. 

&gt;Me: George, DPG here from the development team.  My team can give this top priority and drop everything else to get this done, but there's a full test schedule to go through so we know that the data will be submitted correctly.  If it's wrong, you'll get a fine.  Until we can get this tested, you can just enter the data live onto the website. Would that be a good compromise?

&gt;George: not acceptable. Our data clerk doesn't trust the internet so she won't use it. Look, we don't care about the testing. Just get it to us. 

&gt;Boss:  if you can send us a signed fax stating that you'll pilot this for us and agree to skip the full testing and use the untested, uncertified module on your system then we'll put a rush on this for you. Bear in mind that your contract excludes bespoke modules, so you'll need to meet the full development costs of £25,000. I'd need a signed invoice for that too before we can proceed. 

&gt;George:  Whatever. It's important

One Month Later...

Somehow, we managed to compress 3 months of development into 3 weeks and performed our development testing, which it scraped through. Our Technical author wrote a manual and a step-by-step guide.  Minor pixel mis-alignments were not fixed, there are three spelling mistakes and the error handling is ropey but I plan to rewrite portions of it before the end of the year.  The installation happened on the morning of 4th September (as it was the Monday and the customer didn't want an installation on the Friday). I sat back and waited. 

Sure enough, a visit from Support at just after midday. 

&gt;HD: Smith Medical can't send notifications and requests through their GSI Module. They're getting a 'bad gateway' error. 

&gt;Me: That's not one of our errors.  Sounds like an HTTP error code.  get them to check their internet settings and try again.

After lunch I get the story from the support manager. The woman submitting the documents- who distrusts the internet - has it disabled on her pc. Despite the customer specification, user guide, help features and previous email chain mentioning it, she's attempting to send data over the internet to a Secure web portal using reversible encryption, all without internet. She also has an old computer (running windows Vista) that's so slow it can barely run our software. The message encryption takes her 5 minutes per message. It should take around a second or so. They also want a refund, which the director will not be honouring as ""they insisted"".

Update:  Boss rang me today (Sunday) and told me that after he met with George from Smith Medical on Saturday and showed him the transcript of the call, that they knew it had to be sent over the internet.  Their clerk is going on long-term sick as she distrusts the internet and won't be forced to use it.

I work for a small software company doing IT and customer service work supporting the users of our order-writing software.

We brought on a new company 6 months or so ago, and along with it, came a sales  rep we'll call Virginia.

Virginia is 75 years old, ""not good with computers"", but has the best sense of humor and understanding I've ever had from a client. Every time she calls in she's always got something to say, which usually ends in a ""I hope you've got your Vallium nearby!"", And considers us all Wizards.

We recently updated our software, and sent an email out notifying users of this. She calls in yesterday, and we chat it up while I explain to her that yes, this was a real email, not spam, and that she should in fact update her program.

She says ""Ok, I'm going to try to be a big girl and update this myself, but stay by the phone!""

A few minutes go by, and the phone rings, sure enough, it's her on the Caller ID, so I pick up without using the standard greeting, and say ""Hey, Virginia!""

She responds, ""Darn, how did you recognize me with my hat and fake mustache on!?""

I lost it for a bit. Having a long week full of incompetent, ignorant, or intentionally destructive users was washed away because this little old lady told the most Dad-like joke over the phone.

SensesNumbed,Threaten to Email Your Boss? Don't do that! I'll do it FOR you!,"Happy Friday 

In my environment, we have a system whereby you call Technical Operations (hybrid NOC, level 1 group, NOT ME), then they you say who you are, and we give a callback. No callback? No ticket. Our staff is highly trained to hang up on you if we can't verify who you are. When you can't be verified by that, you call your manager, who then has to verify you and your number for a callback. Colloquially, we call it StaffAuth.

I get the ticket returned with clarity about calling for StaffAuth. I didn't look at the ticket for 4 business days and get a message back from her:

&gt;I really need this issue fixed, do you have an eta for my Manager?  Thanks

I do my due diligence, but the troubleshooting is simple. If your number is correct, and in the correct format *you will receive a phone call*. If you have no signal, you will not receive a call. If you have blocked our numbers, you will not receive a call. If you reroute your number, you will not receive a call. I confirm her number and inform her of as much. But something feels off; I remember a few weeks ago my colleagues had a similar problem with someone just flat blocking our numbers. I asked about it, and wouldn't you know, its the **SAME USER**. I'm no fool, I know what the problem is now.

I get an email back this morning:
&gt; I went down to get my phone checked and all possible numbers were unblocked by Bob Ross, regardless it needs to be worked out because I need to authenticate.  If you are not able to assist let me know so that I can inform my supervisor.

Oh no! Don't threaten me with contacting your manager!!!!!

I'll do it for you! I send an email back, this time with my manager and her manager as CC:

&gt; Please bring your phone down to Desktop Services so we can physically troubleshoot.

The turnaround was amazing! I got an email back from her, having removed the managers from the chain saying that she has removed a bunch of numbers from her blocked list and that she would like me to test.

ITSupportZombie,Tales From Aircraft Maintenance: Take off your pants and Jacket,"In a past life I was an Avionics Technician, and I have seen/done some crazy sh-tuff.  Some of these stories I can share with you now.

I was a chilly morning on our very windy flight line.  We had several jets launching simultaneously this morning and I was too tired for bull excrement.  I get a call out to a jet for an obviously bullshit issue.

Note: Aircrews will choose not to fly at times for reasons of their own.  Sometimes the pilots are hung over, sometimes they just don’t feel like flying that day or sometimes the per diem where we are is a lot nicer than where they are going.

It has been more than 10 years since this occurred, so I don’t remember what system it was that had the “issue”.  

As soon as I got the call that one of my systems was broken, I was pull out of the de-icer truck (thankfully) to go fix what is broken.  I put all my cold weather gear back on for the 100+ yard walk to the jet in question.  As I board the jet and climb up to the flight deck (can’t call it a cockpit anymore as someone might get offended), I am greeted with a wall of sweltering heat.  This crew, in summer weight flight suits is running the heat on high, full power heat.  I could cook my lunch on one of those heat vents.  Upon arrival, I ask the pilot what the issue is and he proceeds to make up some obvious BS story about a non-existent malfunction on a system that is not mission essential.  

Yep, this jet is broke for per diem.

Sadly, I am not able to call them on their bullshit and proceed to troubleshoot like a good little airman.

I run through my troubleshooting steps, shedding layers as I go.  My shirt is soaked through with sweat.  First my hat, then gloves, then jacket, thermal layer.  I am now down to my t-shirt and BDU pants (I told you this was a while ago).  The really cute 1LT co-pilot asks me what I am taking off next and the rest of the crew stops and watches me to see my answer.  I look her dead in the eye with a mischievous grin and tell her if this system isn’t fixed soon, my pants are coming off due to the heat in this plane.

Suddenly the pilot is opening the windows and “wants to check one more thing”.  Magically, the system becomes functional.  I walk back down to the cargo bay and gear up again to go back into the cold, knowing that I will be freezing my ass off for the rest of the day due to the wet under shirt.  At least I have the satisfaction of knowing that the jet launched on time and this crew will not take advantage of more government money in the form of per diem.  Sometimes it is the little victories in life that are the most satisfying.

ITSupportZombie,Tales from Aircraft Maintenance: Couldn't pin down the problem,"In a past life, I was an Avionics technician in the Air Force.  There were many fun/difficult/taxing/joyous/stressful/exciting memories to be had.  Some of these incidents I can even share with all of you.

This story happened several years ago in a place far far away that I am very glad I put behind me.

In this case it was a warm summer’s day, the kind of day that makes me glad I work outside.  It was warm but not hot, the sun was out but not blindingly so.  We had just enough work to keep us busy so management wouldn’t feel the need to create work for us (a common occurrence).  It was a good day.  Then the radio went off, we had a jet on approach with inoperative radar.  Radar never breaks on this airframe, ever.  I am kind of excited to work on a system that never breaks.  I love digging deep and troubleshooting.  I am now happier than a pig in excrement.

The plane lands and I get the details from the aircrew.  “Intermittent failure of radar display on takeoff and approach.”  This is an interesting one.  Once the crew departs, I gather up all the tools and test equipment needed for this job and head out to my new home for the rest of the day.

My radiation danger cones are set, I radioed to report that I was radiating and ran up my systems. I am ready to attack this problem, this jet will not defeat me.

Everything checks out, all tests passed.  Day one ends and I go home.

The next day, the jet is ready to take off and they abort, no radar video.  The jet wins this round, but I’m not done.

So, back I go to this jet, set up my safety area and proceed as before.

I reseat all easily accessed connectors, once again everything passes.  At this point I wonder if this is actually a radar issue at all.  I confer with my supervisor and tell him what I have done so far, and he proceeds to take over the job with me as his minion.  We run up the engines to duplicate the problem as close to what the crew experienced as possible and still no issues.  He has many great ideas that do nothing to address the problem or do anything but burn up time.

Several hours pass, I have a genius idea, bang on sh1t.  I banged on every box that house the radar or systems that in interfaced, we get a blip of video and then it goes out entirely.  I have now duplicated the problem.  Yes, breaking stuff moves me towards a solution.  

With the engines running, I reseat the connectors for the system once again and close the avionic bay door.  Due to the suction of the cooling, the door slams and video returns.  SUCCESS! We have narrowed down the problem from half of the jet (this is not a small jet) down to one avionic bay.  Of course, most of the parts are not easily accessible in this rack, so lots of parts need to be removed and that takes time.  Enough time has passed that my shift is over only 2 hours after I was supposed to go home.  We will call this round a tie.

Now on day 3, we attack this issue right away, I am tired of seeing this bird on the ramp.  It is taunting me.  Several hours into my day, the sun is out and baking this metal fuselage and me sitting in the dark with it.  Checking individual pins on mounts.  I finally found the cause; one pin on a pin block was about 1mm out of place.  Just one pin, slightly out caused all this effort.  I am victorious.

Once this jet is put back together, we test it, run every test in the book and a few that aren’t.  Everything looks good.  We sign off the jet and a crew is scheduled for the next day.  I, of course, stand by ready for this problem to rear its ugly head.  The crew runs the pre-flight, everything good.  Run up engines, everything is good.  Taxis, everything is still good.  The jet takes off and everything is still good.  I beat this jet and it feels amazing to watch it fly away.  I genuinely miss that job satisfaction of watching a jet go up, knowing I got it there.

My boss of course took credit for the work and conveniently left me out of the report.

Edit:  I did change out the whole system, twice.  That was my reference to my supervisor being unhelpful.

This didn't improve the mouse slowness, so I had her try a different mouse, with no change. I discovered in device manager that the USB controllers weren't recognized, the drivers were corrupt.

So just uninstall then slap in new drivers right? Nope.

After the installer prompted a restart may be required, she held the power button. Not the start menu button​, the physical button. In the middle of a critical driver installation.

Guess who corrupted her hard drive? It would just keep looping to the ""do you want to start windows normally"" screen. Icing on the cake is she kept selecting the wrong options without telling me what she was doing, so she tripped bitlocker and *locked* the drive on top of corrupting it.

She then got very abrasive with me (""WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE ISSUES?!"") when I told her that was it, I need to set up a new system.

She can't match shapes, takes 20-30 minutes to follow basic instructions, and doesn't know how to use the start menu to restart or shut down.

And she's the senior trainer for most new hires.

Merkuri22,It says it's offline.,"&gt; **Me:** Hello, little one.  *My hands stroked the surface of the sleek black machine.*  Did you miss me?

I opened the lid of the laptop, and the electronic glow bathed my face.

It had been a long weekend.  My husband and I along with our three year old had spent the weekend on Cape Cod with friends.  The Cape has been fighting off the advances of the evil Internet for a decade, now, and though it is slowly losing that battle I had opted to remain neutral and hadn't brought much in the way of technology.  My laptop had spent the weekend at home alone.

Although it had been fun, there had been very little sleep, what with us having to share a room with our three year old.  I think I averaged five hours of sleep per night, and most of that was punctuated by toddler snores, sleepy mumbles about fluffy cars, at least one instance of falling off the bed, and the occasional misplaced elbow from my husband.  

So I was exhausted and technology starved.  The cranky munchkin was finally asleep.  The unpacking was done.  The only thing I wanted to do right then was have a little peace and quiet with a bowl of saltwater taffy and my laptop for a few minutes before bed.  I booted up Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and picked up my controller.

I hadn't been playing long when the second human being I'm responsible for made his way over to stand behind me.  I waited for a moment to see if my husband would go away on his own (*stand still, they can only sense movement!*).  When that didn't happen I rolled my head back and turned my tired eyes up at him with a look that said, ""If you ask me a technology question I will feed you your own entrails.""  Or, at least that's what I tried to get across.  It's possible the look just said, ""Me tired. You have pillow?""

&gt; **Husband:** So... um.  The printer won't print.  It says it's offline.

Instinctively, I look at the subject of my husband's dilemma.  It's a network printer/scanner combo, plugged into an Ethernet cable, and it's sitting on my desk about 14 inches from my laptop.  As my eyes light upon it, I feel the tech support part of my brain start to spin up with the whine of an old hard drive.

&gt; **Me:** *(Thinks)* No, no, not now!

I couldn't help it.  My eyes unfocus.  Despite my best effort I went into debug mode.  My tired brain started spitting out questions and things to check.  Did the IP address decide to change again?  Is the router offline?  Did his machine get kicked off of the wi-fi?  Is something stuck in the queue?  

I stare at the bane of my existence through glossy eyes as I will myself to stop troubleshooting.  The desire to *fix things* and the need to disembowel Dark Jedi clumsily wrestle with each other in my head like two rednecks who are too stinking drunk to properly fight.  And the desire to sleep was waiting in a dark corner with a tire iron, preparing to mug the winner.

&gt; **Husband:** It doesn't have to be right now.  You can look at it later when you're done with your game.

I blink and open my mouth to say that I will look at it later when I finally realize what I've been staring at.  The power button, which usually shines with a cheery green glow, is dark.

I reach over and hit said button.  The printer hums to life and starts to light up and go through its booting routine.  I turn back to my game, pick up the controller, and say without looking back at my husband,

&gt; **Me:** It was offline.",talesfromtechsupport,1985,1505868404
Thyri,WE NEED IT NOW...in three weeks...tomorrow...without testing...,"I will try and keep this brief...I am still trying to figure out if I am going mad or not. (for any colleagues reading this...sorry if I shouted today or if I do so tomorrow!)

Brief history - As a software company, we have worked with our biggest client to create some software for them that basically makes their lives easier. They have had it set up as a test for a long time. It is important to note that the client has signed off on the completed product (I have the documents!)

The Story: In July they said they wanted in place as soon as possible as it was urgent that they went live. After a lot of back and forth, we agree on a date...but they cancel 

They then say they want it in August (prime holiday period), fair enough, third week in August is agreed (after lots of toys being thrown around). This date comes around but there is an issue with the setup. Data left in place, users not updated. They then tell me they are not going live for another three-four weeks! So much for urgency!

Issues are fixed (ha!) and I book user upgrade dates. A date a week later is booked but cancelled again. 

They then request (on the same day) to do it in the evening of that day...I naturally say no not enough notice and it's put off for a few days.

A little background on this - the tool they have is one that effectively allows two different sets of data to talk to each other and share info between offices. So BOTH databases need to be able to connect to the third database. On the initial set-up in August, I say (for the millionth time) please test the connection from the other data that I have no access to).

Last week they update the users (hooray!) and today they say to me that they can't connect to the database from the one that I have no access to and they need it NOW because they are going live...tomorrow...yep...tomorrow...

I have spent my day fixing connections and permissions and fielding emails and get it working. Then I get a snagging list of things not requested in the first place (and of course they are urgent) and this absolute gem of a question:

&gt;I want to set up a shared file location but not give users access to it from Windows

So I sat and looked at my computer, reached over for my (now very cold) cup of coffee and start on this masterpiece...I am done for the day but more will occur tomorrow I am sure.

carnizzle,Why I can drink vodka like water.,"Vacant stare.  
phone rings.  
IT support.  

I picked up my phone to an irate lady who was seemingly annoyed at her PC and by extension the IT department as a whole.   
She was rather annoyed at the fact her PC kept locking her out of the system.   
Unlocking an account is 2 seconds work and I should have been back to surfing reddit in under a minute, however this user wanted to know why her account was locking out.   
I informed the lady that an account disables a user account if an incorrect password is entered a 4 or 5 times in a row.  
    

Being told you are wrong can cause many emotions from people.  
I could hear the screams in my head of many words and phrases and acts of violence i want to employ.  
As the consummate professional i am however I explained again that all account lockouts come from incorrect passwords. At which point I receive a full tirade on how this user was an expert at putting their password in and it must be something else not password related.  
  

Pause,  Breathe, squeeze line ever so slightly in the hope that you have gained the ability to kill people through the phone.     
  

I continue and attempt to explain that its not necessarily her inputting the password incorrectly .   
I tell her that anything that has your user id and wants to authenticate you may under certain circumstances lock you out, 
I gave her a number of reasons for account lockout, a number of reasons to deflect from the ""user error"" one which seemed to upset her. The idea was to placate her, get her off the phone and continue with my day, but no she just got more annoyed.   
  

Apparently having saved credentials on another machine or having a PC that would know your details and uses them on your behalf was ridiculous and should not be allowed.  
All through this the user is telling me how she never gets her password wrong.  
I grab ALtools and look at the lockoutstatus because she is so sure its not her I think it may be something odd.   
I tell her to log in,   
  

She gets her password wrong.  
  
  

  
At that moment I pictured walking through corridors going from office to office with a large bore shotgun firing at anything that moved, a fine red warm mist coating my face.  
  
  

The user then manages to log in on the 2nd attempt, slowly i recompose and ask if there are any other issues.  
She needs her mail sorting...  
I log into her machine and point her mail profile to the exchange and let it go.  
After a few moments it asks the user for her password.   
I can hear the sigh.  She wants to know why it keeps asking for her passwords.  
I explain that in order to get mail you have to authenticate who are.  
Her account works she restarts outlook and it asks for her password.  dutifully she puts it in. Then a few seconds later it asks again.  I hear a frustrated noise down the phone.   
I explain it always asks twice the first time, its a thing.  
She asks me if she has to put her password in every time she opens her mail.  
I explain that at the moment this is the case due to the transitions we are going through with our exchange systems and other such things.   
  

She then asks me if there is a way the computer can remember her password...  
    

The circle is now complete, noise is replaced by the wash of the sea in my ears, in the distance i hear the screams louder and louder as the world moves into focus the screams now drown out all the white noise, I look around and notice its me thats screaming.   
  

  
I ask her if there is anything else i can help her with and to call us if the problem happens again.  
  
   

eye twitch.  
phone rings.   
Next call.

$ITwannabe: mid-thirty guy who was my go-to-man for IT relevant stuff, since he was the boss of teh IT crowd. (I shit you not, he could´ve been in that series.)

$me: Le me, yours truly.
_______________________________________


First week of work. I am excited. I get to do real IT stuff! I just might get to call myself an IT guy after this 6-month gig! (I was studying at the time and needed the money and real life experience. University might give you the basics, but it ain´t givin´ you shit about the truth.)


I get my laptop on Day 1. It looks pretty old and it is pretty old, but heck, whoever designed it did not get all Scrouge McDuck on the inside. 16gb RAM, Quadcore with 3,6GHz, and even a very decent graphics unit. I was truly impressed. This (from the looks of it) old piece of junk was way more powerful than my tower at home.


I remembered what Reddit taught me, and I write the mail mentioned in part 1. After that, I get myself all the stuff I need - Access, some Google searches about Access, and coffee - and set out to work.


My plan back then was simple: Ask what they need, get it down on paper, draw some diagrams to make sure we understand each other, and then type it down. Easy, right?


Yup. In my imagination.


After the first week, I had some ideas about what Access can do, and what not. First thing I found out: Access is not as bad as I was always told it is. Yeah, it has its ups and downs, but hey, as long as you stay in one country, all is well. (More like, one LAN, but meh.) And the fact you can create forms by clicking them together is just awesome - it saves a lot of time, is easy to understand and all in all quite enjoyable.


After week one, I meet $boss for some talking about how far I got and what I think about the whole project.


&gt; $boss: Hey $me, how´s it going? What are you working on right now?

&gt; $me: Hey! I´m just constructing the forms you wanted, with all the information and stuff. Have to say, it´s quite easy!

&gt; $boss (laughing, which made my heart bounce once or twice) Yeah, we thought so, too! But say, did you talk with $ITwannabe?

&gt; $me: No. Should I?

&gt; $boss: Well, he is responsible for all the equipment and so on, and you told us that you´d need a server and also entrance to the database. You should talk to him ASAP.

&gt; $me: All right, I´ll do just that.


And of she goes. I try not to stare, but damn, it´s hard.


A few minutes (and a coffee/cigarette break) later I walk down to the office where IT recides. I knock at the door - no answer. I knock again - no answer. I try to open the door - and it opens up.


$ITwannabe stares at me as if I am his nightmare come true. He sits in front of two huge monitors (35´? Heck, I don´t know) and is just in conversation with another quite attractive woman. His stare tells me enough - I just interrupted a very important business meeting. And, just perhaps, his chances with her, because she smiles at me.


&gt; $ITwannabe: What do you want?!

&gt; $me (a bit confused): Uhm, sorry, I did not want to disturb you... I did knock two times, and -

&gt; $ITwannabe: When no one answers, you don´t come in!

&gt; $hotchick: Oh, stop it. You know we have an open door policy. So, what is the problem?

&gt; $me (not sure if I should just run now or tough it out): Well, I am working for $boss and I need access to a database. She told me to come here.

&gt; $hotchick: Well, she is right, but we need a few more minutes, if you don´t mind?

&gt; $me: No, of course not. I´ll wait outside.


So I go outside again, close the door, and wait.


And wait some more.


And wait.


When my beard started to reach my shoes, I decide that it is time for some coffee. I start to walk away when ´lo, the door opens! $hotchick emerges, gives me a warm smile and a ""He´s all yours!"" before rushing off.


I go back inside, and $ITwannabe does not look pissed anymore. I am quite relieved -  I need this guy.


&gt; $me: Sorry again for disturbing you before -

&gt; $ITwannabe: Don´t mention it, happens all the time. So, what do you need?

&gt; $me: I need access to this one database for -

&gt; $ITwannabe (clicks something): This database?


I look at the screen. I´m astonished. I´m shocked. What did this wizard do just now?


What I see is a browser window with a beautiful made website. It has all the fields I clicked together for my Access form (at least most of them); the important bit is, the fields are *filled out*. That is practically my work, already done.


&gt; $me: Uhm... what´s this?

&gt; $ITwannabe: This is our new software we are developing. Funny, huh?


He goes on with why they develop that system, how it is supposed to link together all of the departments and their information, and so on and so forth. He shows me a lot of what it can do already - and it´s brilliant. It is more or less the stuff I wanted to do with SQL and C#. Guess what it was written in...?


After giving me the full tour, he explains that my work really is unnecessary and I should talk with $boss about it, since he does not like her and she does not like him. Also, he can give me clearence for the database, though, as he said, it really is not necessary. Furthermore, he has a lot of work to do with that system, which (as he told me in confidence) he pretty much did all alone in a few months, and whoever tells me otherwise has no clue.


I go back to $boss. I feel like an animal baloon which some bastard had let a lot of air out of - really deflated and really unhappy.


&gt; $me: Hey $boss, there seem to be some changes in my plans...

&gt; $boss: What happened?

&gt; $me: Well, $ITwannabe already has a system which does more or less everything you want my system to do.

&gt; $boss: Yeah, I know. And?

&gt; $me (by now totally confused and bewildered): Well... I don´t know! Why should I do the same thing when it is already in development?

&gt; $boss: Because that system is in development since 3 years.


I stare at her, not believing what I just heard.

&gt; $boss: Did $ITwannabe told you how much he did on it? I expect he did. Well, here is what he does: He gathers all the information - just like you did - which fields will be needed, and so on. Then he sends this infomation to the corporation which writes all the code, and they implement it.

&gt;$me: Wait, wait - you mean, he does not write a single line of code?

&gt; $boss: Not that I am aware of. He is lazy, really. A real snob. Anyway, we continue as planned.


And then she goes away to do whatever she does and just leaves me standing, wondering which hell I have entered.

win4free,Why use SQL? We got Access!,"So, I just read a comment where people said that you should get EVERYTHING in writing. Luckily, you can read this all over this forum and therefor, I did just that for my internship with a big, big company in Germany. Lucky me. Well, here goes!


_______________________________


First of, location. It´s a big company located in Erlangen (near Nuremberg) and they do a ton of stuff - in my case, turbines for energy buildings like gas turbines, gas-steam-combined etc. I was hired to make sure all of their staff share the same information they got from possible clients with all the other people - since some were only selling gas turbines, others only steam, and if both **could** be sold to the same customer, the person who got that information more often withheld it instead of sharing it to have a bigger bonus later that year. Guess what? That part of the company is recently in decline.


So, my job: Build a database where everything is registered. Easy enough, I did some SQL in school and university, shouldn´t be that hard.


Yeah, I was a dumb kid.


____________________________

The persons:

$boss - a young woman, about 30, who was nice and pretty hot tbh, but had no clue of IT.

$coworker - another woman, in her late 40s, really nice and had scratched at the top of IT stuff recently.

$me - that shouldn´t be too hard to figure out.


______________________________

I got to the building early in late October. It was cold, it was windy, I was pissed because rain came down just when I left the bus. I walk the last few hundred metres to the building, enter and wait for my contact - $coworker.

$coworker comes. She´s lovely. She´s nice. I think to myself: *Damn, this might just be a nice job for once.* We go through the rain to get to my first meeting with $boss, where she wants to explain to me what my job will be - I was not hired back then, but I was sure of myself that I could land that job.

I meet $boss and think: *Heck yeah, she´s nice too AND good-looking!* We talk a bit about what I´ve done already, what I can do and so on. They tell me that I made a good impression and I can start working for them, so what is my plan?

&gt;$me: Well, I´ve done some stuff in this company from time to time, summer jobs and whatnot. I know you use SQL in most places, so -

&gt;$boss: Could you use Microsoft Access?

&gt;$me (taken aback): Uhm, yeah, I guess. But why?

&gt;$boss: Well, we looked into it for the last two weeks and it seems to do exactly what we want it to!


Oh hell.


&gt;$me: Well, yeah, I´d need some time since I´ve never worked with Access, but it should totally be possible. You get the data all here in Germany, right?

&gt;$boss: Yeah, that´s right, all is send to us!

&gt;$me: Send to you?

&gt;$coworker: Yes, with Excel files.


Lord, have mercy.


&gt;$me: Okay. Well, it should be possible to import that stuff into Access, no problem. But still, I *know* the company. You use SQL databases everywhere. I strongly recommend we use an SQL database with some C# interface opened in a browser or something. It´ll be better in the long run, I can guarantee that.

&gt;$boss: Well, we´d still like you to do it in Access.

&gt;$me (defeated): Well, all right, if that is what you want, I´ll make it happen.


So, a week later I return for my first day of office. I remember reading stuff on reddit, how to get everything in writing, and I think to myself: *Damn, that´s probably not a bad idea. Time to write some mails.*


Off I go, opening Exchange and writing down everything for my boss: What are the requirements? Why don´t you want to use SQL? What is my job in your eyes?


Back comes a mail:

- All information is located in Germany.

- Information from other countries come with an Excel file, so I have to make sure it can be imported. (Easy enough.)

- Access shall be used because ""we know how it works."" (""We"" meaning $boss [no clue at all] and $coworker [fiddled around with it a bit, some clues there].)

- My job is to make it happen.


I create a folder and call it ""fall-back plan"". I copy that mail there, and leave the original one where it is.


I feel safe.


And I was. At least for a bit.

cyanghost109-,"User puts every computer on wifi, wifi subsequently fails","I work in IT support with one other coworker. A user at one of our sites couldn't connect to the network since the cabling had gone bad.* The reason was unknown as we were both in school and no IT staff was able to assist, but we had access to our tech support email through our phone so we checked that.

The operations supervisor at this location emailed us asking for the domain password so he could join this user's computer to the wireless network so she could get some work done in the meantime until we are able to come onsite and troubleshoot. Personally, I don't care what the reason is, handing out the domain administrator password at will to users is an absolute no. However, my coworker decided to give them the domain password, thus he was able to connect this user's desktop to the wifi.

All of the desktops at this location have wifi built in. The operations supervisor then proceeded to go to every damn machine in the building and disable the wired connection and put them on the wifi because ""it's probably faster that way"". This building has about 20 computers, all joined to a domain with folder redirection and various other policies enabled. As you can imagine, high throughput is a must and wireless is going to struggle. 

After he did this, we promptly received an email saying ""The entire network is down!!! No one can do anything!"". I figured it was high time to leave class and go take a look. Once I get there, I verify that no machines are able to do anything. While troubleshooting, I then realized that every machine I looked at was on wifi. I about died.

Needless to say, I put everyone back on wired, changed the domain admin password and told the supervisor never to do that again.

TL;DR: One user's wired connection went bad. Her supervisor asked for the domain administrator account to put her on wifi, my coworker gives it to him. Supervisor then proceeds to put every damn computer on the wifi. Wifi explodes, I fix it and go home and contemplate what I'm doing with my life for a few hours.

Rik_Koningen,My very first ticket or I should have ran when I had the chance.,"Today for your reading pleasure a tale I've shared quite a few times now in conversation but never publicly. Having read stuff here for years I think you'll like it.

I was just a young lad going into IT, I'd done some tech support before but nothing professional just the usual family and friends support. But I started studying to do IT professionally and now I'd got an internship or part time job, I honestly don't remember which came first but I do distinctly remember my very first ever ticket.

&gt;$Boss ""Hey Rik the difficult ""lady"" (said with as much disdain as is humanly possible) is complaining about office I'm  sorry to make this your first ticket but I really can't be fucked dealing with her."" 

Yes he did really word it similarly to that different language but similarly impolite and unprofessional. Looking back this should have caused me to be very careful but I was young and stupid so I just played along.

&gt;Me ""Sure thing boss, would you mind telling me beforehand why she is so bad that you just ""Can't be fucked dealing with her""?

&gt;$Boss ""Well you'll know soon anyway, she doesn't know how to show gratitude and is the most obnoxiously offensive person. I honestly don't know how she has a job, must be fucking the CEO or something. 

This boss was generally a good guy but professionalism wasn't his strong point. He was too honest about everything and as such was not destined for a long career much as I liked him.

So I go over to her desk where she's sitting looking very annoyed.

&gt;Me ""Good afternoon my name is Rik Koningen I've been asked to....""

&gt;$Upset ""I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE YOU NITWIT NOW FIX MY PC!""

I should have gotten out of there right then and there. But again young and stupid so I stuck around.

&gt;Me ""Sure thing m'lady just let me get to the computer""

She was sitting there in the way completely blocking access so I couldn't do much. Also I did use the local m'lady equivalent just to see how she'd react, she didn't even seem to notice. At the time this saddened me now I'm glad nothing happened.

&gt;$Upset *moves out of the way not getting out of her chair so I have to work on the PC standing*

&gt;Me ""would you mind if I borrow your chair? It's much more comfortable... *gets cut of*

&gt;$Upset ""NO YOU WON'T HOW DARE YOU WALK IN HERE LIKE YOU OWN THE PLACE BREAK EVERYTHING AND THEN HAVE THE BALLS TO ASK TO BE GIVEN MY CHAIR. DISGUSTING!""

&gt;Me *sighs* ""very well""

5 Minutes or so pass resetting a few things and looking over settings. It was quite a simple fix in the end she'd just hit some hotkey changing a setting so a simple setting reset fixed it.

&gt;Me ""There you go all fixed the problem was... *cut off again*

&gt;$Upset ""THE PROBLEM IS YOU IT SWINE KEEP MESSING WITH ME, YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY DON'T YOU!?!? YOU ARE LITERALLY WORSE THAN CANCER GET OUT OF MY SIGHT!

At this point I leave and return to my boss who offers me a coffee.

texasgunowner12,"To fix printer, remove child.","So the company I work for has a large number of offices in the southwest and a few in the northwest of the country. 

Some of our northwestern offices have no daycare centers anywhere near them so they provide their own for the parents at a small fee. 

This is important later. 

Yesterday I got onto a tech support call from said office about a printer that was no longer working. No matter what it just refused to take any papers in the paper feeder. We use the paper feeder for legal documents. Since legal length paper is much longer, it is easier to just use feeders than to buy printers that have trays for the legal documents. 

So I check the software side by remoting in to user's PC and using printer's web portal. First I just try to see if I can get it to feed. No dice. I try soft resetting the printer through the web portal. Nuh uh. I tried having user hard reset it and loading up the default configuration for said printer. Nope. 

So at this point I must assume hardware and file a ticket with local IT support. 

Today I get the resolution to the ticket. 

&gt; Error/s: Paper feeder was non operational, second paper tray stuck in place, pink hue on white paper when printed. 

&gt; Cause of error/s: Gummi Bears shoved into paper feeder, Soft drink spill causing second tray to be stuck closed, Twizzlers™ partially melted in return feeder causing pink hue on papers. 

&gt; Actions to correct: Replaced rollers in paper feeder and removed Gummi Bears. Properly washed all sugar from second paper tray. Replaced return feeder rollers and removed Twizzlers™ from return feed. 

&gt; Recommendations for future corrective action: Childproof locks on printer room door. Remove children from facility. 

I read this four times before forwarding it to my boss. I immediately locked my screen and walked into his office telling him to read it.

&gt; $Boss - Well the solution is simple. Remove child, fix printer, profit.

The scene:

A California Desert, A helpdesk in a tent surrounded by barbed wire

 This network has a red(secret) and green(unclassified) side which is relevant later. The network also uses SNMP to show status reports of red(bad) or green(good).

We set up a network which provides phones and facebook and other communications in record time.which leads to people being assigned to different duties then normal, like helldesk. I happened to be on the desk when a call comes in on the red side phone from CPT_O. 

""Hey! The red side phones are down!"" Exclaims the unknown caller.
""Ummm the one you are using right now?"" I ask in confusion.
""Yeah, you are showing Red here so your phones are down."" the still unknown caller rants.

At this point $ToonBoss takes interest and takes over the call,
proceeding to treat this mystery caller like a cherry private and eventually finding out that no, our phones aren't down but a snmp address is wrong. address changed and Hey it works!

I take back the call for closing thinking I was talking to a private when I get hit with ""I am the signal captain for sister battalion and your phones were broke."" Record Scratch.exe We both treated someone higher then us like a fresh boot, So when I end the call with a ""Glad to help, Sir"" $ToonBoss looks concerned for a second, then starts laughing. $ToonBoss took the brunt of CPT_O's inevitable wrath at being treated like a private and I continued to gather stories for this sub.

TL;DR: Mystery caller calls on phone he claims is down, treated like a private for acting like one. end of call turns out he is higher up the food chain and not happy about that.

JamesMBuddy123,The time I accidentally allowed Marketing to spam themselves,"Hello TFTS, LTL, FTP etc etc.

This is a tale of how I accidentally let Marketing send themselves over 100,000 emails in about 10 minutes.

I was developing a tool that lets them send out emails to people. Lots of emails, fairly quickly, because marketing. It was a system I was pretty proud of, because I'd built both the front end and back end from scratch.

One day I get an email from Marketing saying something like the following:

&gt;Our inbox is getting tons of the same emails from your system, plz help.

This made me scratch my head. I could understand if they'd somehow sent themselves a whole bunch of emails by putting their email address in the wrong column or something but the fact that these were the same emails time after time was puzzling.

Until I twigged to the realisation that something they'd requested recently was the ability to make an email send recur. So they could set up a bunch of emails to run on a cron job essentially. I went over and asked them how they'd set up the last job, specifically if they'd accidentally selected the recurrence option, which they swore blind they hadn't. A quick database search later confirmed that they actually had managed to select the recurrence option, and that this job was being run on a recurrence schedule of `* * * * *`. 

For those of you that can't read cron expressions, that will trigger every minute.

Turns out that in my infinite wisdom, the `div` containing the recurrence checkbox, extended the whole width of the container it was in. If someone clicked in line with the checkbox no matter how far to the right it was, would select the checkbox, and the default value for how often the emails recurred was 1 minute.

I was soon asked to hide the recurrence option and make it visible on a button press to prevent a recurrence.",talesfromtechsupport,3055,1505101911
mountainwombat,"Shiny side down, SHINY SIDE UP!","I am a semi retired, semi burnt out old tech spending my old age in a small country town supporting a mixed bag of small business, farmers and end users.

I had a simple job that I did for one of the local small businesses. Every year I generated an order list that he sent to his customers in the form of an excel spreadsheet that he attached to an email.  When his clients sent the order sheets back I collated them into a master that he used to plan the next years orders. It worked well for him, with only one problem.

He was not computer literate and needed everything done the same way or he couldn't get it to ""work"". I couldn't persuade him to accept the spreadsheet as an email attachment, or even on a USB stick. So every year I send him a CD with that years spreadsheet on it. Even then he had problems, this is the only time in a year that he has to load a CD, usually inserting the CD in the drive upside down.

To remind him I wrote ""shiny side down"" on the white side of the printable CD that I sent him.

This worked well until one day He replaced his old Macbook with a shiny new  Macbook air. that did not have an inbuilt DVD, so he got the usb superdrive. Suddenly he could not read the CD with his data on it. I burned another copy, making sure it had the shiny side down warning on it and dropped it off to his office. You guessed it he could not read the new disk either. I watched him eject the CD and show me that he had put  the disk in with the shiny side down. He asked what was wrong.

Instead of answering him I added the words ""SHINY SIDE UP!"" to the disk, flipped the superdrive over, and reinserted the CD. He could now read the disk. You see the superdrive has a black plastic side with the apple logo on it, and a metal side. He had placed it on his desk upside down,  with the black side facing up.

**$ITLead** - $Selbens IT lead at this particular company, source of IT related information.

**$VIP** - Some company president or otherwise flagged as “important” person.

**$Manager** - The manager of $MrGoof

&amp;nbsp;

The previous contract had ended, but $Soda had been requested for an extension to finish off the project he was assisting with. With some of $Soda’s contacts they were able to find $Selben another gig for a month helping out on a helpdesk at a different company. Mostly it was filling the position while one of the techs was on LOA (*Leave of Absence*) it was a mid-sized company with most of its employees dealing with sales and working from remote locations (*often on the road*). $Selben was placed on phone support for internal employees, most of the calls were for getting email working on phones, and other basic troubleshooting, things were going fairly normal until…

&amp;nbsp;

$Selbens phone rang.

&gt; $Selben: Thank you for calling, how can I help you?

&gt; $MrGoof: I can’t get email on my phone!

&gt; $Selben: Okay, am I talking to you on that phone or…

&gt; $MrGoof: NO! I’m not stupid, this is a land-line!

&gt; $Selben: Sorry for the misunderstanding… I just wanted to know if you had a signal and network connectivity on your phone.

&gt; $MrGoof: NO! Its fine, just no email!

&gt; $Selben: Okay, have you tried rebooting or asking anyone on the same network if they have a signal?

&gt; $MrGoof: Really?! Just fix it!

&gt; $Selben: I’m trying to I need you…

&gt; $MrGoof: I can’t get email on my laptop either!

&gt; $Selben: Are you somewhere with network access?

&gt; $MrGoof: Yes, I have Wifi - look if your don’t just reset my password I’m going to quit!

&gt; $Selben: I am so sorry about that, one moment - let me check something on my side…

$Selben ran into some issues generating a ticket for the user… Ah there is the issue.

&gt; $Selben: I think I found the problem, you may want to check with your manager…

&gt; $MrGoof: Really?! What B$%# S#%@ you wait right there!

&gt; $Selben: I…

The super quiet sound of being put on hold was now filling $Selbens ears with dread, he waited. After a minute or so $MrGoof’s voice and another.

roflcopter-pilot,Error cause: Customer died at unconvenient time,"A coworker of mine supports the most important software product in use at our company, responsible for pretty much all of our customer business. It's a true all-in-one product, ranging from manging leads for marketing over nearly every aspect of serving customers every day to billing and statistics.


Recently he got a ticket from a manager of a customer service related department, who has to sign off extraordinary money transactions to clients based on work of his team. Such money transactions are a fairly normal thing and happen for lots of legitimate reasons, but naturally you want someone to crosscheck this.  
The ticket stated that he had received a clearly erroneous transaction in his clearing list in our system - according to what the daily database batch had calculated the customer should receive several million. Our customer really should be reimbursed, but only for a few hundred, he had found out by manually doing the math. Now he wanted to report this bug and asked us to look into it.


Very confused by this, because this part of the system is something that runs rock solid since forever, my coworker got to work and looked into the issue. Quickly he determined that the database entries were all okay, what's wrong is the calculation performed by the daily batch which creates the transfer orders... whyever. So he involved the software manufacturer and together they spent considerable time investigating the issue further.


Today came the breakthrough:  

It turned out that the day an employee had input the data which automatically resulted in the payment order to our customer, we were notified that our customer unfortunately had deceased. Another employee fed this information into our system. Meanwhile the daily batch happened to be running. Due to a freak coincidence it processed this customer's pending payment order in the *very same moment* her service period data changed (apparently the value of the database field storing start and end time of service is retrieved twice during the calculation, once in one function and miliseconds later in another) which caused the whole calculation to go wrong, an overflow happened thanks to poor error handling, et voila - the sum was suddenly gigantic.

So you could say our customer died at the wrong time... triggering a bug that was undetected for years because it can only happen in this very specific case.",talesfromtechsupport,3101,1504864791
Tension27,"No, We Will Not Stay at Your Office During the Storm.","Good Day TFTS and what a crazy week it's been so far. For a quick reminder, the company I work for is based out of Orlando, FL. As such, you can only imagine the sheer panic that many of our clients are currently going through. While many of us are local here in central Florida, some of our clients have offices located off the coast, Miami being the big one right now. We run backups of servers daily, PC's are extra, but we cover them as well so should something happen to their systems there, we do have the ability to get them up and running again through virtual clients while we get physical systems restored. One of our smaller clients in Boca had a bit more of a crazy request for us.

Tension - $me 
Crazy Client Lady - $CCL
My Manager - $Manager

We receive a call yesterday towards our end of hours. $CCL is in a straight panic and the call gets escalated to me as the level 1's don't want to talk her down. Her office is in Boca, pretty much straight in Irma's path, and she's wanting us to check on her entire network, and walk her through exactly what we're doing, step by step. 

&gt;$Me: ""Good Evening $CCL, this is $me from $company. I understand you have some concerns about your network with Irma incoming. Looking over your backups, you're already well up to date on them, and your off-site replications are also showing successful for your servers.""

&gt;$CCL: ""Yes, but what about my entire office?! Do you have backups of all the PC's?! I need to have everyone up and running immediately after this storm hits, I can't afford massive downtime!""

&gt;$Me: ""Unfortunately miss, you opted out of the individual machine backups when you first brought us on as your provider. We have your servers all set in case of the worst case, but the PC's aren't covered. We can add them, but that's an additional fee that will have to be quoted out. I can however, get the process started while you and $manager sort out the quote, and get that approved. Would you like me to conference him in?""

&gt;$CCL: ""There's no time for that! Either you back up all my PC's right now, or you're coming down here to make sure that everything survives the storm in my office!""

I just go silent for a minute put the phone on mute, and call over my manager to my little desk.

&gt;$Me: ""So $CCL here is saying if I don't run immediate unauthorized backups on her PC's, that I have to go to her office and wait out the storm there. I think she's flipped her lid a bit.""

$Manager looks at me like I grew a second and third head simultaneously.

&gt;$Manager: ""She's off her rocker. Give me the phone and I'll straighten this out real quickly.""

I proceed to hand my manager my headset and he takes over the call.

&gt;$Manager: Hello, $CCL? Yes, so I understand that you're concerned about your office, and I see here that $me has verified all backups are functional. However, you're wanting my associate to come to Boca, and sit in your office while one of the strongest hurricanes in history comes through you? Let me ask you a quick question, are you evacuating?""

I hear some unintelligible mumbles through the headset.

&gt;$Manager: ""You are? And you expect my guy here to sit at your office, alone, in that storm, while you leave the area? Do you see the problem with this picture?""

More unintelligible mumbles from the headset.

&gt;$Manager: ""$CCL, we're not paid nearly enough to do that, and you know full well that you decided against full desktop backups when you signed on. Now, if you'd like to reconsider, we can get that going over night, and get the offsite replication done as quickly as possible. The sooner the better, but we need a fulfilled PO in order to do this. Do you want this done or not?""

Some very loud sounding screaming over the headset.

&gt;$Manager: ""$CCL, miss, as you've now resorted to raising your voice against me in such a way, I'll now be disconnecting this call. We will not go to your office during the storm and until you fill out the needed paperwork now, we will not be installing any backup software on your machines until every I is doted, and t is crossed. Have a good night.""

$Manager proceeds to hang up the phone call, and just looks at me with a half smile.

&gt;$Manager: ""No way in hell any of us are going out there, especially during the damn storm.""

Petti-The-Yeti,I need a temporary computer installed in office 123 so I can copy patient files in peace!,"My employer, ""Hospital A"", bought out a small local clinic, ""Hospital B"".

One of our least technically proficient customers calls in asking for a computer to be set up in a private office so she can copy Hospital B's patient files into the Hospital A patient system.

I'm hoping some of you here can relate when I mention ""Nightmare Users""; those users who put in tickets for the most insane, incomprehensible reasons, that no technician wants to pick up their ticket? Those users who set off every red flag imaginable, which tells you to question every word they say? 

That is this customer. 

She tells me that she wants a computer in a private office, because it's too noisy to concentrate on copying things over when she's at her normal desk near a busy nurse's station. I ask for more details, and she gets huffy and insists that I just come over and install her computer like she's so reasonably requested.

I get a brainstorm going with a few others in my shop to discuss the merits of her request, and we collectively decide (after input from our manager, who had walked in out of boredom with a conference call) that it's an out of the ordinary, but probably legitimate need, and we prep a laptop to put in her private office.

In the end, another of our techs went to deliver the laptop to her, and in the process, he asked her to show him what she was doing. 

She would open up a patient file from a USB stick that Hospital B supplied to her, wait for the file to load, clicked File, Save, and opened a different directory for the file destination, and saved the file there.

The USB stick had some 8000+ records on it. 

She had been working like this for a week straight, 8 hours a day, and had reached the G's.

My coworker did a CTRL-A, CTRL-C, CTRL-V, put the laptop we prepped back into it's bag, and walked out the door.


**EDIT**

A note on the USB flash drive, since I'm getting notifications talking about HIPAA violation stuff:

The USB drive was, in fact, encrypted. From my understanding, it was set up to unlock only on one of our domain devices, with a domain user account, using a certificate that we acquired from Hospital B along with the drive. 

I should have made that clear in the OP. My fault. ",talesfromtechsupport,699,1504788093
injinius,Beethoven.exe,"Hello TFTS, First post, hopefully this can brighten up your day a bit with how challenged our support is.
I work for a large company which recently took over a contract for over 10k+ users.

This was probably one of the most strange requests I have ever had while on the Desk.

&gt;$Me: Hello Welcome to $Company Service Desk, My name is $Me, How can i help you?

&gt;$User: Hi $Me, We got a new computer deployed to our site and we need Beethoven installed.

&gt;$Me: Beethoven? Like the composer?

&gt;$User: Yeah, exactly!

&gt;$Me: What exactly does it do?

&gt;$User: Oh we play it on the computer.

&gt;$Me: You mean one of his songs? (Proceed to check SCCM to see if we have any package called Beethoven for god knows what reason)

&gt;$User: Yeah, we use it to stop the screens from locking up.

I then proceed to completely understand why the user does this, apparently they have a local login so they can run a monitoring program and for reasons beyond my comprehension they've been using Beethoven to stop the screen from locking. For over 5 years. Instead of requesting a group policy change.

&gt;$Me: Okay give me a moment I'll write up a ticket and follow up with you.

&gt;$User: No problem. Thank you!

Proceed to Google. ""Beethoven stop locking screen"". (Yes I actually searched this)
I then come to the realization that Windows XP came with Beethoven's 9th Symphony. And the users would play this in Windows Media Player and mute and minimize it so it would stop the screen from locking.
This was beyond me at this point. I questioned in my mind why didn't they just use Group Policy to disable this. Found out it was rejected due to Security concerns with it being in a local area where anyone can access the PC and that lockout was part of standard policy.

I then try to hunt down a XP machine (god forbid we still have a few in circulation) in Active Directory and UNC to the machine, RIP off the song and copy it to the Users C Drive.

Give the user a call.

&gt;$Me: Hi $User, I've found Beethoven for you.

&gt;$User: Oh wonderful! Where is it?

&gt;$Me: I've put it on your C Drive. (Users here actually know where the C drive is)

&gt;$User: Awesome, just let me open it now.... *pause...* *hear Beethoven's 9th Symphony blasting through the tiny PC speaker*

&gt;$Me: Is that all you needed?

&gt;$User: Yes this is perfect, thank you!

roflcopter-pilot,Ticket closed. Reason: Can't teleport mass storage media.,"Sometimes you just gotta wonder why a person's train of thought derails, and how it comes they aren't even aware of it.


&amp;nbsp;


A staff member from marketing is at a conference today, where she'll hold a presentation. Nicely following protocol she had opened a ticket several days ago to request a loaner laptop for the trip, which was prepared and given to her in time. 

The conference is 700 km away, so she had to leave by plane yesterday evening. But right before she left, she opened another ticket - about an hour after our IT team leaves the office and only one of us is available over the phone for emergency purposes, via the on-call number.


When I arrived in the office this morning, one of my team members met me, a very confused look on his face, saying he's afraid he'll have to escalate a ticket to me. He was in complete disbelief about was was requested and wasn't sure how to handle it. ""Sure, escalate it over to me, I'll take care of it"", I said, and by the time I finished logging in the ticket already was in my queue. It stated the following:


&gt; Please put the attached files on a USB stick, they contain my presentation media for tomorrow's conference. The files are very important for this event, so please make sure there are no errors in copying.  


Two minutes later she had added a note to the ticket:
&gt; Be aware I won't be in the office tomorrow.


&amp;nbsp;


Wait, what?  
*blank stare into the distance*  
How can you...  
WHAT?


&amp;nbsp;


Alright, there's only one sane solution to this.

I fetched a USB stick and copied her files to it, wrote...
&gt;Attached files were transfered to a USB stick as you requested. Delivery of said media in time is unfortunately impossible due to a lack of USB mass storage teleportation capabilities.

... into the solution box and hit [Submit]. Ticket closed.


&amp;nbsp;




Really looking forward to the inevitable backfire!



&amp;nbsp;

**UPDATE**, because so many assumed I didn't want to help her:  
Unfortunately there was absolutely nothing we could do for her once she was on her way. She has no corporate phone, so we can't call her and she can't read mail unless she uses the loaner laptop to log into Citrix... but once she does this, she has access to her files anyway.

Meanwhile she has figured out that she needed to log into Citrix. According to logs she was online recently.


&amp;nbsp;

**UPDATE 2:** Just talked to her. She admitted that she really wasn't thinking straight at all before leaving the office that evening. Once she was on the flight and let her mind wander back to the presentation files it dawned on her that her USB stick plan was *slightly* flawed and panicked briefly. Soon she remembered that she can just use the laptop to get the files via Citrix, which she then did the next day, before her presentation at the conference. She did scold me about the ticket resolution though... a) because why can't we teleport stuff, we really need to find a solution for this, and b) because she had to stiffle a laugh when she read it and failed, so people looked funny at her.",talesfromtechsupport,4864,1504685087
SkyGuy182,I’m not giving you my cell number to be your personal 24/7 tech help.,"I recently started working at a realtors office. There’s a central staff of a few people, myself included, and real estate agents are basically our “customers.” One of my hats is “Tech Coordinator” for the agents where I just set up personal websites for them when they join and install our printer drivers to their laptops. However because I’m young, and showed someone a cool trick on Windows once, I’ve started to become de facto tech support. Normally I wouldn’t mind because I like helping people, however my main job keeps me busy enough as it is, so I have just had to learn to tell people “no” and direct them to Google or one of the local computer stores for big issues. 

Normally the “support tickets” I got revolved around setting up different email functions and setting up Facebook pages for realtor groups (The average agent is a middle-aged woman that still acts like computers and cell phones are new inventions) However the straw that broke the camel’s back and made me start nipping this at the bud was this agent coming in looking for printing help last week.

She’s in her 70s and is a sweet woman, God love her. She wanted to know how to make a scanned document look better when it’s printed because when she tried it just looked super faded, and she needed to take it somewhere to get signed. I just bumped up the print quality in the printer settings and voila. I explained to her that scans, especially as poor of quality as that one was, don’t translate to a printed page very well because it’s like making a copy of a copy of a copy. She seemed to understand and was pleased enough with the page I printed. I then went to go help someone with the TV in the conference room.

As soon as I came back out she was waiting for me and wanted to know if she could have my phone number and email in case she had any other issues. Sure, I didn’t have a problem with her calling my work email and number (which in retrospect would have been a mistake too). But as I went to write it down she said “Oh no I’d really like to have your cell number in case I have a problem when you’re not here.” Ummm. 

Me: “I’m not really comfortable giving out my cell number, especially for calls after hours. But like I said, if you have a problem with something feel free to call my work number!” 

Her (confused): “Well what if I need something and you’re at home and I can’t get a hold of you?” 

Me (struggling to find a nice way to say “hell no”): “I’m really not comfortable with being contacted after hours for work-related issues, but here is my work number you can call when I’m here, 9-5.” 

Her (almost desperate at this point): “Well what if I promise to just text instead? I promise I won’t call! Besides, you know real estate agents don’t have work schedules!” 

Me: “Like I said I’m not comfortable with it, and I work for [realtors office] which *does* have a schedule.” 

She eventually went away.

So yeah, after that encounter I’m taking measures to make sure people know I’m not tech support, just the guy that sets up your printer. ",talesfromtechsupport,2143,1504606051

This happened a VERY long time ago - back when floppy disks were still floppy.  My father (henceforth ""IT-Dad"") was working as a student employee at the Computer Center at his college. One of the services that the Computer Center provided to the campus departments was PC support. 

One day, an administrative assistant (henceforth ""Admin"") from the History department called with a complaint about her computer:

When she brings it by the next morning, IT-Dad examines the 5.25"" floppy disk and it looks in good physical shape (it's even in a dust sleeve), and it's a reputable brand. IT-Dad places the disk in a computer and tries to read the directory - the computer returns an error that the disk is unreadable.

&gt;**Admin:** ""See!!!  The computer lost all my files that I saved last night!""  
&gt;**IT-Dad:** ""It looks like the disk hasn't been formatted. Let me format it for you, the you can try using it tomorrow and bring it back again if you still have problems.""  

The next morning, the Admin calls and says she saved her files the previous night using the disk that IT-Dad had given her, but the computer can't find them again.

*--- Repeat scene from the previous day... including the Disk Unreadable error ---*

&gt;**IT-Dad:** ""Is this the exact same disk that we formatted for you yesterday?""  
&gt;**Admin:** ""Yes, I'm sure it's the same disk - I have a special place that I keep my current disk so I don't lose it. I even check last night to ensure the computer saved the files on it - I just don't understand why the computer keeps losing my files overnight!""  
&gt;**IT-Dad:** ""When you get ready to save your files tonight, give me a call and I'll come over and take a look at your computer. I'll bring one of my disks that I know works to test your computer, too.""  

That evening, the Admin calls IT-Dad and asks him to come over the History department. He watches carefully as the Admin saves her files to the floppy disk and uses the DIR command to ensure the files are there. He double checks the directory, runs chkdsk and even reads the disk that he brought with him to ensure the drive is working correctly - everything looks good.

&gt;**IT-Dad:** *(very puzzled)* ""Well, everything seems to be working ok, but you say that this only happens in the morning, and it's the same disk you used the previous evening?""  
&gt;**Admin:** ""Yup, and I know because I keep it right here on the filing cabinet so I don't lose it.""  
&gt;**IT-Dad:** ""Oh, yeah?  Can you show me?""  
&gt;**IT-Dad** *watches as the Admin puts the floppy disk in a dust jacket sleeve, then pulls a magnet off the side of the filing cabinet and uses it to stick the disk to the side of the filing cabinet.*  
&gt;**Admin:** ""This way I make sure that I don't ever lose my current disk!""

joyous_occlusion,Long lost voicemail,"Yesterday was the last day for a veteran user who was with the company since it started. She retired with a healthy pension, a generous buy-out from the company that took us over, and much respect from those in the IT department.

Her last request before she left: ""Oh, and by the way, I never figured out how to get at my old voicemails. Do you think you could help get it for me?""

Seeing as how she didn't work for the company anymore and her phone was being repurposed for the next user, our term of support was to end with getting the old system and data from the old company onto her personal computer. I saw no issue with having her voicemail inbox forwarded to an email, and she was one of those users you loved to help, so naturally, I said ""No problem.""

I logged into the phone system and had the voicemail emailed to her as a WAV file. I sent a follow up email letting her know about it and to call if she needed any help.

Today she called me crying, thanking me for what I've done over and over again. I didn't see what the big deal was, so I said, ""Please, that's why I'm here.""

""No, no, NOO! You don't understand, let me show you. I'm going to send it to you and I want you to hear it.""

It was a seven second clip of a feeble male voice saying ""Hello, darling. Just called to say I love you. Have a good day. Goodbye.""

It was a voicemail her late husband left her just before he passed away from cancer in the hospital eight years ago.

All I could muster was, ""Well, I'm glad I was able to get that for you."" I hastened the call along, said goodbye, and went into the bathroom and fucking bawled for ten minutes. I'm still welling up as I type this.

And this, folks, is what makes all the ass chewings, dealing with the noobs, the bureaucracy, and the asininity, and the neverending work hours a little bit easier to take.

DrupalOps,UPDATE The Beginner's Guide To Driving Your Developers Away,"ShortFuse spent yesterday winding himself up. 

He told BoyGenius several times the meeting was mandatory (bear in mind the meeting was only announced 2 days ago) and he had to be there. BG basically nodded but didn't say anything one way or another. BG left at 3. SF went off like a pinwheel at the meeting and told JuniorDev he was now lead. Everyone looked really uncomfortable. This morning SF came in at 9, which he never does, and told BG to clean out his desk, which is funny, because all he has is his MacBook; SF said he needed it back, but BG pointed out that he owns it. SF said he needed it so he could ""remove all proprietary code,"" BG said all your stuff is on GitHub, you're not getting my laptop. JD shows up, and SF tries to enlist him. JD quits. Standoff. BG stands up to leave, and SF tries to prevent him from leaving. BG is a lot bigger and heavier than SF, and just motors past him. JD follows. 

SF is bent, and starts yelling at me to find some more techs. I can't help myself, and tell him it's not going to be easy, and we'll really need 2 people to replace BG. SF seems to think I can fill in for BG, as I set up an early version of our project, but I haven't really touched a line of code in several years. I can BS in PHP, but I'm out date with anything JS related. Plus, we're in the midst of moving our main project to Drupal 8, which I don't know much about. 

There are several custom modules and I don't know shit about Twig or Symphony. AND we're revising the AWS stack and moving the SQL to encrypted RDS. Things heating up again - the Sys Admin. wants to talk - stay tuned! Sys Admin #2 out the door!

Even better, Big Client #1 just called and there is a big hole in the 2016 data in his last report, the one he paid $XX,000.00 for. He's unhappy. I don't think there is anyone left who can sort it out any time soon. I give him SF's cell number. Email from another Big Client, who needs a bespoke report ASAP. I vaguely know how these are done, it involves some Python wizardry on the raw data before we suck it into the system.

Keith_Fu,Issue Resolved. Phone was on the floor.,"Not me but my coworker had this ticket report:

""This morning I was summoned in the Conference Room 1 for a technical emergency, citing being late for their meeting as they were having trouble getting their conference call started.  I showed up and saw that the TV, keyboard and mouse were all turned off, so I powered everything thing back on and suggested that they should be all set now.  They responded that it wasn’t a GoToMeeting.  Confused, I asked how I could help, and they said that they needed a phone.

I quickly surmised that they had set up the conference room table by filling it with all their samples, and made room for them by taking the phone off the table and putting it on the floor.  They didn’t unhook it, so it was still functional, they just decided to move it from the table to the ground.  I picked it up from the ground and put it on the table.  They took over from there and started dialing.""

Neechoo,Unicorns do exist.,"Some time ago, I got possibly the best bug report ticket ever filed.

A piece of software I'd written would completely crap out under extremely
specific circumstances, upon encountering web pages written in a way I thought
completely insane. What I naively didn't realize is that, due to the
extraordinary leniency of web browsers in parsing invalid HTML, a lot of web
pages are written in a *completely* insane way.

So, one user happened to run the software on one of these little HTML
monstrosities, and it broke. An average user, if they would even consider such
extreme measures as *reporting* a bug, would write something like:

    Expected behavior: It works
    Actual behavior: It doesn't
    Reproduction steps: Visit a website

I've seen way too many tickets like this. This user wasn't an ""average"" user
though. This guy was a *unicorn*.

The bug report included **a link to a tiny page hosted on a VPS of his that would cause the bug to occur**. He had
enough knowledge and did enough testing on his own to *write a minimal example*
that still triggered it.

I still have that ticket printed out and pinned to the wall right above my
desk.

Skirrak,No solicitation on our grounds,"I was told from another sub I should post this story here.  Had to modify some stuff to fit with the rules.  I hope it fits in /r/talesfromtechsupport as I feel it is kind of in a weird grey area as far as some of the posting rules.

I own a small IT business and am often in our last big electronics retailer Greatest Bargain for various reasons.  I've learned the hard way over the years to not wear blue and to tuck my lanyard into my shirt to avoid confusion.

I've learned that people hate buying tech as much as they hate learning it so we offer a hourly billed service where we go shopping for them. Often times with price matching we can actually save them more money than we bill to do the shopping. One of my oldest well-to-do clients likes to replace his technology every 3 years whether it needs it or not.  I've tried to tell him this is unnecessary but he doesn't care.

He also likes to touch and see everything he is paying for before he gets it so roughly every 3 years I meet him here and show him everything, answer all his questions, and then he buys it and I set it up for him the next day.  

We spend about an hour and a half in the store I show him all his options.  He settles on his purchase and we load it all on the cart.  He then informs me that he would like to buy his wife a new PC and she is on her way over to the store but she will be 15 minutes.  I let him know it isn't a big deal, I have e-mails to respond to and I'll just wait here with the cart.  He mentions something about TV's and wanders off to the TV section.

Now I'm standing in the back deserted corner of the store with a fully loaded cart browsing my phone when an older lady walks up.  

Older lady: Excuse me, where can I buy time machine?

Me: Sorry, I don't work here I'm just helping a client buy a new computer. But do you mean time machine for Mac?

She holds up an external hard drive.

Older lady:  I'm sorry I saw you helping another person.  I asked a store employee about backing up my Mac and he (she gestures vaguely to another section) said I had to use this and time machine to do backups. 

I notice what she is holding is a mac formatted external hard drive.  I also know from experience that she can buy any hard drive and PC formatted drives are typically cheaper.   I explain all of this to her while also explaining that time machine is a free built-in backup tool on all Mac computers and how to access it.

Older lady: Oh my thank you so much, do you have a business card?

I hand her one out of my wallet after explaining the kind of work we do and go back to browsing my phone.

My customer comes back with his wife, they decide just to get two of everything minus a printer which they will share and we head to the front counter to pay.

Half way there an employee runs up to us visibly annoyed.

Cranky manager:  Did you just give one of my customers a business card?

Me:  Yes, but only after she asked.

Cranky manager:  One of my employees heard you speaking to her. There is NO solicitation on our grounds, especially not DIRECT competitors.  How would you like it if I stood in the store you work at and told customers about Nerd Posse?

I consider letting him know that would probably just help my business as he is being very rude and condescending, but I'm with customers.

Me: We don't sell parts or computers but I understand, I won't hand out cards here.

The manager gets a smug look on his face.  This is when my customer speaks up.

My customer:  Do you price match?

Cranky manager is obviously confused at the change the conversation is taking.

Cranky manager: What?

My customer:  Do you still price match ~~your online competitors~~ FreshEgg and Nile?

Cranky manager:  Yes, we will price match major online competitors like FreshEgg and Nile as long as the model numbers match up and they are not third party listings.

My customer:  Skirrak do ~~they~~ FreshEgg and Nile have these models?

Me:  Yes.

My customer: This ""solicitor"" just helped us pick out this entire cart.

At this point my customer pushes the cart loaded with a good 5-6 thousand dollars of equipment towards the manager.

My customer: We won’t be needing these.  Skirrak just order this stuff and have it shipped two day air, call me when it’s here.

I wish I had a sweet zinger ready but all I could do was laugh, the manager tried to get in a couple of words but my customer and his wife just walked away.  

And to top it all off the lady that I gave my business card to has also become a regular customer. 

TL;DR: Polite older lady mistakes me for employee at Greatest Bargain while I'm helping a client shop for new computers. I help older lady and she asks for a business card.  Rude and cranky store manager accuses me of trying to steal business from Nerd Posse (their in house tech support).   My client then takes his $5 thousand + purchase to another company because of how rude the manager was.  Older lady that took my business card also ends up becoming a regular client.

Edit - 

Wow thanks for the gold.

There seems to be some confusion about the exchange between my customer and the manager about price matching.  We were on our way to the checkout line to buy the entire cart when the manager intercepted us.  My customer knew that I was going to price match the entire cart at checkout like I always do.  He is a pretty funny guy, probably knew it would be a nice way to get the manager all excited about the cart full of goods and also at the same time verify with me if the online competitors have what he wants in stock.  In the original exchange he asks about the companies by name so I omitted them for posting rules.  I'll add some fake names to make it more clear.",talesfromtechsupport,2889,1504023154
aenomy,Should have just hung up,"Not so long ago, I managed the call center for my ""corp"".... Most days were long and grueling, dealing from complex issues to very simple ones. Once in a while, one of my technicians would field an interesting call from a certain individual.

$ThatGuy - Caller who knows it all, but actually doesn't  

$Tech - The technician that answered  

$OldDog - Me  


*phone rings*

&gt;$Tech - ""You've reached ""Corp"", this is $Tech, how can I assist you?""  

&gt;$ThatGuy - ""I've got this issue, my email won't work""  

&gt;$Tech - ""Copy that sir, I will submit a trouble ticket and get someone out there as soon as possible""  

&gt;$ThatGuy - ""That's no good, I need access to email now!""  

&gt;$Tech - ""Sir, I can't do anything about that, but I can see when we can get someone over there""  

&gt;$ThatGuy - *grumbles*  

&gt;$Tech - ""Please hold while I check on that""  

-----------------  

&gt;$Tech - ""Hey $OldDog, I have $ThatGuy on the phone, his email doesn't work, should I see when someone can get out there?""  

&gt;$OldDog - ""Sure, if it gets $ThatGuy off our back, the less we have to deal with him the better""  

*$Tech calls the backshop to get someone out there while he opens a trouble ticket*  

-----------------  

&gt;$Tech - ""Sorry for making you wait, there is a technicaian enroute right now, should be there in a couple of minutes""  

&gt;$ThatGuy - ""Ok, I am going to keep you on the line until he gets there""  

&gt;$Tech - ""No problem there""  

&gt;$ThatGuy (thinking he put the call on hold, actually put it on speaker phone while talking to a co-worker of his) - ""Those assholes over at ""corp"" can't do anything right, shit never works - F'ing idiots, I could do their job for them, F'ing dumbasses always breaking the network, I swear they are doing this to get me fired, I could do their job for them.........""  

&gt;$Tech - ""Sir... Sir... SIR!!!!! MR $THATGUY!!!!! YOUR PHONE IS ON SPEAKER AND I CAN HEAR EVERYTHING!""  

&gt;$ThatGuy - ""Uhhh"" *click* (He hangs up)  

------------------  

Turns out, $ThatGuy's network cable had been unplugged from the wall, which explains his email issue. We ended up reporting the call because it wasn't the first time $ThatGuy had called and abused my team, especially $Tech, who seemed to catch the brunt of his calls. $ThatGuy denied making the call, we pulled the call log and he fessed up to it. He is now no longer allowed to call the Call Center directly and has to have his supervisor make the calls for him.  


Also not the only speaker phone mishap I've dealt with....... Will post that one sometime later.

OneEyeball,"""Every time you go away on vacation our TV stops working.""","#Greentexted dialogue and bolded introductions for readability.

I would like to share what I overheard yesterday at my girlfriends home. No, it's not your usual workplace tech support story, it's short and sweet, but I think it definitely belongs in this sub.

People:

**$me**

**$gf = Oneeyeball's girlfriend and daughter of $landlord.**

**$landlord = My girlfriends mother, who is also the landlord**

**$husband = Husband of landlord. Also my girlfriends father.**

**$renter = The lady living renting the downstairs suite from $landlord**

Story time:

So, $gf and her family are doing their last bit of packing before they leave on vacation the following day, when $renter knocks at the front door, $husband goes to answer. I can overhear the conversation that goes something like this:
~~~~
&gt;$renter: ""I just wanted to make sure of something before you all leave for your trip tomorrow. Every time you go on vacation, I notice my TV (cable box) and internet stops working, and I've just now started to notice this pattern..""

&gt;$husband yells for $landlord to come downstairs, in his thick Indian accent I hear him mention something about unplugging the ISP modem.

&gt;$me to $gf: ""What the hell is he talking about?""

&gt;$gf: ""Every time we go on vacation, my mom unplugs the router, and all the TV boxes to save power.""

&gt;$me: I take a few seconds to contain my laughter, but I just can't hold it in and I &gt;burst out laughing. I run downstairs to explain that in order for $renter's TV box to &gt;work, they need access to the ISP via the modem she unplugged.

Poor $renter, it only took her 7 years to notice the pattern.

stairs80,Power Over Ethernet is not powerful enough...,"3 PM. GF is in class... I don't have my coffee. GF has been asking for a tale that I said I would write earlier, so here a story for all!

So I work for $EpicCompany which does all forms of tech stuff from Server Hosting to Tech-Support for the general public. One of the assignments I'm on is serving as a Senior Support Agent for another $HugeBusiness we are contracted to. I won't bore you with more details but there are some users who despite having high education, have obviously missed the class on common sense.

Now there are some users which are pretty pleasant ($Grandma), but then there are users whose sole purpose is to ruin your day. Sadly this tale is about one of them. Imagine an old professor who has 2 PhDs and hates being told he is wrong. He was here as a director of some research project that is (gladly) not in my department and definitely above my pay grade to give 2 shits about. Let's call him $SmartAss.

$SmartAss hates waiting, as he feels he is self-entitled to anything and his time is too valuable to waste. One day I had the misfortune to be manning the desk when he walked in. 

&gt;#stairs80: Hi! Welcome to the help desk! What seems to be the problem today?

&gt;$SmartAss: You guys broke my laptop.

He has one of older $workplacelaptops. Given that, I wouldn't be surprised if something did give at this point. They were nearing the end of our support contract and soon they would all be collected to be sent back to the company or be used as replacement laptops. So I got my diagnostics USB and tried running the tool... and no surprise it didn't boot. 

I plugged it in (with the older models I wouldn't be surprised if a battery gave up) and it booted away happily. With that sorted, I gave him a fully charged replacement battery and he was off on his way. I thought that would be the last of this and I closed the ticket... but just like the weather forecast hotline, I was off by a mile.

The evening rolls around and just as I am about to tag out...

&gt; #SmartAss: You guys are incompetent. I demand to speak to your manager.

Yep, he returned.

&gt;$stairs80: I'm sorry but my manager is away today in a meeting. Can I help you though?

&gt;$SmartAss: Yeah. The battery still dies even if I keep it plugged in all day.

Hmm... charger failers are less likely... I decided it would be about fair time I pay a visit to $SmartAss's desk to see for myself.

At his desk, with half empty coffee cups everywhere  (I think this is why there are no more glass mugs at our break stations...) he takes out his laptop and plugs in the cable for the USB dock and an ethernet cable. 

&gt;$SmartAss: You see? I plugged everything in and nothing is working! It's all your fault!

&gt;$stairs80: You plugged in an ethernet cable and a USB dock cable. Where is the power cable?

&gt;$SmartASs: Oh that? I threw it out.

W h a t    t h e    f u c k. Welp, I now can safely dock something off his paycheck. Making a mental note to write this onto this ticket, I wanted to find out the reason why I would be expecting one less chager to be returned to inventory. 

&gt;$stairs80: So why did you throw the power out?

&gt;$SmartAss: I read online...

(OH GOD... most of my problem comes from those horrid words)

&gt;$SmartAss: that there is something called Power Over Ethernet. I found out my DeskPhone was powered by that so I thought it would be nice to use that to power my laptop!

Jesus, that was surprisingly smart, yet absolutely stupid at the same time...

&gt;$stairs80: Sir, not everything can be powered by POE. 

&gt;$SmartAss: WELL IT""S NOT MY FAULT THAT YOU GUYS NAME SHIT SO CONFUSINGLY. YOU ARE OFFENDING ME OF MY OLD AGE AREN'T YOU. LEAVE YOU IDIOT. I AM TALKING TO YOUR MANAGER.

Frankly, I knew I didn't do anything wrong, so I just retreated to my desk and resumed Reddit browsing. I soon saw on the intranet that he was setting into a well-deserved retirement... though I never did figure out if he paid for that disposed of charger...

TL:DR: Power over ethernet cannot power laptops.

Happy now my beloved wifey?

chhopsky,ChhopskyTech™: How I accidentally ended up on the film crew of a documentary,"It's been a while since I've posted here, and mostly because being out of the consulting game means that straight up less weird shit happens to me.

Note that I say ""less"", and not ""zero"".  Weird shit definitely still happens, as documented below.

After working at Twitch for a while I moved on to other silicon valley jobs and now reside at a certain gaming company, but [my shred of experience with video](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2pcvyu/chhopskytech_congratulations_youre_now_a_film/) turned into a passion for live video.  I became an esports broadcast producer for Razer, and combined with the Twitch experience and the 'building shit out of nothing' has lead to me [coming up with and documenting a lot of the solutions](http://chhopsky.tv) I've come up with.

When Pokemon:GO came out I wrote a handy guide for streaming mobile games, and how to stream from a phone, or use a phone as a webcam.  People hit this site and the articles all the time looking for technical support on their streams, and for the most part I try to help them.  There are some good questions (mostly), some bad ones (occasionally) and some fucking stupid ones (thank god, rare).  But I have the knowledge and they need it, so I do it.

~\*time passes\*~

One day this comment arrives asking about some of the tech, and the email address is matt.*@bbc.co.uk.  What?  Like the British Broadcasting Corporation?  So I emailed the guy and we talked.  And he's making a documentary on Twitch and streaming.  But he's only ever been a viewer before, and is going 0-100 on going full time streamer.  And has no idea how to do it.
Eventually I ask why.  Why put yourself through all this?

He wanted to give back.  After suffering some personal tragedies and basically withdrawing from life for a while (now that I can relate to) Twitch had helped him find an outlet for communication in his darkest days, and wanted to give back by showing people this world that had been so kind to him.

What sounded like a cool project before, now had a whole mess of feelings attached to it, and Matt wanted to share something special with the world.  And the director had given him 30 days (thirty frickin' days? ARE YOU KIDDING ME) to make partner. But you know me - never say no to a challenge.

So I double down on it and spend some time taking him through it all.  Turns out all that experience in broadcast production on TV rigs has almost nothing in common with what we do, so we have to start from scratch.  We go through camera set up, pulling mic sounds, RTMP relays, mobile streaming, overlays, stingers, chat bots, voice techniques, software audio routing.  Ingest points, delay compensation, source synchronization.  Discord.

Realizing quickly that this was so much more complex than he'd ever imagined, he offered me the role of Technical Advisor on the documentary.

We got him to Affiliate in 5 days, and anecdotally, if you can get to ~100 subs as an affiliate you can start to be considered for partnership.  Short of a miracle, it's reasonably unlikely that he will get to the 100 or partnership, but it doesn't matter.  We took on a project, worked towards it, and for someone to go full time into something like this with to share part of our world with the rest of the world .. that's worthy of respect.  If nothing else, we know that even the professional TV world doesn't know the things that we know about this brave new world of broadcasting.

Anyway, that's how I ended up as part of the crew of a BBC documentary.

My life is weird.

drwookie,I have new respect for dogs,"You've seen it - the dog's complete inability to understand the concept of [rope](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tylerkellen/6244809952). I've just realized that many users are about as smart as dogs when it comes to computers, as shown through email. BTW, no control over this listserv, just front-row seats.

08:43 Email goes to to reserve a room - to a listserv anyone who may reserve a campus room. It's unclear how many faculty and staff are on this list, but there are many, many, many people.

08:46 Prof P replies to the entire list (and to help of course) asking to be removed. The leash is getting shorter.

08:47 Prof P replies to the reply that he sent to the entire list to be removed. The leash is getting shorter.

8:56 An administrative assistant (AA) from a very small department. She tells him politely that it looks like many people are on this list, and that he can take himself off it by emailing the listserve, and sends directions. A new object to get tangled around appears.

08:56 - 9:16 many, many different replies appear saying ""me too"". Other dogs are joining in on the fun.

09:02 - 9:16 Multiple replies go out explaining that people should quit replying. More replies appear.

09:12 Prof P asks the AA to take him off the listserv. She's firmly entangled now. 

09:20 AA replies to Prof P that she's just an office admin, and doesn't control the list, but he can contact the listserv peple. She includes the email and a list of people who want their names removed. The leash is tight and she's beginning to loose feeling in her legs.

09:27 Prof P thanks her for the information, and requests that she add him to the list of people to be removed.

09:27  I create an email delete rule based on the subject line.

techmnine,When in doubt...Invent??,"Being a sales assistant in one of the biggest shops in Malta I have to find the answer to any question the clients have. If you have ever worked in a tech shop you know people ask too many questions on some of the most basic of things. Examples - 

""Where does the plug of the mouse go?""
""Can I use an adapter from micro usb to HDMI so I can use Kodi?""
""Can I fix this IDE hard drive?""

Anyone working in the shop should be able to answer such a question but one of my colleagues had a very large tendancy to invent the most bombastic of answers. Misinforming the client led him to ending up in a lot of trouble.

Once an old man came in to buy a pair of power-line adapters for his home although he didn't know it yet as he only presented us with a problem. My colleague went to talk to him about what he needed and I didn't think much of it at first until I began to listen to the comments of the client saying things like ""How can that be?"" and ""This technology can't be real"" in Maltese. I was very astonished and volunteered to do a cash sale for the client so I could get the opportunity to talk to him before he left. Conversation went as follows -

$Me - ""Quite the astonishing technology we have nowadays to get better WIFI coverage""

$Client - ""It's like witchcraft, I don't know how they get to communicate like that""

$Me - ""What do you mean? They communicate through the power-line instead of having you use a more traditional UTP cable""

$Client - ""Wait what? Your colleague told me they use a series of echo waves similar to that used by dolphins to communicate between one another""

My superior steps in as he seemed to have been listening to the whole conversation. He apologized on behalf of the company and the client left mostly disappointed as he felt lied to. My colleague ended up in a lot of trouble for that. He ended up being fired weeks later for similar offenses. I guess his calling wasn't in the shop but rather some more creative job for that very inventive mind of his.

TLDR - Colleague told clients that power-line modules communicated via dolphin echo waves which he had invented. Got caught and later fired.

Alfakyn38,What do you mean you tipp-ex'd it ?,"Hello tfts ! Here’s a little story a coworker of mine told me the other day. 


Context : at the time of this story, about 10 years ago, my coworker was working for a huge banking firm and one of her tasks was to compile some data into a report, the data coming from a few different excel files from different employees/departments. It was mostly numbers : account balances, transactions and so on. The numbers she got after compiling the excel files she received had to match thoses from accounting. 


Now a new girl arrived at the firm, and was responsible for sending one of those Excels to my coworker. My coworker will be **$CW**, the new employee will be **$NE**. 
Immediatly after $NE’s arrival, my coworker noticed that the numbers she got were off : nothing matched anything anymore, and it was one could say a complete mess. Now her report was a really important document she had to send to some higher ups weekly, so she had to find the problem fast.


Suspecting the problem had to come from this new employee, my coworker investigated her excel file, comparing the numbers from $NE’s Excel to the source file (I don’t know how she got her hands on this). Now here was the problem : the numbers looked the same, but when she tried to compare sums from the two files, they were different.


*WTF*, right ? Same numbers but different sums ? 


She got to the end of this by calling $NE. The discussion went as follow : 


**$CW** : Hey $NE, the numbers from your excel file are off and I can’t find why, any idea what could have happened ?    
**$NE** : I don’t see what’s wrong, I just used the last excel file that was sent and corrected the numbers that had changed.    
**$CW** : Wait what ? You didn’t make a new one ?    
**$NE** : Well no, that would be too much trouble, I just tipp-ex’d the numbers that were wrong and added the new ones.    
**$CW** : … Tipp-ex’d ? What do you mean?    
**$NE** : That wasn’t clear ? I just erased them, like with a [tipp-ex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipp-Ex) on paper.


And that ladies and gentlemen, was how my coworker discovered that for some people, turning some characters’ font white meant erasing them.

EDIT : formatting
",talesfromtechsupport,1584,1503057717
unclerube,Please refer to my initial email.,"This happened several weeks ago and, although the initial problem is considered trivial by many, it turned into a big issue. 

Cast of characters:
$Me = Your's truly. Need i say more?
$OU = Ornery User.
$OM = Ornery Office Manager
$OS = Overseas User.

Day One

I arrive at work and sit down to go over my emails as the first part of my daily ritual. This ritual includes reading through all of my new emails and making a list prioritizing the most important to address first, leaving the menial or trivial for after I have completed those. I am sure I am not the only one. Little did I know, however, was that one of those emails that I considered menial and trivial turned into an almost week-long email chain that included managers, VPs and other flavors of executives. 

This email read as follows:
&gt; Hello $Me. Emails from $OS have been going into my Junk Email folder for about a week and I didn't notice. Can you please make it so they don't?

Day Two

Now, to be fair, I did relegate this to the bottom of my to do list which culminated in my not addressing the issue at all on day one. On day two, $OU sends me another email as a reminder. Since I had ignored the issue the previous day, in my mind, that raises the issue's priority. 

I reply to $OU's email as follows:
&gt; Hello $OU. Please check your junk email settings and rules to be sure that you didn't inadvertently add $OS' name or email to the list. 

In the email, I include instructions and screenshots on how to perform those actions. 

$OU replies in addition to CC'ing $OM:
&gt; I don't have a Home tab. 

In that email, $OU includes a screenshot of their email app. At the top left, there was the Home tab. I open the screenshot in Paint, draw a red arrow pointing to the Home tab and send it back with the following:

&gt; I marked the location of the Home tab with a red arrow. Please refer to my initial email on verifying your junk email and rule settings. 

I didn't hear back that day. 

Day Three

$OU sends me an email, with more people added to the CC field, that read as follows:
&gt; Please advise if you can help.

What? 

I reply to all with the following:
&gt; $OU, did you follow the instructions to check your junk email and rule settings as I had asked in my initial email. I have added the instructions and screenshots below.

I copy-pasted the instructions and the screenshots from my first email and sent it off. 

$OU replies to all and writes the following:
&gt; There was no rule so I added one to put $OS into my inbox?

What?

My reply, to all:
&gt; $OU, Did you look in your junk email settings? Above the Rules button, click on Junk and then click on Junk Email Preferences. Select the Blocked Senders tab and see if $OS' name or email address is on that list.

Her reply, to all:
&gt; I tried that and it just froze my email app. I re-launched it and it states that it created the rule. I will let you know tomorrow if it resolves the issue. 

WHAT? You didn't answer my question. Fine, I'll deal with it tomorrow. Thankfully, those copied on the email had not become involved yet. 

Day Four

There it is. An email from $OU sitting in my inbox. Maybe I should send her to my junk email folder? 

By now, there are six people copied in the email and it read as follows:
&gt; Hi team. This is still happening. This needs to get resolved. $OS is my main counterpoint overseas and cannot have her emails going to SPAM!

There was more, but I don't have the stomach to write it all out. In addition, there was an email from $OM chastising me for not fixing the issue quickly enough; of course with everyone copied. 

Very well. Had I known this would have turned into this nightmare,  I would have taken more drastic measures. Measures that I will exercise now. 

I log in to the Exchange web portal and perform a message trace on the most recent emails from $OS. I look at the details of the latest email and and the status read as follows:
&gt;The message was delivered to the recipient's mailbox. Because of an Inbox rule the recipient set up, the message was delivered to the following folder:
&gt; Folder: Junk Email

Snip, copy, paste into a reply-to-all email. 

I open my command line interface. Connect to the exchange server and look up $OU mailbox settings. Lo and behold, $OS is in the blocked senders list. 

Snip, copy, paste into fore-mentioned reply-to-all email. 

I wrote the following:
&gt; $OU, see the screenshots below. I logged into our server and found that you indeed have $OS in your blocked senders list. Please follow the instructions in my initial email in order to modify the list. 

Her reply to all:
&gt; Yes, they should not be blocked. 

WHAT? REALLY? That sentence doesn't even make sense. First of all, why answer with a yes. I didn't ask you a question. Second, based on our long email chain, we have already established that $OS should not be in your blocked senders list. Finally, who on god's green earth, is THEY?

I log back into the exchange server using the command line interface. I pull up $OU junk email settings and clear the list. 

My reply to all:
&gt; $OU, I have cleared your junk email settings. Emails from $OS should no longer go into your Junk Email folder. However, this means that you will need to re-add any email addresses that were originally in your blocked senders list that you do want blocked. As stated, you can reference my initial email for instructions on how to do that. 

$OU replies to all:
&gt; Thank you. 

YES! Finally. I can put this to bed. I dutifully work on other issues for the rest of the day. By day's end, I am relieved that I had not received another email from $OU. 

Day Five

Email from $OU replying to all:
&gt; $ME, there are dozens of emails in my inbox that I had marked as spam. Why are they not going to my junk email folder?

I'm done. 

I click reply to all and hammer the following on my keyboard:
&gt; You're kidding me, right? Have you read any of my emails? 

It was a spur of the moment thing and I allowed my emotions to get the better of me. I should have been more professional. I spent the rest of the day expecting an email from $OU, or anybody really. However, it has been over three weeks and I haven't heard anything else. Nonetheless, I hadn't been able to get this out of my head so I decided to share with you guys in the hopes it will be cathartic. 

Thank you for reading. And please, don't bang your heads on your desks. It can cause concussions and lead to brain damage. ",talesfromtechsupport,742,1502998027
holdstheenemy,The worst co-worker I've ever had. - Part 3 FINAL,"Part [One](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6tut4t/the_worst_coworker_ive_ever_had_part_one/) and [Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6u1yi3/the_worst_coworker_ive_ever_had_part_two/)

It's interesting how many of you have had someone just like this guy to work around. I'm glad you got away from the guy if you did and if not, chin up, I feel for you, it's not easy working around people like this.

$director = former “IT director” turned incompetent unstable tech

It’s about a day or 2 later and $director shows up at his regularly scheduled time. As you can tell, he still has his job, for now I guess.

Couple coworkers and I are standing in our “sort of” breakroom, basically just a room with a table and some chairs, coffee maker, shelves, old parts and what not. In that room we have inboxes on a shelf where people send us inner-office mail or invoices etc. So we’re standing there getting coffee just shooting the breeze, and in walks $director who doesn’t look at us and starts shifting through his box. You could cut the tension with a knife:

&gt;$director: Good morning all 

&gt;$coworker: good morning

It got really awkwardly silent at this point but $director just walked to his office. One of my coworkers is in charge of handling the assignment of help desk tickets, if it’s T1 or higher etc. he’ll assign it appropriately. This morning he had a t1 ticket to assign to $director because our boss told him to start assigning him more work. My coworker tells us this:

&gt;$coworker: I assigned him a ticket this morning, I hope he doesn’t get all flustered over it.
 
&gt;$me: What’s the ticket about?

&gt;$coworker: It’s over a printer fix in the administration building

&gt;$me: crap, it’s not that big copier/printer is it?

&gt;$coworker: I’m not really sure, why?

&gt;$me: that machine frustrates the hell out of him, well to be honest all tech seems to frustrate him, but this one more so.
 
&gt;$coworker: oh well boss told me to assign him more work and so I did

&gt;$me: alright, hope it goes down ok...

$coworker walks back to his area and I go to my office and start sifting through emails answering calls etc. when out of nowhere I hear voices getting louder and louder….

&gt;$coworker: It’s a simple ticket for a printer, did you even look at it?

&gt;$director: no and I can’t right now I got a lot of work to do!

&gt;$coworker: well the boss-man told me to assign you tickets so I did

&gt;$director: I can’t be fixing that printer right now, YOU need to look at it if YOU think it needs to be fixed!

&gt;$coworker: you know what $director, just never mind okay? I’ll take the damn ticket. 

I hear stomping around and I peek outside my door, $director has his coat and bag and yells F*CK IT! as he slams the door behind him and leaves. We don’t see him for the rest of the day

I walk into my coworker’s area:

&gt;$me: wtf is that guy’s problem! Are you alright? What happened?

&gt;$coworker: Idk man I saw him assign that ticket back to me and he wrote “I’m busy” under the notes. So I assigned it back to him and said “boss wants you to do it” then he just came in here flipping out on me and yeah that’s when he left. 

&gt;$me: the hell is wrong with that guy seriously

&gt;$coworker: man the boss just needs to fire this dude. I’m just… done with him

The boss later comes in and hears it all. He tells us to write down everything that happened while he gets HR so we can tell them what went on. 

They hear us out and when he returns the next day, $director is put on administrative leave for a week. 

The very next week, $director shows up. As I’m driving up to the building I see him getting out of his car with his shoulder bag and a coffee in his hand. I think to myself 

&gt;“ugh he’s back, I’m just going to wait until he gets into the building before I get out of my car.”

I slip into my office and start getting to work on my PC, some time passes when out of nowhere I see $netadmin rush past my office. 

“Wtf?” I think to myself as I look out my office door and walk over to $netadmins office

&gt;$me: you look like you’re in a rush, everything alright? Can I help?

&gt;$netadmin: no time, boss and $director had another “group therapy meeting” and it didn’t go very well, I’m disabling $director’s credentials throughout our network

&gt;$me: WHAT?? So is he getting canned? Please tell me they’re firing him, tell me!

&gt;$netadmin: I think so, I’m not sure though, HR had security escort him to a conference room and boss told me to get on this now, so if you don’t mind

&gt;$me: oh right, sorry, let me know if you hear anything though, seriously

I walk back into my office and start IM’ing some coworkers asking if they heard anything. They get just as excited/nervous as I am but they haven’t heard anything either.

A little time later my boss walks into my office:

&gt;$boss: heads up, we are letting $director go so just to let you know, also he is NOT happy about it
 
&gt;$me:  is he really unstable or something? Should we be nervous?

&gt;$boss: he is in a room with a couple security guards as HR is giving him an exit interview, I just wanted to let you guys know though 

&gt;$me: exit interview?? They should just boot the guy out the door!

&gt;$boss: I know, I know, but HR feels that the best course is to not piss this guy off even further so they’re trying to do it as peaceful as possible. He agreed to a lay-off so we’re processing that ASAP

&gt;$me: He doesn’t deserve that although it’s damn good news to hear he’ll be gone, but hey, you okay? What happened in there with you two?

&gt;$boss: I’m fine, just an argument, but I have to go grab some stuff I’ll talk to you guys later

We later found out that $director had to have another work evaluation as part of his return from forced leave, it didn’t go well. In that meeting my boss set some “goals” for him and tried to work things out. $director didn’t like that at all and started swearing and getting aggressive saying things like 

&gt;“YOU DON’T LIKE ME!” 

and

 &gt;“YOU FAVOR THE OTHER GUYS OVER ME!” 

and of course

&gt; “I COULD WORK ANYWHERE I WANT AND MAKE 3 TIMES AS MUCH!” 

All of us in this department have actually heard that last one several times in the past.

Anyway, after my boss told me they were letting him go, I was kind of nervous that this guy could go postal or something so I took a very long lunch until I got word he was escorted out of the building and gone for good. None of us have seen him since.
 
We also heard that he had been having regular meetings with HR and it was there he told them he had been suffering from several mental issues ranging from PTSD to BPD. He wasn’t taking medication for it apparently, but I hope he’s getting the help he needs now. 

And that was probably the worst nerve-wracking experience I’ve ever had with a co-worker. After this was all over the guys and I went out for a few beers after work and talked about this whole ordeal and tried to laugh at it

&gt;$me: Hey $netadmin, remember that time he tried to plug his “start-up business” into the all-staff email?

&gt;$netadmin: oh yeah that shit was hilarious, the CEO shut that down so fast, who the hell does that?

&gt;$coworker: how about that time he called in vendors to check our server after it gave a remote access error

&gt;$me: ah yes I remember that, we paid that vendor 2 grand to check server quality on a server that was being prepared to be replaced

&gt;$netadmin: yeah I just took that down before he called that in, He had the vendors put it back in the rack and check it, god what an idiot.

&gt;$me: who the hell signed off on that?

&gt;$netadmin: the boss did, I guess he believed $director’s BS at the time, he never made that mistake again

&gt;$coworker: ahh and how about the time he got assigned to run back-ups for one of our servers at &lt;another site&gt;

&gt;$netadmin: oh you mean when he was just backing up that office computer in the server room and nothing else for months?

&gt;$me: you HAVE to tell me that one!

&gt;$netadmin: not before another round. *Barkeep!*

The office has been very stable and calm ever since, well other than the occasional hectic occurrences that usually happen in IT. 
 
A little while ago I got wind that $director was working in retail as a “Merchandising Associate” which I think basically means a stock person. Which store you might ask? A store I will probably never step foot in…

Firemanz,"""I have fiber but would like info about your Ethernet service"". ""Sir, you have ethernet""....","So I am the Head of IT for a multi-site company. I am also a college grad with a networking major, so I know a thing or two about basic internet services, but that doesn't mean a thing when talking to my ISP. 

Today, a store manager at one of our sites called me and said his internet was slow, so I remoted in and started running some speed tests. All of them came back as 10mbps/3mbps. But hold on a sec! The owner has been bragging about the ""blazing fast dedicated fiber"" we have at that location since I got hired. Surely he doesn't think THIS is fast!

 So naturally I asked the office manager to see our bill only to find out we are paying $355 a month for this slow service (in my area, there is a reliable company that offers 200/100 dedicated fiber for $200 a month).

Since it's my job to streamline our technology, I figured I would call the ISP (a local company) to ask about other internet plans. After all, this location has no need for dedicated fiber. Little did I know I would get some prodigy of a customer service rep that would share her wisdom of the internet with me.

&gt;$CS: Thanks for calling XYZ how can I help you?

&gt;$Me: Hi. I'm with YZX. According to our bill we are paying $360 a month for 10/3 fiber, which is pretty bad. I want to see if we can just get a residential Ethernet/DSL service here since y'all advertise those packages at 125mbps for 70 dollars per month. 

&gt;$CS: You have ethernet.

&gt;$Me: umm..No we don't. We have fiber. I want to change us over to a VDSL or Ethernet service.

&gt;$CS: You already have ethernet, sir.

&gt;$CS: I'm looking at the converter box right now. We most definitely have fiber.

&gt;$CS: I can assure you, you have ethernet.

&gt;$Me: umm..ok... Either way, these speeds are not worth the price. Can I just see what plans you offer in my area so I can pick one better suited for my company?

&gt;$CS: Can I get your account number?

She pulls up my account and there is silence while the gears turn. Certainly she is reading that we pay for dedicated fiber.

&gt;$CS: Sir, it says here you pay for our 10/3 dedicated fiber connection, which comes inside your building and terminates into an Ethernet connection that goes to your computers, so I don't see what the issue is here. You have ethernet. 

&gt;$Me: *facepalming so furiously she could probably hear the slapping*

&gt;Me: You have a package listed plainly on your website that says ""metro Ethernet: Packages from 5mbps to 1gbps"". I am interested in seeing what 125mbps would cost, because it is listed here as 70 dollars. 

$CS: I'm sorry sir, but as I said earlier, you already have what you are asking for. *5 second pause* I do not see your name on the account. I cannot discuss this any further.

*Click*


So my lesson of the day is that apparently because the fiber line into the office terminates into Ethernet, that means I have Ethernet service. Silly me.

maximumtesticle,"""Don't you dare try to chastise me via email!""","We recently had company wide training and part of that was reminding people, especially attorneys, not to share their password.  However, the place I work at has always looked the other way in regards to secretaries knowing their attorney's password, because ""Sometimes I need to log into their computer to check their email!""  Well, yeah, that's a problem, for reasons I don't need to list because more folks reading this have some common damn sense.

Anyway, I emailed an attorney and asked her to call me so I could get her password so I could configure a new computer for her (after we configure it, we have them change it).  She replied to my email, with her password and CC'd her secretary.

I thanked her, but asked her that in the future, please don't email the password because it's against our company policy.  Now, this user...oh boy, she is a princess.  But more like, you know when Miss Piggy dresses up as a princess?  It's like that.  Her father is a judge and she has gotten through life because of him, well for the most part because he damn well isn't because she's a courteous person.

So she replies, ""I am on vacation!"" (she didn't have her out of office set, so I didn't know).  ""I am NOT calling you.  And do NOT try to chastise me via email!""

Her secretary then responded to the emails and explained that ""He wasn't trying to be mean, he was just explaining the policy, but don't worry, your password is safe with me!""

Pigerella then replied (thank god for reply all, am I right?), ""I don't care!  What an absurd email to send!""

Me- *Slams phone down*

After this incident I updated her ticket, fully expecting the printer guy to send her a link to a replacement guide.  I used her id number to find her office and check the printer while she was on lunch break because I was curious.  There was literally a door on the side of the printer with a bright orange label that said open to replace staple cartridge.",talesfromtechsupport,949,1502900071
holdstheenemy,The worst co-worker I've ever had. - Part Two,"Part One [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6tut4t/the_worst_coworker_ive_ever_had_part_one/)

So it’s been a week or so since our last fiasco. Things seem to be settling down and we haven’t heard much however, this is just the calm before the storm. 

$director = the former “IT director” now tech who simply cannot do his job competently

$me = me

$netadmin = network administrator 

We get a call one morning from &lt;another site&gt; saying that the internet has completely gone down. We ask if $director is there and of course he is not, this is around 8am. We try remoting into a few machines and we cannot reach them. This is followed by a call to the local ISP for that area and they report no outages. So once again, we make the long drive to that site. 

We get there a little after 10 and begin troubleshooting lines. What we found is that there was a power outage the night before and the battery backup for the modem coming into the building has completely fried. We get a tech from the ISP down here later on that day and he replaces it and internet is back up, crisis averted.
While we were trying to fix this, around 11am $director strolls in, looking like he just got there for the day and asks what’s wrong. We sort of fill him in and he has this look like

&gt; “I’ve got no clue what you’re talking about but I’m going to go ahead and act like it”

 You know sort of like the guy that repeats exactly what you said to make it sound like he knows

&gt;”fiber and battery backup, yeah yeah sounds about right”

We continue working on various tasks and check with users in the area, making sure they’re okay. 

$netadmin and I decide to go get lunch at this local café at about noon and then head back to the site around 1 or so. As we are driving back we notice $director’s car turning towards town, away from the site:

&gt;$me: isn’t that $director, where’s he going?

&gt;$netadmin: maybe he’s getting lunch too?

We never see him again that day. 

We get back to the site and start testing lines, looking at the server and it’s running just fine however, we notice that the battery backup is a small APS backup that would typically be used for a personal desktop computer, not for a rack of servers, we also notice that the “fault” light is blinking. 

&gt;$me: lot of good this is doing, check this out

&gt;$netadmin: you have got to be kidding me! I told him to get rid of this and change it out MONTHS ago! god-forbid I gotta babysit the guy into doing something right!

&gt;$me: well we better get a proper UPS in here, I’m surprised the servers didn’t get fried during that outage. 

So we leave the site and $netadmin heads back out the next day with a fresh APC UPS ready to be installed early that next morning. He installs it without a hitch and heads back to our main site. Once he gets back he comes into my office.

&gt;$netadmin: $director didn’t show up until about 11 and then disappeared after 2 probably. He came in asking what I was doing and I tried to explain it to him, he got a bit frustrated then disappeared, his car was still around, however when I left the site at about 2 or 3 his car was gone. 

&gt;$me: so let me get this straight, based on what we’ve seen, the guy comes in for 3-4 hours then leaves? How does he get away with this, doesn’t he have to clock-in or something?

&gt;$netadmin: when he started working here we set up a VPN for him so he could remote in from home so I’m guessing that’s what he does. 

&gt;$me: did you talk to the supervisor there? I wonder if they noticed him leaving, that’s just plain ridiculous

Later that day $netadmin went and had a chat with the boss about everything that went down. The next day $director comes in and starts saying hi to everyone etc. The boss asks him to go into his office. 

Apparently my boss had already contacted the supervisor out at the site and boss was told that he regularly would come in for about 4 hours and then just leave without telling anyone, without permission. After hearing what $netadmin told him we saw, this was confirmation enough. He was written up and told to show up at 9am everyday otherwise more action would be taken and he was also reminded to actually DO his job. 

The next day $director apparently shows up on time at &lt;another site&gt; and calls me at around 9am. One of the computers was giving him trouble, freezing etc. I gave him basic troubleshooting instructions and got off the phone. We had several issues arise at our main site so I was busy taking care of that. He would call me every so often about the same exact computer and it would go something like this:

&gt;$director: $user’s machine won’t even boot up anymore

&gt;$me: have you checked the power source? Did it get bumped? I can’t really tell you anything unless I’m there

&gt;$director: are any of you planning on coming out here soon?

&gt;$me: not too soon, hey maybe try googling it, I got stuff to do here

Apparently this wasn’t appropriate for him, as he hung up on me. I shrugged it off and went about my day. I get a call maybe an hour later

&gt;$me: hello this is $me, what can i…..

&gt;$director: listen, you and me, we got a f**king problem here! 

&gt;$me: excuse me? *recognizing the voice* look bud, i didn't do anything here

&gt;$director: I know you and $netadmin have been trying to get me fired, but you don’t need to give me some bs answer like “google it” you understand me!?

&gt;$me: what are you talking about, okay I'm going to hangup now

&gt;$director: I’ll be sure to talk to HR about this

&gt;$me: I hope you do

*click*

After this, somewhat shaken, I go to my boss and tell him what happens, he tells me to file a complaint with HR and lets me know that I can take the rest of the day off if I want. 

The next day he comes in and they again speak with him, he gets written up again and the “investigation” by HR continues. I try and keep calm throughout the day and he doesn’t try and bother me at all. 

The problems get worse as the week goes on and soon enough I hear word that HR is going to possibly take action, whether that means firing him or something else I don’t know, all we know is that he is very disgruntled.

quilladdiction,"""Is it Penny?""","Y'all have heard the term ""bad penny,"" right?

For those unaware, it's a term for a person (or thing, I guess, but usually a person) that just keeps coming back no matter what you do or how badly you do not want them to. That said, our cast of characters for today...

> $Quill - Me, helpdesk assistant, works (almost) all day Tuesdays. Minnesota nice. Well, trying my best to be.
> 
> $Manny - A helpdesk specialist/one of my supervisors, master of sounding like he knows what he's talking about on the rare occasion he actually doesn't.
> 
> $Stan - Fellow assistant, works mornings, very laid back.
> 
> $Dani - Fellow assistant, works afternoons. More conventionally polite than me no matter what she says otherwise, but with a shorter temper.

> $Penny - The user, student advisor. Blunt.

> Cameo by $Julius, the boss of helpdesk. He's awesome.

Scene set. It's 10 a.m., about 95 degrees outside, and I'm not having my best morning. I'm running late. No coffee. I haven't slept well since Saturday. I'm thinking far too much about a more-than-friend who recently downgraded to ""just friend,"" which apparently I'm less fine with than I thought. No amount of loud radio is helping (rare for me), and there's no damn coffee. On top of that, I roll into the lot with a headache that persists for the rest of the day, nearly touching ""migraine"" at one point, only to find a *huge* truckload of boxes parked right in front of the office.

The hope that that truck has nothing to do with me gets crushed the instant I walk through the door, in the single best case of ironic timing I've ever seen in reality:

> $Quill: \*opens door*
> 
> $Julius: \*talking to $Manny* ...well maybe when $Quill gets in she can help out...
> 
> $Quill: \*contemplates closing door, but my mouth is too fast and $Stan, already on the phone with $Penny, has already nodded to me* What am I doing?

Covering, as it turned out. That shipment of printers was not supposed to show up all at once, and it was hot outside. They needed to get in and get working ASAP. By the time I got there, $Julius had recruited specialists from about five other campuses to help us at Central dispatch, and we were still stretched thin. As a reward for not having to run around the campus lugging printers in and out, $Stan and I were running tickets and taking calls meant to be handled by five people at the time of year when IT is needed most and all the weirdest shit goes wrong, and his shift was over in an hour and a half.

Joy.

So we're doing our best. It could have been worse, to be honest. The tickets were all from a glitch the day before, long since resolved, and there were lots of calls, but not so many that I had no time to breathe between ""you're welcome, have a great day"" and ""IT helpdesk, how can I help you?"" I sincerely did not want to be there, but I've handled worse.

But then.

> $Stan: \*picks up phone, gives standard greeting, hangs up within a minute and mutters out loud with a smirk in his voice* Good, PIN reset, keep giving me those...

PIN resets are easy. I thought that's what he meant. A few minutes later...

> $Quill: \*picks up phone* IT helpdesk, this is $Quill, how can I help you?
> 
> $Penny: Yeah hi there, can you reset a student's PIN for me?
> 
> $Quill: Sure thing, what's their username?

I reset, tell her she's good to go, she thanks me and hangs up. But a few minutes later, she calls again, and I overhear $Stan repeating back the same username. Wait, what?

> $Quill: \*walks to $Stan's desk* Is that $Penny?
> 
> $Stan: \*nod*
> 
> $Quill: About [student]?
> 
> $Stan: \*nod*
> 
> $Quill: \*extreme ""huh?"" face* I *just* reset her!

This lady. 10:30 a.m., I'm groggy and achy and basically wrecked, I really had no patience for someone who would not even wait to test the PIN before hanging up and proceeding to call back to ask for another reset because ""it didn't work, it brought me to the same page.""

Which was a real shame, because I got her next. Well, after her number bounced to $Manny's direct line, then to $Martin, my other supervisor/specialist, then to $Julius, none of whom were in office. Trying to skip over the general dispatch line, as it were. Because surely they have *super* reset powers, being of a higher rank and all.

I say that sarcastically, but I can only guess that that was actually her train of thought, because that's all she asked. I was sure it was the cache, and still went through the whole ""research"" bit just to convince her *before* I reset. It was the cache. Restart browser, try again, reset, it works, ride off into the sunset. Or upstairs to the retirement potluck as soon as someone came back to take over for a bit. Some talented cooks in IT, I have to say, but there was still no damn coffee.

\*caffeine withdrawal/stress headache intensifies*

Cue afternoon. I was back for five minutes, ran back out for the Tylenol in my glovebox and came back with $Dani right behind me, which was a *huge* relief given $Stan had left already and the office re-emptied as soon as I got back on the phones. I busied myself with a couple of email issues, one for a student, one for a teacher, both a combination of phone calls and emails to way too many people. Specialists drift in and out and at one point congregate at $Manny's desk to mass-squint at the finicky print server when suddenly...

> $Dani: I-I'm sorry, just trying to help...

Dead silence.

Thing about $Dani is that for some reason she's a bad call magnet. A good 80% of irritable users hit her phone before anyone else's. She's got a thick skin, but I wasn't hearing ""I have to say this because customer service, in reality you're pissing me off."" I was hearing ""Jesus, you didn't have to cross *that* line, and I'm pissed but *am* trying to help, stop yelling at me."" Nasty customer.

I didn't realize until ""when you reset it before"" and ""same page"" came back that oh JFC...

> $Quill: \*marches over, looking at caller ID but asking anyway* Is that Penny?

It was. I could tell by $Dani's silent ""you know my pain!"" look. Different student, at least, but it sounded like the same issues. I got another call at that point so I couldn't listen in, but moments after I was done with mine, $Dani hung up with an exasperated sigh.

Evidently, $Penny had no clue how to use a part of the college system that was *integral to her job.* She didn't even know what it was. When troubleshooting a problem that turned out not to exist (because $Penny's ""same page"" was actually a different, similarly designed page that she did not read), $Dani had tried bringing her to the direct URL instead of going through the entire site to get there, and that's when she went off... because ""What is [site]!? I don't even know what that is!""

Student. Advisor. Didn't know about the thing that does registration, class selection, student records, personal information change, financial aid... basically everything important. We looked her up, just to check if she was new - nope. *Fifteen years* and she does not know what it is.

What.

It gets better, too. She apologized right after the tirade, insincerely so, but insisted it was because she didn't like $Dani's serene phone jockey tone. To which I just noted that it's a good thing she didn't get me, because I'm sarcastic as hell and my mouth is faster than my mute button. And the kicker? She complained that ""Danielle was so helpful last time!"" $Dani had to resist asking who she thought she was talking to. $Penny had only talked to one other woman today, and that was me. $Dani doesn't give her full first name anyway, and in reality her name and mine are about as similar as ""Danielle"" and ""Quill.""

She called back one more time before the day was out. Got $Dani, and she was beyond done. ""Serene phone jockey"" was gone and the bluntness not at all subtle. Clear the cache. No, not like that. That's a bad idea. So is that. By the end of the day we were both strangling invisible $Pennys.

TL;DR: Bad Penny keeps turning up, is somehow threatened by politeness and doesn't know how to do a job she's had for 15 years. Also, pls forgive grammar/spelling/general weirdness. I need sleep.

Edit: Clarity. I hope.",talesfromtechsupport,772,1502870889
thegur90,You can do THAT yet you can't even delete your own emails!!?,"LTLFTP+Hard to format on mobile.

Ok, so I am by no means an IT but the one who everyone in my family call when they need help.  
So I get a call from my grandpa (89 yrs old) about a new win 10 laptop he just got and he needs help setting it up.

Now keep in mind he is the kind of person to blame the machinery if he clicks on the wrong thing so I already knew this would not end in a phone call - so I drove to his place expecting to see it still in the box. That was not the case.

When I arrive, I see him already in his desktop, after he somehow managed to install windows correctly on his own accord - and waiting for me while playing minesweeper. As he greets me, he freaking ALT+F4's to close the game and then tells me he cannot connect to the internet.  
Not sure what happened in the week I wasn't there, I ask if he could show me the problem.

He then OPENS CMD AND PINGS HIS OWN CELLPHONE and then points at the 0 packets text to show me there is no connection.

At this point id probably look less surprised if I see an alien invasion.

So after showing him that you need to enter the password to connect to his home wifi, he then asks me how to see his email account again.  
Still completely stunned, I show him how to access his outlook account and how to delete some messages.

And the craziest part- when I asked him how did he know about CMD his answer was: ""I learned it from grandma"".

EDIT: I just asked granny about this whole thing and she does not remember. Unfortunately I will never know what supernatural being managed to teach them that.",talesfromtechsupport,10470,1502719075
