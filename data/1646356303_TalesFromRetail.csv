MattyDGames,Your know card doesn’t work? Let’s grab all the frozen meats and then leave!,"Ok ok, today I had a customer come in with a cart full of various items (99% of it was frozen meat). She asks me to scan up only one item and I ask, “is this a separate purchase?” She replied, “no I just need to see if my card works here, the store I went to before this had some issues with it”. Since I’ve done this for customers before it’s not all that different, I ring up the item and her card sure enough fails. She does get a bit annoyed because she said that she checked on the internet and found out that her card company was having issues with their servers and wasn’t transacting purchases or changes of any kind. She knew this before coming into the store. She said she was going to step aside and call the card company and asked me to hold the items. I go though a couple more customers and she didn’t come back. It took about 30 minutes for me to realize she just left because we were very, very busy and I was the only cashier on shift. The meat was out of the freezers for more than 45 minutes in total and we had to throw it out because at that point we could not sell it. Thanks random lady for making us have to throw out a good section of our freezer meats.",TalesFromRetail,854,1638923563
MissMissieFatCat,Woman proves herself wrong and storms out of store,"I work in a family owned pet food/supply store. We have this program that often has deals like ""buy one get one free"" for certain products, and when a deal is going on we'll put a little paper sign up by the product. 

A woman comes in and buys three things: a case of the most expensive cat treats we carry (the case was like $40 it's crazy) and two small bags of freeze dried meal mixer things. I ring her up and tell her her total and the woman gives me the ugliest look. 

""One of these is free"" she grabs one of the freeze dried meal mixer bags. 

Me: It didn't ring up as free... (Our system is is weird. Some of the time it's up to date with the program's deals and will automatically ring it up as such. Other times we need to enter the stuff into a completely different system to redeem the deals and rewards. It's a pain.) 

Customer, getting more aggressive and angry: The sign said it was buy one get one free.

I'm about to tell her that she may be right and I will go check the sign when my manager who was behind the counter with me speaks up.

Manager: That's for the kibble. You buy a bag of kibble and get one of the freeze dried bags free. 

Customer, in the nastiest tone i've heard from someone yet: That's not what the sign says. 

My manager gets up and she and the customer go to check the sign. It's quiet for a moment and then the woman comes storming from around the corner.

""***You know what, forget it***"" She's absolutely irate. She storms out the door without any of her stuff. My manager returns to the counter. Just like she said, the deal was 'buy a bag of kibble and get a bag of freeze dried meal mixers free.'

Nothing crazy, but one of the wildest and sort of funny experiences I've had. Sorry if this is confusing to read, i'm bad at words lol.",TalesFromRetail,756,1623770945
Knever,Coworkers try to steal $200 worth of groceries with this one neat trick!,"I worked at a grocery store with a guy who, one day, came in for his shift and opened the register at the far end of the store, with two out-of-service registers between him and the other working registers (imagine 8 registers/lanes, 1-5 are good, 6 and 7 out of order, and 8 also good). Had his friend shop for about $200 worth of groceries, check out at his lane, and he rang it all up as $0.99 (he rang it all up as one lemon, as it were).

The thing is, the friend he was helping also worked there. Also as a cashier.

The head honcho was in that day. His office oversees the whole store so he saw it immediately. Both idiots got fired right then and there (though the one guy who was buying the groceries took off before being confronted).

I had gotten along with the guy who did the cashiering, but the guy who tried to steal (I mean, technically they both did, but I'm talking about the guy who had the day off) always rubbed me the wrong way and I wasn't surprised when he did something so stupid.",TalesFromRetail,848,1623707257
Mr_jon3s,Moves parking cone gets mad that I yelled at him and complains.,"Having some work done on the parking lot so we cone off the area with signs and cones. As I am putting up more cones farther down I see a man with his family moving the cones to park in a space I just coned off. So I yell at the the Hey you can’t park there. Guy moves his car and goes shopping. 
Me and my buddy finish setting up / cleaning the space and are taking a break when this guy comes back from shopping walks up to us and starts saying that I shouldn’t have yelled at him and instead should have stopped what I was doing walk all the way across the parking lot and asked him nicely to more. I told him you see all the signs and cones why did you try to park there. He said because he was handicapped and I proceeded to point to the handicapped spots that were open and even saw his car parked at. He told me do you like your job and wanna keep it. I told him no I really don’t care. He ended up complaining to the head manager but luckily the manager didn’t care and said he shouldn’t have moved the cones and tried parking in the sectioned off area.",TalesFromRetail,602,1623594705
pessimist_kitty,Getting real tired of people thinking we're magicians.,"This just happened this morning and I had to share. I work in a tiny photo printing shop. Our hours are from 10am to 5pm. First thing we do in the morning is get the printer started which needs to warm up, and then we need to do a test print. We had three orders that were placed the evening before after we were closed, so they'll be printed right away. Probably 10-15 minutes at the most for small orders.

Right at 10:02am a lady walks in and says she is here to pick up an order. She gives me her name and I recognize it from one of the three orders that came in the night before. I said, ""Sorry, they're not ready yet, the printer is just warming up. They shouldn't take too long.""

She just said ""Well then I don't want them."" and stormed out. I was dumbfounded. I've been in the store for literally 7 minutes at this point. Sorry I can't make your prints appear out of thin air I guess?",TalesFromRetail,1227,1614891256
OkayMolasses,The funniest customer story I love retelling.,"This story comes from when I worked at a retail store. I guess we're not allowed to say what the store is. 

I was sitting at the welcome desk and this lady comes up all frustrated saying ""that machine isn't working!!!"" Not surprising. Everything's broken. 

I told her we could take a look at it. I walked over to the price checker with her and scanned an item. She had a small amount of stuff in her cart. 
I said something like ""it seems like it's working, that price looks right.""

And she goes ""well where's my receipt???""

I just stared at her like..what? Where's your...what??

I told her ""this isn't a self check out..it's a price checker."" And she threw her arms in the air and got all huffy and left cussing and ranting to herself. 

I definitely did not wait for her to fully leave before I died laughing and told my friends I worked with. Then put her cart in the put backs. I could have cashed you out lady. You had like 5 items. It would have taken 5 minutes. You didn't need to leave in a huff.

Also, WHATD YOU DO, SCAN YOU CASH!? Like...how did you think that thing worked???
I honestly think she just made a mistake and felt really embarrassed even though we could have just made light of it. But whatever. I couldn't even be upset by her getting all pissed. I thought the whole thing was just funny.",TalesFromRetail,806,1614821310
silverwolf478,Rude customer forced to apologize to me,"So this is a story from my first job ever. For some backstory, I worked at a department storefor three years and was working in the lawn and garden/tolls section of the store. Took me some time to get use to it and learning about the specs for the merchandise was a bit of a pain but I managed with the help from my coworkers and they are awesome (miss them like crazy since I left but I do contact them from time to time.)

Story time. I've been working there for a year and a half by the time and a pretty big snow storm was about to hit the next few days so we had a lot of people in the store wanting snow throwers, shovels etc. Outside the store chained up were some returned/used snow throwers at a lower price but they make us some decent commission, more if a protection plan was added. This guy comes in and since I wasn't with anyone at the moment, our cashier directed him to me for help. He comes up to me asking if I could help with a snow thrower outside and I said sure. Jerk, as to what I'll refer to him by now going forward, started out decent in the beginning and was somewhat impressed that I knew better ways to take care of the snow thrower (thank you V (not using his full name) those extra details helped a lot.)

Jerk said he needed to check something else in the store but told me he'd come back to me when he was finished for the sale. I said sure thing and placed a sold sign on it. About 15 minutes later he comes back and asks for me to finish the sale. I rung him up with no PP (protection plan) since, I gotten this a lot, ""his friend is a mechanic."" Didn't hurt my numbers much since I had sold a much more expensive model with a 3yr plan.

The sale is done and I go with him to unlock it for since it was chained and had a security tag on it (no clue how that helped but I didn't care much) him and he asks if I can get a wrench to loosen the bolts. We go inside and this is where he went from kind to a jerk.

Jerk: ""So what about it's horsepower? How much does it have?""

Me: ""Snow throwers don't go by HP they go by CC.""

Jerk: ""But do you know the conversion?""

Me: ""No not really.""

Jerk: ""So you don't know much else about the machine then? Just the basics and a bit more how to maintain it.""

Me, now knowing where this is going but trying to stay polite: ""Sorry but when it comes to more details like what you're asking me, I don't really know much else.""

This dude didn't go livid or anything like that, but was annoyed. He started insulting my knowledge, calling me an idiot and then said the company hired me because they were sorry for me. I normally am a very patient person, not wanting to argue unless I have to and I never been in an actual fight but I can hold my own if need be. Almost was in one though but that was before I worked there and that would be another story if I ever remember the details.

Also I was hired there cause my older brother worked for them also as a store manager, so there was reputation with our name at the store. Him being a store manager and me being one of the top sellers for my department. The manager who hired me didn't know we were brothers until he saw our last name and this was after he said I was hired.

Anyway, I was done with this guy and I told him also. I went back inside with him demanding the wrench to loosen the bolts but I told him no and tossed it back in to our tool box. He was annoyed and demanded a manager which the cashier called to get him to shut up and out of the store. Another coworker went with the wrench and loosened it for him. About 5 minutes later my managers came to the front of the store and asked Jerk what was wrong and he told them. However, my coworkers heard the insults and told the managers what he said. They called me over the PA system as I was away from the check-out and away from him. I went over and this is what I came back to:

M1: ""You need to apologize to my associate right now. How dare you insult him while he's been nothing but kind and patient to you. We don't take kindly to customers being rude to them""

Jerk: -somewhat half-assed- ""Sorry""

Me: ""Apology accepted.""

M2: ""Good, now you may leave. We are done dealing with you.""

The guy left shaking his head and I thought he was muttering to himself but I didn't care anymore. My managers came up to me and said to not worry about him and that it was a smart idea to get away from him incase the situation escalated. They know that I have a lot of patience but even I have my limits. We spoke for a few minutes so I can just get that jerk out of my mind and my floor manager, who is a nice Jamaican older woman and the one who mainly spoke to Jerk, said ""I hope that thing breaks while he's using it. He didn't buy a plan right?"" I shake my head and she said ""Good cause I don't want him here or the repair center at all.""

I had a smile on my face for the rest of the shift. That remains my favorite moment of my life to this day. I currently work in a supermarket since I didn't return to the sporting goods store cause of the pandemic and my manager there is pretty chill also and I told him the story and said that he'd do the same if that ever happened. I had a smug smile the whole time typing this out.

Edit: it was a 2 stage snowblower. For some reason I’ve just been calling them snow throwers despiste the subtle differences even a little before I left the company due to work becoming scarce. And with the horsepower part, the snowblower was about 160cc and even then I didn’t remember the conversion but it’s around 5hp.",TalesFromRetail,746,1614392107
Read_lots,Why don't customers (or their spouses) actually listen to what we say?,"To give a little background, I work in a small store that specializes in pet supplies. There are 3 locations that all sell the same items (more or less).


 One of the things we sell is birdseed. It comes in jugs or bags. The bag is more than double the volume of the jug, but less than $5 more in price. 


We received 8 jugs and 2 bags of birdseed today and my colleague called a customer who had requested we put a couple aside for her. He said he had to leave a voicemail, as the customer didn't answer her phone. About an hour after my colleague left for the day, I received a call from the customer's husband. The following is the conversation I had with him.


Me: We received our shipment today, and wanted to confirm that you wanted 4 jugs. Is that still the case? You'd save money by purchasing the bag, instead. 

Husband: Can we get 5 jugs? I didn't save my jug the last time - I recycled it. Can it be delivered tomorrow along with our food? 

Me: I can certainly do that, but are you sure that's what you want? If you buy 2 bags, you're saving money and have roughly the same amount of birdseed. I can send you whatever you'd like. The food is ready to go...

Husband: I don't have the jug anymore. What's the price difference?

Me (Explain all the math - price savings as well as product volume. Also state that I can send 2 bags tomorrow as that's what I have to sell him.)

Husband: Oh! I'll take 5 bags, then. 

Me: Sir, I'm sorry. I have 2 bags physically here in the store that I can sell you if you want them all tomorrow.  

Husband: OK! I'll take 3 bags then! That and the dog food. 

Me (mentally hitting my head on the counter): Sure. I'll send you 3 bags. Your total for the three bags and food comes to [whatever amount]. If you're all set, I'll charge the card on file and my driver will see you tomorrow some time. 

Husband: Oh, yes. The credit card. Do you have my wife's card?

Me: Yes. It's on file. I'll charge it later today and she will receive an email receipt. 

Husband: Wonderful! We'll see you tomorrow.

Me: Have a great day!


I called the location closest to the customer's address. Luckily they had a couple of bags come in, so they were able to supply the missing bag.

SomeSonance,30 Minutes of my time wasted : Customer has me help them only to complain and leave cart at store,"So I work at a craft store chain with several stores in the area. I'm a cashier, but since we have so many cashiers I often work on the floor when we aren't as busy. Thanks to C-19, we've been having slow incomes of stock pilled on top of customers buying more supplies than usual since they are stuck at home having to do crafts. To set today's scene, I was returning items to the shelves when I got stopped by an interesting customer. 

C : Customer

Me : Me

CK1 : Customer's Kid 1

CK2 : Customer's Kid 2

OSW : Other Store Worker

OSM : Other Store Manager 


C : Hello, do you have this style of yarn in stock? 
Me : Let me check! 

C shows me her phone and I find the item that's on our app. There's a skew there which I look up, and it shows that we are out. 

Me : I'm sorry, it looks like we are out of that yarn. 

C : Do you have any in overstock? 

Me : No, we do not, our list of stock details all stock, including overstock. 

C : *sigh* When will you be getting more?!


Now, I need to emphasize that processing is not my field of study in this job, as I am normally a cashier. But I do know that we get new shipments in on Mondays, but yarn has been coming in increasingly sparingly and we haven't gotten many new shipments in a while due to low supply. 


Me : Due to delays and low stock thanks to the pandemic, we are not able to tell when any new shipments of that yarn will arrive. 

C, beginning to look frusterated : Are you SURE there isn't any in overstock?!?

Me : I'm positive. We do not even have an overstock location set for this type of yarn, as we haven't had overstock for it yet. 

As we are having this beginning to be repetitive conversation, CK1 and CK2 arrive out of nowhere. CK1 asks her mother a question.

CK1 : Moooommm, I need to go to the bathroom. 

C : Have CK2 take you! 

CK2 : But I don't know where the bathroom is...

Keep in mind, these two children are young. The oldest, CK2, looks to be maybe 5 years old, while CK1 is about 3 years old or so. 

Me : The bathroom is right around this corner! *I point the direction*

C, shooing her kids off : Yeah, yeah, go. *switches back to me* Are there any other stores that may have the yarn?!

Me : ...I can check. Can you please give me a moment? *checks scan gun for other store availability* It looks like nearly every single store in the nearby vicinity is out as well. Though there is Random Town (RT) that's across the city which may have a few-

C : But that's so far!!! I don't want to drive out that far! 

At this point I'm trying to stay as silent as I can. I'm not very confrontational at all and tried to let the situation calm down as it could. C was beginning to look really infuriated from such a small thing, and I wasn't one to fuel the flames.

Me : I understand your frustrations, but I've checked every single store that could possibly be nearby and every single one is out of stock except for RT. 

C : Fiiiiine, but I'm going to call them to make sure they have it. 

I'll spare the most of the 10 minutes she had me help her set up a call with the other store. She insisted I stay and help her call, even when I had maNY other things I could do instead. During this time, her children had returned and were clearly desperate for their mother's attention, but C was physically shooing them off because this call was apparently more important. Eventually, C got on the phone with the other store after calling 3 times. 

C : Hello, can you check if you have this specific yarn in stock? I have the skew number here. 

OSW (Other Store Worker) : Sorry, we aren't able to do that since we are busy right now and don't have anyone avalible on the floor to check that. 

C : But I need to see if you have this yarn before I drive all the way out there! 

OSW : There isn't anyone avalible to check for you right now. 

C, now visibly frusterated : Can I speak to the manager?!

OSW : ...I'm gonna put you on hold.

C, once put on hold, addresses me : (Craft Store) has terrible customer service! 

At this point, I am baffled. C has now just addressed me, a customer service member of said craft store, complaining about the customer service of said craft store. In that moment, I had no clue how to respond and simply awkwardly nodded. What kind of response was I supposed to give?! I want nothing more than to get out of this. And, to be fair, I should of. But I was too awkward to ask to leave. So, for 5 agonizing minutes on hold, I sat with C and her energetic children begging for attention. Eventually though, the Other Store's Manager (OSM) picked up the call. 

OSM : Hello? 

C : Hi there. Can you check if you have this item in stock?

OSM : *checks* I'm sorry, we do not have any of that yarn in stock. 

C : But I'm at a different store and it says you do have it in stock! 

OSM : Sometimes the system incorrectly puts in the number in stock when mixing up returns. Our apologizes. 

C : Are you suRE?!

OSM : Yes, I'm sure. 

C hangs up and turns back to me. I'll spare the next 15 minutes, but I managed to negotiate and look at other yarn she may also need for her project and see if she can get that yarn first. It took many more gruelling minutes of shifting through every single isle of yarn we had, but I eventually helped her get a cart full of yarn for her project. As soon as we finished, I was called up to the register to assist with the line. It was extremly hard to hide the visible relief on my face. 

Though, this isn't the end of C's story. Luckily enough, even though we had 3 cashier's at the registers, I was (un)lucky enough to get C back at my register when she went up to pay. Her kids were still running around but C didn't even look in their direction. I was desperate never to see C's face again so I quickly rang her up. The trouble began near the end of the transaction. 

C : *shows me a coupon*

Me : I'm sorry, we no longer accept competitors coupons. 

C : Since when?!

Me : Since last March. There are several signs placed around the registers. (I point her towards one)

C : Do you have any other coupons? 

Me : We have a 20% off coupon on our website! 

C : Do you have anything better than that?!

Me : *explains all possible options we have for discounts at our store*

C : Can I just....can I...AuGH! *grabs her purse and kids* Can you put it on hold? 

Me : Uh...sure...wait-

Before I could stop her, C nearly ran out of the store with her kids in tow. I tried to stop her to let her know that I needed a name and phone number to put it on hold, but she was gone before I knew it. I was now sitting at my register with an entire cart full of yarn that I spent 30 minutes helping this lady find, only for her to run out the store and demand I put it on hold. 

TLDR; Customer has me sit with them for 30 minutes to make sure they find their yarn, complains about the customer service of our store to my face, only to leave their cart at the register for me to put on hold once they find out they can't use another store's coupon.",TalesFromRetail,839,1614267528

You would get 1 point per 2 bucks spent in the store (excluding alcohol and tobacco among other things) and one point would be worth something around a cent. 

I had this lady at my register, that bought a pack of candy or something like that. She insisted on me scanning her loyalty card - which I did. I was also fed up with this job and handed in my two weeks notice earlier that week. (aka started the best two weeks of my life)

Lady: Nice. How many points do I get then?

TXtoBOI,The customer was about to take off,"I (27M) worked at a local grocery store from 16-23 before graduating from university and was a well known employee by most all of our customers. I had maybe 4 negative encounters throughout my 7 year stint there, but because we were extremely customer oriented I would bend over backwards even for the worst of our patrons. Keeping my mouth shut for so long in a customer service job had finally caught up to me when I knew I was about to triple my income overnight. 

I had accepted a job and was going to be moving out of state in a week when this happened. I was off of work for the day, but my mother needed some groceries picked up and I decided to go get them for her. The parking lot of our store was on a slope and we often had issues of runaway carts hitting cars. It usually wasn’t a big deal and people would leave a note indicating what happened with their number. 

As I’m packing up the car with my bags I look over and see a kid riding the cart down the parking lot and I let out a chuckle (come on, everyone does it). My laugh immediately stopped when I noticed he was going full speed towards a pretty beaten down car that happened to belong to one of my coworkers. He hit it full force and left a sizable dent in the drivers side door. His mother appeared out of nowhere, looked around, and quickly took the cart to the area where we store them. 

I’m sitting in my car watching this happen thinking: “Please God leave a note. Please don’t make me say something.” Sure enough she gets back to her car and opens the drivers side door. 

Me: You are going to leave a note aren’t you?!

Lady: What?

Me: Your kid hit that car and left a mark. You need to do something about it. 

Lady: Mind your own business it’s not even noticeable and I don’t have paper or a pen to write my information down on!

Me: If you’re not going to say something then I am. 

At this point I lost it. Mainly because I only had a week left working there and because I realized I was at the store, but not wearing my work attire and had dreamed of a moment like this for years. 

Me: You’re good with teaching your kid it’s okay to damage someone’s property and not take responsibility for it?! What kind of person does that?! What kind of role model are you being? You need to go in the store and tell someone!

Lady: Leave me alone! I’m leaving. 

At this point I get out of my car and start walking towards hers. 

She gets in, rolls the window down, flips me the bird, yells “Fuck you!” and speeds off. 

I got a picture of her license plate and told our store manager and the employee what had happened. His insurance took care of it, but I wish she had to pay some kind of price. 

tl;dr - I wasn’t wearing my work uniform on a day off and saw a kid hit a car with a grocery cart whose mother let him get away with it and sped off after I yelled at her.",TalesFromRetail,758,1614124069
Icy_Jade_88,Lady attempted to spit on me,"TL:DR at the bottom
NOT a woman refusing to wear a mask story!

A few months ago, around end of November, beginning of December, a woman came into the girls clothing store I worked at. Now the store I worked at recently closed due to being bought out. A lot of people were mad about that, yelling at the employees and demanding explanation. I wasn’t a manager or anything, so I didn’t really know much, just what I was told. So all I knew was that any purchases made after November 12th were final sale, no returns or exchanges. The registers are also set up where we have signs saying all sales are final and we have plexiglass between the cashier and customer. 

This lady came into the store and she looked pretty put together and wealthy. She was wearing form fitting jeans, a sweater, and had nice makeup on. In my area we require masks or face shields, so she had a face shield on(it comes into play later). She also had 2 girls with her, probably 9 and 5. Both of the girls were also nicely dressed.

She walked around for a bit before finally choosing a set of PJs. She walked up to my register and paid for her things, with me telling her 2 times verbally that all sales were final. We tell them all sales are final before they pay and again when we mark their receipt final sale. She acknowledged me, paid, and went to walk out of the store. On her way out she stopped and looked at the PJs again. She seemed to find another set she liked, so she walked back up to the register. 

I took her at my register, assuming she wanted to buy the other set, but she slammed the bag of purchased PJs and the other set on the counter and said “I want to exchange these.” I looked at her and said, “I’m sorry ma’am, but all sales are final so I’m unable to do that.” She didn’t like that answer and started saying “I didn’t even leave the store, I was just bought these, do it.” I explained to her again that I’m unable to do that, we didn’t even have the option on the register anymore. She got more and more visibly aggravated with me. 

She kept demanding that I exchange the items, using so many different excuses like “I just bought them, they are the same price, I didn’t even leave, you didn’t tell me it’s final sale, etc.” Keep in mind, there are signs all over the store saying final sale AND I told her 2 times. I kept telling her over and over that I couldn’t exchange them, but would be happy to ring it up in a separate purchase for her. She wasn’t having it. She eventually slid her face shield up and spit in my direction. The spit landed on the plexiglass and not on me, but at that point I wasn’t taking it anymore. 

I’m not sure if she knew the plexiglass was there or not, but either way I was done. I called my manager over and calmly explained the situation to her before stepping back. Now, my manager is very mama-bear type. If someone messes with her employees she doesn’t take it. She took one look at the customer and said, “you have 5 seconds to leave the store or I’m calling security to come in here and drag you out.” 

The customer was taken aback for a bit, but eventually grabbed the PJs she purchased and stormed out. Her daughters just looked scared and embarrassed of their mom the whole time. 

The store closed shortly after that, so I’m not sure if anything ever came of it, but let’s just say I’m glad I don’t work retail anymore. 

TL:DR I told a woman I couldn’t exchange her purchase and she tried to spit on my face before my manager forced her to leave.",TalesFromRetail,1042,1612389715
Stucumber,Someone has never been told 'no' before.,"This is an old one but it's stuck in my mind as an example of the over-privilege some people have. Hopefully I haven't embellished it too much in the subsequent years of retelling. On mobile, apologies for any formatting errors.

I'm working, as an assistant manager, in a shop in the weeks following Christmas one year. We have a display of boxed chocolates and other sweet gifts. There's an older lady perusing this selection as I'm tidying shelves, checking stock levels etc, when I hear a loud, very posh voice.

""Excuse me, you there!""

""Can I help Madame?""

""Yes, I'm looking for a box of chocolates.""

""Anything in particular?""

""Well, just something to replace these.""

She had with her, in her hand, a box of chocolates that we sold, that much I could see. I mentioned that I'd be happy to help her find a replacement. I knew these weren't exclusive to us and could be found elsewhere locally, so I asked if she had her receipt.

""Oh no,"" she replied haughtily ""I didn't BUY them, they were a gift! My grandchildren told me THEY bought them here.""

""Oh okay, that shouldn't be a problem."" Were a small town, and I would normally recognise the customer, but we have a few well off, older people that rarely visit the local shops and I thought I'd give her the benefit of the doubt, she was a bit superior but I was determined to be professional and polite.

""May I just ask, what's the problem with the chocolates you are returning?"" I asked

""Oh there's nothing WRONG with them, I just don't like them!"" 

It was at this point I became a little suspicious.

""I'm sorry, could I just see which ones they are?"" I said

It was at this point, when she held the box out, I could see that they had been opened, the seal broken and the inner packaging loose.

""I'm sorry Madame"" I told her ""this box has been opened, I can't accept a return if the product isn't faulty ""

""Well of COURSE it's open, I had to try them, that's how I know I don't like them.""

""But there's nothing actually wrong with them? They're not mouldy or contaminated?""

""No, I just don't LIKE them!"" Her condescending tone was starting to get to me.

""I'm sorry Madame, I won't be able to accept these for return as the product was in good condition when we sold them and they've been opened since.""

""This is ATROCIOUS, how am I supposed to know if I like something if I can't open it!? I will NOT be shopping here again!"" with that she stormed out.

This might have carried some weight if she had actually ever deigned to shop here in the first place.  The audacity to ask for a replacement for a food product, that had been in perfectly good condition, until she had partially eaten it and that she hadn't paid for in the first place! True to her word, we never saw her again.",TalesFromRetail,1279,1612260477
Background-Option-93,Why does the birdhouse cost more than the treat?,"So a while ago I was working in a big chain store for pet supplies.  
A part of our stock was seasonal products, many of them for wild birds.

I was working the register on an average day, engaging the the occasional conversation with the customers, when an old lady comes to the register.  
I ring her up and tell her the total, and she pays with nothing out of order happening.  
She leaves, but comes back about 2 minutes later.  
I ask her if there was a problem, thinking maybe I had accidentally rung something twice or given her the wrong change, despite always being very careful.

In the following exchange, L is the Lady, M is the manager

Me: ""Is there something else that you need?""  
L:     ""Well, you have typed in the wrong price.""  
Me: ""Wrong price? Our prices are in the system, but I will have a look.""  
L:     ""See, this bird house is 19.99.""  
Me: ""Yes, that's the right price.""

The ladys features darkened instantly.

L:     ""No, you typed it wring. The price tag says it's 0.99.""  
Me: "" Oh, I don't think that's right. Can you show me the tag?""  
L:     ""Are you saying I am a liar?"" This is a scam! You are trying to rob me!""  
Me: ""No, not at all. But maybe you looked at the wrong tag? A birdhouse can't be 0.99. Can you please   
show me where you got it?""  
L:    ""This is fraud. You can't do this to me!""  
Me:  ""Please calm down, I will look at the tag.""  
M:   ""Hello, is there a problem?""  
L:    ""This boy is trying to rob me!""  
Me: ""The lady says the price tag for this says 0.99. I asked her to show it to me.""  
M:    \*confused look\* ""Alright, let's have a look then.""

The lady now finally shows us where she got the item.  
It was a big basket, with several items displayed next to each other and the pricetags for each one in the front.

L:    ""See! It says 0.99!"" \*pointing to the small treats RIGHT NEXT to a bunch of similar birdhouses\*  
Me: ""No, this is for the treats. I'm sorry for the confusion, mam, but it is clearly labled.

The tags had the product names on them.

L:    ""No, it was not laying with these! It was on top of these snacks, so this tag is the valid one!""  
M:   ""Well, some customer may have put it down there because it's easier than to fit it back in. But this   
is clearly not the correct tag. A birdhouse can not-""  
L:    ""I WANT MY MONEY BACK! I WILL CALL THE POLICE RIGHT NOW!""  
M:    ""Of course we can take the house back, but we can't sell it for 0.99.""

She went on screaming and the manager gestured me to go back inside.  
A few moments later they went inside, and the lady smugly held out the item.  
I did the return, gave her back her money and suppressed the urge to roll my eyes.

L:   ""That will teach you. And I will NEVER come to this store again.""

She said in a victorious tone.

I couldn't help but grin widely at that.

Me: ""Oh I see! Have a great rest of your life then!""

She huffed, and puffed, and the manager and I shared a good laugh afterwards.",TalesFromRetail,909,1612173910
jordwn,Fellow cashier catches her alcoholic step dad trying to buy alcohol while drunk,"So for context, I work in a state that doesn’t allow you to sell alcohol if you’re under 21. This story happened about a year ago. I was working an evening shift and this very clearly intoxicated man comes to my register with a case of beer. I could smell him from the end of my conveyer belt. He gets to the front and asks for cigarettes, so I direct him to the only register that can sell cigarettes. The cashier on that register is under 21 also so I notify a manager that the cashier will need assistance soon for an alcohol sale. I also mention that the man is clearly intoxicated and, therefore, cannot purchase the alcohol (not sure if it’s the law or just store policy). He finally gets to the front of the line again and the cashier rings up everything but the alcohol. The manager goes to the register and informs the man that he cannot buy the alcohol because he’s clearly intoxicated. He argues that he walked there and should be allowed to purchase it because he isn’t driving. This confuses my manager and leads to 2 or 3 higher up managers coming to the front to try to sort it out. This is when I hear the cashier behind me screaming something I can’t remember exactly but it was something along the lines of “that’s my step dad, he’s an alcoholic” and “I’m calling my mom.” The cashier runs over and begins yelling in her step dad’s face while calling her mom. When her mom answers, the cashier tells her what’s going on and the mom starts yelling at him too. Long story short, he didn’t get his alcohol but he might’ve gotten a divorce. Not the craziest story, but definitely an eventful scenario to watch unfold.",TalesFromRetail,786,1605496910
oofjellyfish,Man tells me our store hours.,"So. 

Retail store setting, shortened hours due to the big rona, and that day, a lack of staff caused us to close pretty early, about 3 or 4 hours. 

I, the manager at the time, had to stay behind and process online orders leaving our store. I turned off all the lights, yoinked the metal doors closed, and proceeded with closing paperwork/deposits as I will not be selling anything for the rest of the day. 

All fine and good, until about an hour after, when I'm in the stockroom grabbing items for this pesky order. I emerge from the back, to find a man in my store browsing; knowing he has pulled open our CLOSED GATES and the sign apologising for the inconvenience. 

Me: ""hello sir, I'm very sorry, but we're closed!"" 

Man: ""No, you close at seven!"" *continues on his shopping adventure* 

Me, trying to be as polite as possible: ""Unfortunately not today, we had to close at three today due to lack of staff... I'm going to have to ask you to leave."" 

Man: ""No, you close at seven. I'll continue shopping. Thank you, I don't need help."" 

Me: ""Sir... Again we are closed, we have a sign up saying we are closed, and mall admin also knows we closed early, if you don't leave, I will have to call security."" 

This man gives me the dumbest look, literally drops the items he was looking at, shakes his head, and starts towards the doors. 

Man: ""You should really have a sign up saying you're closed."" As he opens the metal gates again, and leaves. 

I stood there, so astounded. 
I turned the lights, music, and outside store sign all off. The gates WERE CLOSED. And this man just... wanders in. 

Just.. why. 


TLDR: My store closed early, and a gentleman comes in anyway, arguing with me about the time we close.",TalesFromRetail,646,1600023848
Skelegirl97,This IDIOT bought a bag of 2 year old popcorn,"This just happened today. I work in a candy store with a popcorn section. The store opened at 9am, I wasn't scheduled until 11am. 

It took me until 3:30pm to even realize this. I was ringing out a woman and she asked about our popcorn sizes. It went as followed: W= woman; M= me

M: ""Hello mam, what can I do for you today?""

W: ""I want some cheddar cheese popcorn.""

M: ""okay, no problem. What size?""

W: ""What are your sizes?""

I point to the shelf above me with our displayed sized popcorn bags.

M: ""Well, we have the large bag only for butter for $3; we have the large flavored for $6.95; and we ha- uh.. Uh.. Umm... I'm sorry mam. Im a little caught off guard. We DID have a display bag for our regular size.""

She laughs at my confusion and we finished the transaction. Two minutes later my boss walks by and I call him.

M: ""Hey. Um, tell me,"" I point to the display shelf, ""did someone REALLY come in and STEAL our display bag?"" I can't hold my laughter.

I have never seen him look so confused as he sees the bag missing and he just keeps saying ""that is NASTY!""

M: ""That bag is 2 years old!"" I'm practically on the floor laughing at this point and I tell everybody! Not long after, I tell my coworker who works in the front and has been here since opening.

CW: ""Oh my God, that is disgu-.... Wait. Was it cheddar cheese popcorn in that bag?""

M: ""Yeah.""

CW: ""Oh my God. I SOLD it to him!""

So here's apparently what happened. Some guy came into our popcorn section, and instead of asking for help, he decided to grab our display bag that I guess he assumed was fresh. Even though it was cold and has the price written on it in faded Sharpe. Then went to my coworker and handed her the bag facing the other way so she didn't see the writing and paid $4 for it.

I have been laughing since this happened and I am waiting for this guy to call our store and complain about his stale, expired cheddar, 2 year old popcorn.",TalesFromRetail,1447,1599953156
BlueLightBookWyrm,Threatened a 17yof because his order had burnt in a warehouse fire.,"Hello, i thought I'd share a tale from my first ever job. I'm on mobile and English is my first (and only, sorry) language. The title is pretty much it tbh.

I used to work at a now shut homebase store in the UK. I worked up from a check out chick to staffing the customer service desk. I started at 16 years and quickly rose up. 

The day before this happened we had been informed that one of the warehouses that made and shipped new kitchens had been set on fire by accident by a group of kids messing around in it after finding a broken door that didn't lock properly. Unfortunately the fire killed 2 of the kids and seriously injured the rest of the kids. Starting a fire in a wood and chemical filled warehouse was a terrible idea but they were kids and didn't deserve that end and nightmares.

An email had gone out to people who had ordered a kitchen from us explaining that there was going to be a delay and they can wait or get a full refund and a 20% voucher.

I had been inundated with calls and people coming in asking for refunds and such in various degrees of anger but one stood out.

I had just swapped a screwdriver for someone who had gotten the wrong one. The old one was still on the desk when our protagonist turns up.

Cast Me-me, C- Customer 

Me - hello, how can I...........

C - what has happened to my fucking kitchen?

Me - ah sir I'm afraid that a fire in the warehouse has caused us to loose the entire stock of kitchens and......

C - I don't fucking care what happened to your fucking warehouse. I want my kitchen I've been waiting for weeks.

Me - please don't swear at me sir. 

C - I will do what I like. I want my kitchen, now.

Me - unfortunately sir due to the fire the kitchens will not be .........

This man just could not let me finish a sentence it seemed.

C - you don't listen do you. I want my kitchen

Me - Sir.....

At this point the customer hit his limit of sanity. He grabbed the screwdriver and started waving it at me. Luckily the desk was quiet high at about chest height and big enough to have 4 people work in the box without too much difficulty so I was able to back away from the mad man.

He was shouting at me at this point but I cannot tell you what he was shouting as I was just watching the screwdriver trying to not get stabbed. 

What our irate customer didn't know was that this store had a security guard (Steve) who was short, muscular, permanently angry and was a good friend of mine from all the time he spent leaning on the desk pretending to work. Steve had been watching from the other end of the line of checkouts where he was stood next to the exit to the shop.

At seeing the guy pick up the screwdriver Steve started sprinting towards us and fully flying rugby tackled the customer around the middle and to the ground slamming his head into the concrete floor. The customer dropped the weapon and Steve dragged him out of the shop and sat on him till the police arrived. 

It was when the police watched the cameras that i could see the flying tackle in all its glory. Steve was very proud of that take down. I think the customer did get his refund but I don't think he got the 20% discount voucher that others were offered.",TalesFromRetail,744,1595537321
MentalUproar,Elephant,"At my previous job, when a customer would buy a roomba, I would jokingly refer to it as an adoption and ask things like what they plan to name it while waiting for someone to get one down from top stock. One day, I make such a call and sarge responds.

Sarge, as you probably guessed, was military.  Any time he could work that into a conversation, he would. He also had some ridiculous beliefs, like all men are military members because if the US activates the draft again, we’d all be in. And we’d be his subordinates because he was there first. 

“I need a roomba e5.” I say over the radio.
“What?”
“Roomba. E5.”
“What?”
“Roomba. E5. Elephant 5”
“....wait a sec”

Sarge comes up and looks at the product card the customer brought up. “Echo. When you use a radio, e is echo.” Sarge walks off to get the roomba.
“What the fuck rhymes with elephant?” The customer snickers. We both knew sarge was just pushing my buttons.
“He better be careful. That ladder is about to hit that cord hanging from the ceiling.” Said the customer.
“No, we aren’t that lucky.” I responded. We laugh and start wasting time, waiting for the roomba.  It eventually arrives and sarge walks away.

“So, what are you planning on naming this?”
The customer pauses for a second, a smile forms and he gives his answer.

LongLiveMisanthrope,"""The Bathrooms Have To Be Along The Back Wall!""","Happened earlier today, still pretty miffed about it.

I work in the back room/receiving area of a large store who's building is older than I am. Anyway, there is a gate that normally goes across this back area blocking it off from the rest of the store with a sign on it saying, ""Employees Only Beyond This Point"". This is a nice thing to have as it allows me to do my work without being bothered by customers with questions, since I don't know much about our stock other than how much of it we have or when the next shipment is due. But unfortunately, most of my fellow employees don't understand it, and constantly leave it open when they come through, usually to just throw away trash. I am pretty tired of having to shut it at least 5 times an hour and sometimes just let it stay open.

Today, an older gentleman comes into the back while I am working, and just stands there, huffing to himself. Normally, I try to help out lost customers the best I can, but this guy just marched himself back there, into an area that is clearly different from the rest of the store and stood there, wrists on his hips and a pissed look in his eyes, so I pretend like I didn't see him and got back to work.

Just my luck, he doesn't take the cue and walks right up to me and huffs in the most perturbed voice I have heard from a customer thus far, ""Hey, where are your bathrooms?"" 

I, already having a bad day as we are slammed with freight and the night crew left half of their work laying about in my area, look at him and answer, ""Other side of the store, sir.""

""I just came from there,"" he huffs louder at me, ""and they are most certainly aren't there.""

Me, still not caring enough to deal with him, ""I am sorry, sir, but I know they are. They are between Electronics and the outside retail doors.""

\*crosses arms and narrows his eyes at me\* ""I didn't see them. I went up and down the back wall and it's not there.""

I sigh as I realize what's going on. I have to answer this same question daily. ""The bathrooms aren't along the back wall, its on the side wall. But still on the other side of the store.""

He then goes into a mini-tirade about how there should have been a sign (there are 3 and they are bigger than me) and how all bathrooms should be along the back wall.

Me, now getting pissed, ""Sir, its not on the back wall and can't be on the back wall.""

""Why not?""

""Because neither I, nor you, where here when the building plans were being drawn up. Now, if you want the restrooms, they are on the other side of the building.""

He starts huffing and trying to say something further but I cut him off. ""Sir, if you want I can show you to the bathroom."" He scowls at me, but agrees. I walk him towards the rest of the store and point above the racking at the ceiling on the other end of the building, ""Can you see the bathroom sign, sir?""

""Yes, finally!"" he huffs once more.

""Good!"" I say as he gets to the other side of where the gate goes, and I slam it close. ""You can handle the rest from here."" I can't say what his face was like after that as I turned on my heels and returned to work, but I do know he stood there for a hot second before stomping off towards the bathrooms.",TalesFromRetail,922,1595363938
ahylianhero,"""I TOLD YOU that you DO sell them here!""","I used to work at a medium department store popular for its overpriced furniture, imported foreign food and candy, and wine selection. Our stores tend to attract a lot of, ""The customer is always right,"" types because most items are just on the cusp of ""high-end"" retail. 

A customer walks in and wanders around the snack section for awhile before flagging me down. 

Customer: ""Yes, I'm looking for these chocolate Italian bears?""  
Me: ""I'm sorry, I've never heard of anything like that here."" (I should point out that I've worked at this particular location for five years and was the head of the gourmet department so I did all the inventory and stocking by myself. I also have a huge sweet tooth so if something new comes in, I don't miss it.)  
Customer: ""No, no, I bought it here last Christmas. I know you carry them. They're little chocolate bears in CLEAR cellophane wrapping."" 

I ask her if she can remember any part of the name and she's stumped, but insists they're here.

I'm thinking it must be a Christmas exclusive item so I go to our Italian aisle in Christmas and start looking around and then back to our regular chocolate aisle. I suggest a few similar Italian chocolates (maybe she just meant there was a bear on the package because Baci does have a polar bear on some of their boxes and that's Italian?) 

After thirty minutes, I give up and try to search keywords into our AS400 system. For those of you who were blessed to never deal with this system, it's an archaic application used for inventory but you have to spell things EXACTLY in order or the system either spits out 400 retired SKUs or nothing at all. 

The customer is starting to get irate that I'm trying to find the item in the computer and I can tell my actions of trying to go above-and-beyond are just annoying her because it doesn't look like I'm physically doing anything, so I finally just tell her that it doesn't look like that particular item is in stock anymore.

She leaves back to the chocolate section and not even five minutes later, comes stomping back to the register waving a white and red box in the air.

""I FOUND IT. I TOLD YOU that you DO carry it,"" she says in this sing-song smug as fuck voice.

I look at the box and reply, ""Ma'am, those aren't chocolate bears. They're Happy Hippos. And they're German."" 

As much as I'd love to tell you that she saw the error of her ways and apologized, she instead says, ""Well, you should have known what I meant.""

Edit: For people complaining that Kinder is Italian, in America, all imported items come with a fat paper label to give you the nutritional information in English. On any Kinder product, it says Product of Germany. In my store, items also have special labels on the shelf to say where it originates from, which ours says Germany and it is always grouped with the German candies. Kinder was also created in Frankfurt, Germany the year before it was introduced to Italy. Americans consider this a German product, so if you said Italian, you're not going to get what you're looking for unless you're specifically like, ""The ferrero brand"" (and even then, it's going to take the cashier a moment to figure it out. There's no giant logo aside from Kinder on the boxes). So yeah, made by an Italian company, but imported and made in Germany. Considered German here.",TalesFromRetail,1781,1595114118
TylPlas26,Customer Insults Me in Another Language. Didn’t Realize I Understood Her.,"So I come from a Dutch back ground. I am no where near fluent in the language. But I know enough that I can pick up some words and understand a few sentences. 

So about 8 years ago, I was helping a customer needing some paint made. As I’m mixing it, her phone rings, and she answers it and begins speaking in Dutch. 

As she is talking, I can pick that she’s telling whoever where they are, then they say something along the line of “I have one of these dumb young workers mixing it.” 

I say nothing. I decided to wait for the right moment as I mix her paint, as she continues talking. 

When her paint is done, I hand her can of paint to her. She says thank you, and I say in Dutch “You’re welcome. Goodbye.” 

She froze, her mouth open and then says “You speak Dutch?” I didn’t want to let her on how little I actually knew, so I just simply said “Yup.” She quickly darted for the cash area. It was very funny and rewarding.",TalesFromRetail,879,1594755297

mikachiqita,I accidentally insulted her but found her the perfect pair of jeans," This happened a long time ago but this thread made me think of this story.

My first job, when I was 18, was a corporate retail company known for their denim. This being my first job, I was learning about customer service and navigating my customer’s styling needs. I was very socially awkward but for the most part people liked working with me because I was honest but tried to be mindful of my feedback.
  As I was organizing the denim wall, a woman approached me for my help with finding a pair of jeans. I asked her what style of denim she was looking for and what size she feels comfortable in. By looking at her, she was on the curvier side with a pear shaped type body. I pulled out her size in an array of styles but especially presented our “curvy” fit denim to her and told her, “I feel like this fit is perfect for you!” She saw that it was a “curvy” fit and her face kind of fell but she headed into the fitting room to try them on. 
  I was helping other customers for a bit— when I went back to the fitting room to check on the woman with the jeans, she was gone. I asked my coworker that was working near the fitting rooms and cash register if he had seen my customer. He said that she just finished up and he rang her up already. He also went on to tell me that she said that I had made her feel really uncomfortable with the “curvy” fit jean comment but the jeans I picked out for her WERE a perfect fit.
  I felt so bad about the way I made her feel but I kind of laugh that the jeans did end up being a great fit for her.",TalesFromRetail,964,1591890025
accidentlyclueless,Lady yells at me for calling her daughter fat,"I (23f) work at a clothing store and this happened about 2 years ago. 

I had 3 customers left before I could start closing the store and go home. There was a mother and daughter,  and then another lady. The daughter (18/19 years old) walks up to the counter and her mother walks off to go look at something. She places a shirt on the counter (which was size: large) and asks me if we have an extra large as she doesn't think the large one will fit her. I scan the item and let her know that we do and that the system is telling me it should be on the rack. She said thank you and that she will go have a look. 

I was about to ask the next customer to come up to the counter when all of a sudden I hear:

""did you just call my daughter fat?!""

I was so confused. When I was talking to her daughter, the daughter was so nice and polite and thanked me for helping her. There was nothing 'off' about it.

""yes you did. You told her she needed another size""

Me: ""no,  I didn't. She asked for a larger size and I told her we have it""

""so my daughter is lying to me?""

Me: ""I didn't say that. I said she asked for a larger size and I said we have it""

I can't remember her exact words but basically she went on a rant (yelling across the counter) that went along the lines of: how rude I am, ""look at you,  do you think you're anything special"",""you should be ashamed"" and ""how dare you"".

This whole time,  her daughter is standing right next to her. Not saying a single word. 

I was still so confused by the whole situation and ended up going into the stock room to cry.",TalesFromRetail,1448,1591852506
FatalScroll,"Guy said her car was only worth $2,000 because of a squeaking door!","Hey guys! Long time lurker, first time poster!

I used to manage a oil change shop. I was actually working by myself that day as I had the slowest store in the company. 

I had an older Chinese lady (probably mid to late 60s) pull into my parking lot in a decent looking car. She spoke some English but you could tell it wasn't her first language. She seemed upset

Now this happened at least like 8 or 9 years ago so I don't remember specifically what was said but this is roughly how it went down.

Me: Hi, how are you?

Lady: Can you help me?

Me: Sure, what can i do for you?

Lady: Guy said car is junk, and will give me $2,000 for it and idk what to do...

So I take a gander outside and see her car. It was a 5 or 6 year old VW Jetta. Not new by any means but looks worth more that 2k.

Me: Whats wrong with it?

Lady: Its running rough, and the door squeaks. 

So I take a look under the hood and the Mass Air Flow Sensor was unplugged. Plugged it back in and applied some WD40 to the hinges. Start it back up and it runs perfect.

I went back inside and told her I fixed it but I wanted to blue book her car for her so she knew what it was worth. Car came up and as being worth about $7,500. I told her that guy was trying to rip you off and not to trust him.

She told me that a guy she brought it to told her that the engine was junk and was only going to get worse, and that her door was about to fall off! Whoever this was clearly saw she knew nothing about her car and would be easy to manipulate, and tried to flip her car for a nice payday!

I told her your car is fine and if you need ANYTHING you come and see me! She started crying and gave me a hug and went on her way. Didn't charge her a dime. Coolest moment in my many years of customer service!",TalesFromRetail,3585,1591686819
Marrah-Luna,It's a limit of ONE!,"This is a story the assistant manager of my department told me when I came in on Friday or Saturday, and it was too good not to share. For context, we were selling air conditioners at a discounted price of $100 instead of the $139.99 that they are regularly. We only sell these once a year as we're a grocery store, and I believe when we run out, we run out until the next year. The ACs were a limit of one and at this particular time of the story we had only two left. Nothing's direct quotes as I wasn't there to witness the event, but it gets the point across. 

My manager noticed a lady with the last two ACs in her cart, and thus informed her of the limit.

AL= AC lady

AM= Assistant Manager

OL= Other lady

AM: Miss, it's a limit of one AC per customer.

AL: Really? Well, where's the sign!?! I didn't see no such thing!

AM proceeds to show her the sign and the flyer that says limit one.

AL: Well, I need both! If that's the case then I'm just going to come back later when you're not here, or I'll send my husband to get the other one!

While AL and AM are arguing, OL comes up to ask AM a question.

OL: Excuse me, do you have any more air conditioners?  

AM: Sure! (proceeds to take the second AC out of AL's cart.) Here you go!

Doctor_Stonks,"Guy who stole $2,000 worth of equipment from our store comes back to shop the same day we find out what he looked like.","Hey, all! First time posting on here, so here we go.

I work at a relatively new grocery store in a small town in Washington. We've only been open for around nine months now and our customer count has been going up recently, so it gets a bit harder to keep track of customers. I usually work as a cashier most of the week on the closing shift, but I'll also throw freight in the aisles at least two days a week. Anyways, here's the story.

So, in our stockroom, we have four handheld scanners on docks ready to use by employees and managers to check prices, print tags, etc. On Saint Patrick's day, we somehow lost two of them. These things are worth a LOT of money, and at first, we thought two managers had just misplaced them. For the past month, they've been trying to track them with the Tile trackers they put on each device, and they've always shown to be just outside, or even in our parking lot. The owners were obviously confused, and have been trying to figure out what happened to them.

Yesterday, I came in for my shift as the closing cashier. I grab my uniform from my locker, put on my face mask, and grab my headset. As I'm in the front office getting my radio, one of the owners grabs my attention and shows me a printout of the security cameras. (from now on I'll just put them as O1 and O2 for owners 1&amp;2)

O1: So, we just found out who took our handhelds. It turns out he just walked straight to the back and just took them off the docks and walked right back out. We're pretty sure you were on your break at that point, did you see him? (the break room is just inside of the stockroom, but there aren't any windows or anything besides a slim one-way window on the door)

Me: I didn't see him, but he does look familiar... I'll keep an eye out for him. 

O2: if you see him, let us know. That's very valuable equipment he stole.

Me: yes, sir. I'll let you know if I see him. (I walk out and clock in)

So, I'm going about my normal shift, I count in my till, I do some facing around the store since there are two cashiers up front, currently

Then it happens. 15 minutes after I switch out registers with the opening cashier, THE GUY WALKS RIGHT IN AND GRABS A BASKET.

At first, I didn't recognize him. Even on the picture, he just looked like any ordinary guy. Luckily, our front end manager has years of experience so she spotted him no problem.

So she goes and ""faces"" the area he's in (acting like she's making it look pretty) and he's really interested in the chicken. The chicken that's right next to the stockroom.

Anyways a few minutes later he comes up with a full basket of goodies. As he's talking to me I hear the manager telling O2 he's in my line, and he's being rung up.

I freeze for a second because I mean, I couldn't say anything. Luckily I had a mask on so he couldn't see my look of shock come across my face. Anyways, O2 comes up and is acting like he's helping me bag. Then he suddenly starts a conversation with him.

(I'll put the customer as T for ""thief"")

O2: Hey, have you gone in this store before?

T: yeah, a few times. I'm a pretty frequent shopper...

O2: okay, cool, cool... Have you been here around March 17th?

T: *immediately starts acting nervous* uh, not that I know of...

O2: alright... *stops bagging* hang on one second, I'll be right back.

O2 went to the front office, I'm guessing to grab the printout they showed me earlier, and T's just sputtering.

Suddenly, T just looks up, does a 180, and just starts walking out. In the middle of my transaction. I actually had to shut down my register so I didn't get a line going.

SO, I then pull out my radio (the mic remote won't work, probably from the rain) and alert O2 he's trying to walk out, and he just Usain Bolts out the door after him, probably trying to ask him why he stole the handhelds, and then, as O2 is getting the guy's license plate, T TRIED TO RUN O2 OVER WITH HIS CAR!! Probably in view of the front surveillance camera! So the cops are called, charges were pressed, and now they know who he is (he's probably done this before, now that I think about it), and I'm just in shock.

Afterwards, I was profusely apologizing for not noticing it was him in the first place, but the manager just reassured me that I just didn't have experience in identifying people like that. She had around nine years in experience to boot, that's why she was able to spot him.

Anyways, let's hope there's an end to that whole deal and we can get our two handhelds back, lol

TL;DR: The same day we find out who stole our handhelds, the thief shows up and gets a dose of karma.

Update: I forgot to mention that when he stole those handhelds, he did it with no hesitation, and like he knew what he was doing. It was an insane breach of privacy, and no one even noticed..",TalesFromRetail,1763,1586875312
CutlassKitty,"No, I cannot give you your £4 change in notes","Short one for my first post cause this always makes me laugh.

Small background - I work in a clothing store in the UK. This clothing store is known for being pretty cheap, not high end at all.  It's a busy Saturday and suddenly a group of 10 young girls (9-13 age range, I'm bad with ages) join the queue, with one older woman at the end. Serving them itself was frustrating as they had no idea how the card machines worked and wouldnt stop chatting to listen to me try and explain. 

So, I'm already a bit frustrated when I serve the older woman. She asks for a bag, I tell her the are 5p, she gets annoyed and says she doesnt want the change. She asks if we have any tissue she could wrap her purchase in, and I say sorry no, just the bags. As I said earlier, we are a fast fashion cheap clothing shop. She makes a snide comment about how we she have tissue, I jsut keep scanning. 

In the end, her purchase comes to £6. She hands me £10. I hand her 2 £2 coins (the smallest amount of coins possible). She looks at me, sneers, and asks can she have it in notes as she doesnt want change. I pause to process, then tell her her change is £4 so I cannot give it to her in notes. She looks at me like I'm stupid, then takes her change and walks away.

Some customers really dont understand they can be wrong!

rhxannon,All over 5p,"I work in a sports retailer in the UK. It was a few days before Christmas and as you’d assume, it’s very busy. It was coming to the end of my long shift and I’d been on the till all day. A gentleman and (I’m assuming) his son approached the till and I started to scan his items. First impression I could tell the gentleman had no manners. The encounter went:

Me: ‘would you like a bag at all?’

Gentleman: ‘no’ 

Me being exhausted, I accidentally scanned and charged him a 5p bag and didn’t realise.

5 minutes he comes back up to my till (without his son) and slams his receipt on the till. 

Him: ‘YOU ASKED ME IF I WANTED A BAG AND I SAID NO SO WHY HAVE YOU CHARGED ME FOR ONE’

Me: ‘Oh I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to do that. Would you like me to refund you the 5p’

Him: ‘THAT’S NOT THE POINT THOUGH YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE DONE IT’

Me: ‘I’m really sorry, it’s been a really busy day and I’m very tired. It was a genuine mistake and I apologise. Would you like the 5p refunded?’

Him: ‘YOU STILL SHOULDN’T HAVE DONE IT’

At this point a queue of customers behind him was forming.

Me: ‘I’ve apologised and said it was a mistake all I can do now is give you the 5p refund. Would you like the 5p back?’

Him: (looking a bit hopeless) ‘yeah’

I give him the 5p refund and he walks off. I tell him to have a nice day and he says nothing to me. The customers in the queue were laughing at him and asking me if I’m okay. 

I later ask my manager if the gentleman mentioned anything to him. He told me that he requested my manager talk to me about the mistake I made. My manager laughed it off with me and said he was tempted to offer him 10p from his wallet and keep the change. Also, his son was standing at the front door hanging his head in shame.

Moral of the story is, I’ve accidentally charged customers for £50 tracksuits and they’ve been polite about it and even laughed about it. It’s a mistake and it’s easily corrected.",TalesFromRetail,807,1586774236
UnusualHiccup,The Smoking Man,"I work at a food store in the UK, and unfortunately one of the roughest in the town. As you all probably know, smoking inside establishments is a big no-go. Pubs, stores, etc., nope.

Day started off okay, we had our delivery, we were on time with everything, but then two of our genuinely nice customers came up to me and said that an older man was smoking in the middle aisle of the store. This was a new one to me.So I go down there, and to my surprise, there was indeed a man smoking there in the aisle while casually doing his shopping. I calmly went up up to him and asked him to extinguish the cigarette, and he shouted back at me saying that ""It's a shop! Yes I can!""

Small back and forth ""No you can't""/""Yes I can"" until I said that since he's refusing to extinguish the cigarette, I was going to have to ask him to leave. He then threatened to take me to court, tried to physically take my name badge, and when I refused to let him have it, he pinned me up against the shelving units. Luckily we have headsets, so I called for some help from my other colleagues. The manager comes over, a fair bit younger than me and quite new to the store. He asks the man to leave, and then the man starts assaulting him as well. We eventually had to physically remove him from the store and called the police.

AnimalAnime,That time we had to call the cops.,"Hello. 

I’m gonna call crazy man CM, my coworker CW and my manager M.

So at the time I was working in a place that sells undergarments for both men and women.  Men’s was actually our best selling department. The most important fact to know in this story is that boxers cost more than boxer briefs.

Moving right along, you know how customers just love to pick things up and abandon them in the wrong place? Well this time that ended up with a butterfly effect in which we needed to call the police and get security escorts to our cars at the end of the night due to an absolutely psychotic man not getting his way.

We had both a wall lined with products for men as well as a couple bins in the men’s section for excess stock for customers to take what they needed. One of these bins contained boxer briefs. I’m sure you all know where this is going.

A large red-headed man, like at least 6 foot and 250 (muscular) walks up to CW’s register with a pack of boxers and a pack of socks to get our BOGO 50% off promotion. This is CM.

CW (who’s a little old lady btw) rings up his items and tells him his total. I’m on the register next to her as it was a busy weekend day so I can hear all of this (Not that I’ll need to be that close). CM starts flipping out.

CM: Why is it so expensive? I didn’t pick anything up that expensive.

CW: Well the socks cost [this much] and the boxers cost [this much]. So with the sale that’s what the total comes too.

CM: No. The boxers cost less then that. I read the sign they definitely cost less.

CW: Would you mind showing me where you picked these up sir?

*CM brings her over to the boxer brief bin*

CW: I’m sorry sir. It looks like another customer put these in the wrong spot. *Pointing to where the boxers are on the wall* They’re actually [this much.]

My manager was in the men’s section and stopped what she was doing to listen in.

CM: Well you had them in the wrong place so you have to honor that price.

CW: Sir I don’t have control of where other customers leave things. There are no other boxers in this bin. They cost [this much].  If it was an error on our part I would honor it, but it isn’t.

CM: YOU NEED TO HONOR THE PRICE!

CW: No sir. I can remove the item if you aren’t interested.

CM: ARE YOU STUPID?! YOU NEED TO DO WHAT I SAID! 

*Manager intervenes*

M: Excuse me sir, what seems to be the problem?

CM: I FOUND BOXERS HERE IN THIS BIN AND YOUR EMPLOYEE WON’T HONOR THE PRICE!

M: I’m sorry sir it looks like a customer put them there. We cannot give you the boxers for the price of boxer briefs.

CM: I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A STORE THAT TREATS CUSTOMERS LIKE THIS! YOU NEED TO GIVE ME THEM AT THAT PRICE BECAUSE THAT’S WHERE I FOUND THEM!

M: Sir, I do not have the authority to change the prices.

At this point literally the entire store has stopped and is staring at a distance at this enraged linebacker of a man screaming. 

CM: YES YOU DO! YOU CAN CHANGE THE PRICE! DO IT NOW!

M: I can’t do that sir.

CM: I OUGHTA PUNCH YOU IN YOUR SMART MOUTH!

M: Sir, I’m going to have to ask you to leave.

CM: NO! YOUR GONNA GIVE MY BOXERS! *He has his finger in her face* AT THE LOWER PRICE! NOT YOUR RIP OFF PRICE!

At this point I left to call security and apparently a couple of people had called police after the man threatened my manager. He’s still screaming but I can’t tell what he’s saying. The police department is only a few minutes down the street from the store so by the time I was finished with security the police were in the store and escorting the man who was still raging out.

Security arrived maybe 5 minutes later and ended up escorting me and my manager to our cars after closing later as people reported that he was threatening us all.

In case you were wondering this was all over $2.50.",TalesFromRetail,1334,1578076833
mintyzebras,I’m their favourite cashier,"So I work as a cashier in a supermarket and i always see a couple and their two daughters (aged maybe around 5-10 years old?) shopping in our store each weekend. They always come to my register and they are so kind and lovely and their daughters help them unpack the shopping trolley/cart and sometimes they’ll come to me and ask if they can scan some items. While I scanned and packed their items we would chat about how our day and the daughters would also talk to me about their day and the little toy they got or the chocolates and sweets they got. Instead of calling me “the lady” they call me by my actual name or my nickname they made up for me. They were just adorable.

One day when the store I work in was really really busy there was this long line on my register and they were third in the line. When this happens we have to call someone from another department to help us in the checkouts. So one of my colleagues comes along and tells the couple and their daughters to go on their checkout. They were about to go until one of their daughters told their mum that they wanted to stay and get served by me. Here’s a little dialogue of how their conversation went:

Daughter 1: But mummy, we want to stay here and get served by [my name]

Mum: But this lady is taking us to her checkout

Daughter 1: But we don’t want to go to that lady!

Mum: why don’t you want to go to her checkout? 

Daughter 2: Because I want to stay here and let [my nickname they made up] scan our things! 

Mum: But this other lady will scan our things too! 

Daughter 1: But I want [my name]

Dad: Why [daughter’s name]?

Daughter 2: Because she’s our favourite cashier! 

Dad: oh okay we’ll stay with [my name]

And the girls cheered and were soooo happy that they were going to stay at my checkout. And when I heard that it pulled at smile on my face and honestly made my heart melt. 

So the mum told my colleague that they’re just going to be patient and wait for their turn. My colleague just nods her head and takes the person behind them in the line. When it was their turn the girls cheered and gave me high fives, they sang a little song about being in my checkout and the parents just laugh and tell me “wow they really do like you!” And I say “I guess so hahaha!” I talked to the parents about their day while the kids also talked to me about their day and help their parents put their items on the checkout. They even wanted to help me scan their items and so I let them scan their stuff. 

At the end, they hugged me and said “thank you [my name]!!! You’re the best! I can’t wait to go to your register again!” And the parents smiled at me and said “thank you for serving us and have a wonderful day.” Before they left me my manager arrived and while my manager was there and they were telling her that I’m their favourite cashier and how they don’t want me to leave haha.

I asked my manager and he said, “well if he makes it before 8 pm, sure he can come in and get the watch.”

So I told him what my manager said and we waited. Clock hits 7:59 and we start to close. Sure enough the guy pulls up at 8:03 and starts yelling at us about how we could have waited two more minutes. 

Personally I wanted to say “hey man, we said if you can make it before 8 pm, we’d be able to help you out but it’s past that time, that’s when the shop closes.” Instead he kept talking about how his five year old son is going to be so sad so I decided to ignore him.

OGWhiz,Plain package cigarettes will be my death,"Plain packaging has been introduced in Canada for cigarettes. This means the branding cannot include colour or logos, and the packaging for all companies needs to be a mat brown colour with a standardized font. Cigarettes require you to learn a new language anyway, especially when customers don’t actually know what they’re asking for. A small pack is 20 cigs, large is 25, but there’s also regular and king sized so people get confused and often ask for “a small next blue regular king size 25s” which is literally asking for every different next blue pack we have. So now that colours are banned in branding, we have to learn a whole new language and the customers just refuse to accept it. I’ve been telling every tobacco customer since April that this would be happening come November, and now it’s November. So a man walks in and asks me for a 25 pack of next blue regular. Next blue is now called next original, and it comes in it’s brown packaging with no logos. I have the brand descriptor guide next to my register for the inevitable “no, I want next BLUE..” arguments. This weapon proved worthless with this man.

Him: those are brown..

Me: yes that’s the new standard for Canadian tobacco as of yesterday, this is called plain packaging. All companies are going to be abiding by these rules, so next blue is now called next original and comes in this brown packaging.

Him: No I want next BLUE.. not original.

Me: These are next blue. It’s the same cigarette, same blend, same company. All cigarette packages are going to look like this by the end of February.

Him: alright I don’t care about all that, I just want next BLUE cigarettes.

Me: these are next blue.

Him: No, they’re clearly brown.

So I pull out the description guide, open up to the “Next” brand page, and show him that it says next blue is now called next original.

Him: alright but why can’t you just give me next blue?

Me: These are next blue, they changed the name to next original.

Him: alright nevermind.. fuck it.. I’ll be calling your head office to tell them you aren’t carrying the right products.


Plain packaging isn’t even in full effect yet and people are already fighting with me. I hate this.",TalesFromRetail,2877,1572703434

A usual day at work, serving customers. I notice a beautiful newborn baby in her pram quietly fast asleep in the corner of the store.

Da_potato_queen9976,The lady that tried to steal discounts,"So this just happened and I'm just calming down in the back rn.

So I work in a supermarket in the netherlands. In our specific location we have a few people we always keep an eye on from the moment they walk into the store because they attempted to steal a variety of things repeatedly. This story is about one such person, who we will call TL for thief lady.

So I'm just restocking the freezers and find an old discount card. The ones that show the discount and are put in front of the actual product. This one was from two weeks ago. Now you need to know that theres a rule at our store that if a customer finds one of these old cards that are forgotten sometimes, they still get the discount. Regulars know this rule and get very up our ass about it by saying things like ""why did they get a discount on this product and I didnt ?!"" ""But I found a card yesterday!!"" Etc.

Anyway, I found one and put it on my cart to take to the back. There were also some products I was restocking on that cart so I wasnt wary when TL looked at my cart. But then when I turned around to ask her if I could help her with something, she snatched the discount card away and speed walked to the products that the discount was for. I followed her, cause this is obviously not allowed, saying ""ma'am, could I have that back please, that card isn't valid anymore."" But she completely ignores me. She grabbed the product and speed walked to the self-scan registers cause those dont have a line and immediately showed the cashier the card. 

So I'm pretty shy and non-confrontational, but I just got real pissed today. I told the cashier she snatched the card off of my cart and it wasnt valid, so the woman turns around and starts her whole show.

TL: ""how do you mean I took it? I found it in the freezer!"" 

Me: ""no, I found it in the freezer ten minutes ago, you just snatched it and ignored me when I told you that wasnt allowed. 

Well, like I said, there were people keeping an eye on her, so without me or the cashier calling anyone, the cashier manager showed up.

We explain both sides and the woman starts her whole sad act again but then she said something to really make my blood boil.

TL: ""you're just accusing me of stealing because I'm brown!"" 

Low blow in my opinion.

Me: ""let's check the cameras then, see who's right.""

Lady knew she was in the wrong so mumbled something about just accepting what's happening and gave me the card back.

Our tale begins on a Saturday. The busiest day of the week at our store and the day that everything that can go wrong, will go wrong. I was the customer service manager at the time and get called to the front because a cashier needs help with a return. 

Cast: B: me, very tired CSM C1: First cashier  M: overworked manager IC: incompetent customer

&gt;C1: Hey B! This customer has an online return. I can't find anything on his receipt besides his membership charge. He says (insert online retail giant here) told him to bring the return here. 

IC is visibly upset and is angrily scrolling thru his phone to find his email with his receipt.
&gt;IC: I TOLD HER I ALREADY TALKED TO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SHE HAS TO DO MY RETURN. 

&gt;B: Okay sir, I'm so sorry for the trouble. What are we returning today and can I have your email? I can look up your online purchase with our database. 

&gt;IC: Its this damn comforter set, its supposed to be grey but look its green! I can't believe (online retail giant) sent me the wrong color! And you guys don't have it in store!

I get the customer's email, look him up in the system and see that the only online purchase he has had with the company was for our membership program. No online orders from us at all. I explain this to the customer he tells me that he bought the item from online retail giant but when he called them to do a return they told him to come to our store. 

Now, I know a certain clothing chain has started taking online retail giant returns but we are not that store. So I ask the customer if he meant he was supposed to go to that store. Nope, he was told to come here. I ask to see the item in question. He pulls it out of a garbage bag.

&gt;IC: See! I told you it's green not grey! Now can you return it already so I can get a different one?

&gt;B: Sir I'm sorry but we have no record of you buying this from us. Let me see if we carry this item. 

&gt;IC: Its a comforter, OF COURSE YOU CARRY IT.

I'm getting to the end of my rope with this guy. As a try and find a tag on the comforter he's yelling at me and C1 about how stupid we are and that we can't do a simply return why are we even working here. At this point M shows up, there's a line at the front because the customer is refusing to move to the side so C1 can take other customers and is being quite loud. 

&gt;M: Hey B, what's going on?

&gt;B: This customer has a return from online retail giant that they were told to bring here. 

&gt;M: We don't fulfill for online retail giant. Sir are you sure you weren't told to go to clothing store?

&gt;IC: WHY ARE YOU ALL SO STUPID. I WAS TOLD TO COME HERE BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR COMFORTER AND YOU HAVE TO DO MY RETURN.

At this point I have found the tag on the comforter. The brand is online retail giant basics. Pretty much the online retail giants store brand.  VINDICATION! 

&gt;B: I'm sorry sir but the tag on the comforter shows that it is from online retail giant, not us. I cannot do a return for an item from another retailer that we do not carry. 

&gt;IC: WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU WON'T DO MY RETURN. I WANT YOUR MANAGER.

&gt;B: Sir, I am the customer service manager but M is right here and is another manager. 

&gt;M: Sir B is correct we can't do this return. You need to call online retail giant about your return. 

I wish I could say there was a better ending but that was it. IC didn't say a word, just mumbled under his breathe and stalked out of the store with his hefty bag comforter. I did receive an email later that night for a customer complaint but M and I had already written out an incident report to alert the other stores in the area incase he tried the same thing somewhere else so neither of us were written up for violating our stores ""never say no"" policy. 

And that kids is how I spent 30 minutes explaining to a man that I couldn't do a return on an item from another store.",TalesFromRetail,880,1572274710
Ashleyyyy96,5 Hour Energy = drugs,"I'm a manager at a gas station/convenience store in a pretty wealthy area. Having worked for this company for almost 5 years, I have so many crazy customer stories that I could write a book. This is the first one in a while that actually made me laugh, so I thought I'd make my first post here.

A customer comes in yesterday, walks up to the counter and picks up a 5 Hour Energy shot. I greet her, she ignores me and squints at the bottle for about 30 seconds, turning it all around reading the label. She finally asks ""Do you have to be over 21 to buy these? Because of the bad stuff?"" I told her it's intended for 18 and up and it's mostly just caffeine and B vitamins (to my knowledge, never really paid too much attention to them). She goes ""So does it get you high or what? It's drugs? Speed?! I found one in my son's room, he's only 19 so I don't know how he got into these. I'm so dissapointed."" and walks out without waiting for a response from me. I feel bad for her son, poor kid probably got a lecture on ""drugs"" when she got home.",TalesFromRetail,1068,1572219420
sad_skelly,Man gets mad at me for not handing him €500,"I work as a cashier in a bookshop. We keep a floating €100 in the till at all times, but most people choose to pay by card so there usually isn’t much cash in the till at the end of the day. 

A couple of weeks ago, a man came in the shop and interrupted me while I was cashing out some books for another customer. He said that he worked nearby and his boss wanted him to exchange €500 because they were out of smaller notes and coins. 

He asked me to give him €500 from the till and he would be back in a moment with the €500 note divided differently. Obviously I refused, there was no way I was going to let this guy walk out with €500 because it would be on me to pay it if he stole it or lost it, and anyway we didn’t even have that amount in the till. 

When I said absolutely not, he raised his voice and scolded me for not being helpful and tried to persuade me into “helping him” and he got a little bit aggressive when I kept saying no. I’m glad there were a lot of people in the store at that moment because otherwise I don’t know if he would have escalated the situation.",TalesFromRetail,1822,1572178911
ugotopia123,Lighthearted story of an express cashier,"So I was on express register 1, way end of the store while every other coworker was on the other side. I'm more casual here since I'm not as supervised, but also because I don't want to outwardly express my overall disdain for express. I'm not usually quick-witted so I felt proud of this joke and thought I'd share. Mobile, apologies, blah blah.

A nice old lady comes up to my register buying a single small item. When anyone buys just one thing I always ask if they want a bag.

&gt; Me: Did you want a bag for this?

&gt; Lady: (joking) No thanks, as long as you guys won't stop me in the parking lot!

&gt; Me: (joking back) You have the receipt so they won't tackle you on the way out

&gt; Lady: (chuckles) That would be pretty bad at my age!

&gt; Me: Oh don't worry about that, we're not [competing store down the road]!

Screech32210,“I can’t keep both? You’ll hear from my lawyer”,"This happened over the span of a few weeks, and was finally all over yesterday. 

I sell household appliances for a living. It sucks but it’s decent money.

 A few weeks ago a coworker sold a lady a washer for her new house. She keeps it a few days, then calls us saying it’s making weird noises. We send our tech out and he takes a look. Nothing wrong with it. No “weird” noises. But we’re a large corporation and try to make customers happy, so we agree to swap it. 

The delivery crew gets there, and start taking the old one out, this is when all hell breaks loose. 

Lady: “Why are you taking my washer?? That’s mine. I payed for it!”

Delivery: “yea, but we’re exchanging it for a new one. So we take the old one that you claim is broken, and swap it for a new one.”

Lady: “that wasn’t the deal. I’m keeping both for the trouble you all caused me!”

Delivery: “if you don’t let me take this one, we’re not bothering taking the other one off the truck. Pick one. You don’t get both.”

Lady: “I’ll sue!”

Delivery: “okay, we’re leaving”

Lady calls the store, she’s furious. First thing she says is “I’m suing you. This is so unfair”

Manager: “we’ve already talked to legal. We have been told not to make contact with you. You have to do everything through legal/corporate now. Sorry. Have a good day.”

Lady: “....WHAT? WHY? I wasn’t actually going to sue?!”

Manager: “you said you were. That’s all we needed to hear. Contact legal with the name and phone number of your lawyer. They’ll get you taken care of. Thanks bye.”


Lady never called a lawyer, never called the legal department. But yesterday she sends an email saying she would really appreciate the swap now. Delivery laughs. Store manager laughs. She’s not getting that washer.",TalesFromRetail,3482,1571923844
tife-eny,Company policy is on receipt but she refuses to read it,"I work at a retail store where we have frequent and regular customers (that we know by name) that continuously come in to exchange clothes they bought but can't refund. 

Our policy is that we will refund full price items within 14 days. With our sale items we can only exchange within 14 days. However we also have a policy that anything, sale or full price, can ONLY BE EXCHANGED after the 14 days. This is all printed on the bottom of every receipt. 

This lady comes in with a sale item asking for a refund (she was well over 14 days as well ) and I told her that we could only exchange it for her. She has a fit and says that she doesn't like the item and it doesn't fit blah blah blah. I told her that ""I'm sorry, we can only exchange it for something else in the store"". She asked for my manager and I gladly call her out. Guess what? My manager repeats the exact same thing. 

Now she acts all innocent and says that she didn't know that was our policy and that it wasn't clear. My manager and I looked at each other and rolled our eyes mentally. I highlighted the bottom of the receipt and showed it to her, stating that our policy was clearly printed on the receipt. 

She ended up taking her top to ""a better store"". 

Good riddance.",TalesFromRetail,664,1571753731
Writer4God,Customer gets angry when I uphold company policy,"When I worked for a thrift store, there were discounts offered to military, seniors, students, etc.  For any discounts, proof must be offered via VALID ID.  This has pissed off tons of customers who qualified but did not have valid ID (exceptions have been made in certain situations).

&amp;#x200B;

""Karen"" and her daughter were shopping at the thrift store and comes to my till.  I do my usual spiel of asking if she had any qualifying discounts while I ring up her stuff.  Karen says ""student"" and I ask for ID.  She motions for her daughter to come to the register, who happens to be wearing a school uniform with a school logo on it.  Now, with this, I cannot give her the discount.  It has to be a physical ID.  I tell the customer and she is immediately irate, saying that her daughter's school uniform should be enough (it isn't).  She blabs to someone over the phone while I continue to ring her stuff, totaling over $80.  She then ends the call and asks if I got her discount and I politely told her that I didn't and that I needed a physical school ID.

&amp;#x200B;

Karen then proceeds to tell me that other stores do it too and that I'm the ONLY one in the store who doesn't give her the discount without an ID, blah blah blah (this one hurt me personally and I don't know if she said this to make it personal or what).  This customer is nothing but rude to me for the entire transaction. After the transaction was finished, she left and I told my supervisor everything she said and the supervisor lets me know that the reason why I'm the ""only one that does that"" is because I'm doing my job.",TalesFromRetail,1153,1571719836
MythrilDill,Woman in charge of defective merchandise ends up being a thief.,"This happened about 15 years ago while I was working at a store we will just call J-Mart. I was one of those employees that was too useful, so I was trained on practically every department in the store so I got pretty much free run of the floor. I also happened to become pretty good friends with our Loss Prevention guy so I got roped into operation ""Catch the rat"". 

We had one lady that was in charge of sending defective or discontinued merchandise back to where ever it came from before we got it. She was a rather blunt and unpleasant lady to begin with and had zero friends on the staff. 

Anyway, LP started to piece together a puzzle about missing items, seeing that the departments that she was working resets and pulling old products off the shelf ended up having extra missing items. We ended up hiding a camera in the rafters right above the designated area for defective items and slowly pieced together her scheme. She would take extra products off the shelf while removing the ones she was supposed to return and hide them in some extra boxes for a few weeks until the reset and restock of the area was finished, then she would bag up the stolen items and walk them right out the front door. Since nobody liked her, nobody wanted to check her bags or even talk to her on her way out the door.

She got caught though, they let it go on for several months after they figured out what she was doing so they could have hours of video evidence of her thefts.  One day, the LP guy told me to take a break at the time she normally left and be outside the front door. She walked out right on time and right into the arms of several police officers who were waiting for her. During the few months they were watching her, they counted over six digits worth of merchandise that she had walked out the front door with. I did get interviewed by a detective and explained my role in the investigation, that being going behind her and taking stock of the merchandise that was left in the area so they could tell what was missing, but I never got called to go to court. She ended up going to jail and I am fairly sure she is still in there.",TalesFromRetail,941,1571689984
howsmallarewe,Redesigned Front End is killing me !,"I work for a giant corporate retail home improvement hardware chain....recently they decided redesigning the entire front end from returns to check out was a great idea. Without consulting actual cashiers or customers they removed the counters - the 3 feet of safe space between customers &amp; the associates who interacts with them in favor of  a ""shoulder to shoulder"" check out experience.  Confused , upset customers abound !

As you can imagine THAT in it's self has spawned many many ""fun"" stories but my tale this morning is about the flow of our new returns area &amp; the customers who refuse to come in thru the entrance. This story is repeated every day, every hour, almost every minute of our day at the new service desk.

&amp;#x200B;

Our desks are now called ""pods"" each working desk features a register that can toggle between a sales registers, a returns register, order release, and special services. Meaning each register &amp; the worker behind it is expected to do everything. Sadly the customer struggles to understand if you are standing looking at your screen you are actually ""working"".  

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I was returning a bunch of electrical pieces for a customer, one his switches did not have a scan tag , we happen to be right next to electrical so the customer ran to go get one I could scan, my desk is filled with more bags of his returns so I keep scanning as he runs off to grab one - as soon as he leaves the desk a woman walks up from the exit behind me , on her phone....I hear "" ....WELL THEN I WILL FIND ANOTHER BANK!! GOOD BYE!!""....and she hangs up. 

I am trying not to look at her because I am clearly working ....I head motion to the few people who are standing waiting in line as she pushes closer to the edge of my desk. Pointing to the line I say ""Ma'am the line for service starts right there."" 

As I say this the guy gets back with his switch &amp; he hands it to me. To my shock this lady says ""EXCUSE ME I WAS HERE FIRST !"" to the guy.

Normally I am a very patient person but this new lay out has me working on my last nerve... I calmly but firmly look directly at her and say ""Ma'am, I told you the line for service starts right there , there are people ahead of you. I was working with this gentleman before you walked up to my desk from THE EXIT....The entrance starts RIGHT THERE!""

Her - ""NO I WAS HERE FIRST ! I JUST HUNG UP ON A VERY IMPORTANT CALL HAD I KNOWN I WOULD HAVE NOT HUNG UP NOW I HAVE TO CALL THEM BACK.""

Me: ""Ma'am I suggest you call her back while you are waiting in line. I will get to you as soon as I can.""

Meanwhile I am scanning returns the entire time.

Her- ""WHAT IS YOUR NAME !""

The poor guy is just standing there looking totally confused and I can see he is starting to feel protective of me which happens a lot in retail when rude people attack service workers. He doesn't miss a beat and says to the lady...""Her name is right there. I guess that explains why you couldn't read the exit sign either!""

At this she storms out the entrance , pushing back thru the people waiting , while getting back on her phone. I am not sure if she was calling the bank she hung up on or my manager &amp; don't care either way.",TalesFromRetail,1250,1571671740
ask-me-about-my-ween,"And she would have gotten away with it, if it werent for us meddling retailors!","Im a custom framer and i had a customer make a $400 order. She was surprised at the price and asked why it was so high so i went into my speech of the benefits what the process is yadda yadda. She said ok and then paid for her piece. I told her it would be two week and we will give her a call when its ready.  
  
Next day I came in to a negative review on the shop from the same woman saying the prices were waaaaaay too high! I shrugged it off because she literally went up the wrong channel for that compaint and it will go nowhere. Doesnt matter if i go to higher ups to say ""customers are saying too expensive"" since all they say is ""youre a sales person sell."" So... Yeah... But i could tell this customer was going to be a pain.  
  
Two weeks pass and the piece is ready and looks pretty good. I give her a call and she comes to pick it up. ""Oh it looks great! But I want to refund""  
  
""Im sorry?""  
  
""Its just too expensive and i want my money back""  
  
If thats what she wants ya know? So i said ""ok give me one moment to remove the art"" and i picked up the piece.  
  
""Oh! No no no i dont want it removed!""  
  
""But you want a refund?""  
  
""Yeah but its already in the frame.""  
  
""And it will take me all of 5 minutes to remove it""  
  
""Oh... Since it took two week I thought..."" And she trailed off.  
  
""Ma'am are you wanting the frame?""  
  
""Yes!""  
  
""And a refund?""  
  
""Yes!""  
  
""Well thats just not how that works. You have two options you sign this paper saying our business is done and that we did everything that you wanted and you take your new framed piece home without a refund *or* you get a refund and no frame.""  
  
She was pissed but signed the form and left with her art. I was baffled. How she though she had the perfect plan for a free frame is beyond me.

MissyBThyName,They're Always A Secret Shopper,"Hello, long time lurker, first time poster, on mobile, 

So this just happened, im in my lunch now. Im a key at an underwear store and its been fairly busy recently so we have a lot of associates on the floor. Im one of the younger managment so a lot of the younger associates tend to like me and feel comfortable talking to me normally. 
An associate (lets call her C) and i are standing near the doors juat talking about random stuff and greeting people as they come in and asking if they need help with anything. After helping or confirming the customer is okay, we go back the same spot and continue our convo. We're also right by the check out and a lady (SS) walks up to the counter and i go to meet her and begin ringing her up. As follows:

Me: Hi! Find everything alright?

Ss: You know, you should really say hi to your customers instead if chit chatting.

Im shocked for a split second because thats exactly what we've been doing and this lady hadnt walked in at any time while we were standing there. She only had items from the other side of the store in a completely different section from where we were, too, and never asked either of us for help. I turn and see C give the lady a shocked look before just responding ""...Alrighty.""

I ring her up as normal, saying nothing except the prompts to get her through the transaction. When we're done i hand her her bag and say:

Me: All set, have a nice day!

SS: You know, you need to be nicer to your customers, you never know when theres a secret shopper, MissyBThyName!

She begins to walk off and i cant help but start laughing and just say ""We dont do that here"" to my shocked associate (not C) next to me. Im pretty sure SS heard me, i saw her turn right as she left the door to look at me, but i shook it off and helped the next person in line. I laughed about with C afterward and with my manager later on.

I know the lady was bluffing cuz we've never done secret shoppers ever in our store (I've been here for 2.5 years) and secret shoppers are under no circumstances supposed to say or suggest that they're a secret shopper. So idk what that ladies problem was but im lowkey hoping she tries calling later and reporting me cuz all of my managers love me and id love to see how that goes down.",TalesFromRetail,1481,1571523273
welcometothepotato,Rude man wants helmet for his child,"I work at a bike store and 99% of the customers are fantastic and I love serving them. Occasionally you get a guy like this. I was just about finished serving someone when the next person in line to be served (rude man = RM) says, ""do I have to call to get service around here.""

Me: ""I'll be with you in just a second, I'm just finishing with this man.""

RM: says nothing

Me to RM: ""how can I help y-?"" 

RM: ""I need a helmet for my son""

I take him over to the helmets and ask if I could try one on for size so I could let him know which models will fit his son. 

RM: completely ignoring the question, ""what colours does this one come in?"" 

me: I point and explain all the colours and add, "" this also comes in a black which I can order in and a blue which I can get from the ba-”

RM: ""get it""

I get the helmet and show it to him,

RM:  ""the blue one?""

me: ""this is the blue one""

RM: ""you said you were getting the blue one""

Me: ""I've got it right here in my hands""

RM: ""that's aqua. I'll have a black one ordered in""

I can't remember how the dialogue went after this but I had to explain I would have to try one in another colour in his son before we ordered the black one in to make sure it would fit correctly. He didn't like that at all but I mentioned if the son fits another style better then we would likely have the black one in stock and the father changed his tune pretty quickly. We had a sale for these helmets that finished a while ago and he asked if we'd do it for the sale price. Typically we would say yes because there's a lot of room to move with these helmets and we like to make sure people (especially kids) actually have them to wear, so we discount them often - but not this time. Not a chance I was gonna take a cent off the helmet after he acted like that in front of his kid. 

tbh the helmet is more of an aqua colour, but it is definitely darker than your typical aqua. Most of the time I'm showing the helmet to kids and it's so much easier just to tell them it's blue and even kids understand.",TalesFromRetail,1084,1571489772
cplumbtree,A Lady Screamed in My Face For Doing My Job,"Side note: This is my very first post and I’m on mobile, so sorry if the formatting is off. 

As a little backstory, I work in an office supply store in their printing department. We can do all kinds of things from making indoor banners to simply printing a black and white sheet of paper. Our prices are a little high and we have an express fee for doing a job within the hour. Now, onto the story. 

At this point I had been working at the store for nearly a year now and I knew the ins and outs of the printing department. If you have a question, I know the answer. We were getting ready to close up shop, about twenty minutes before close. At this point, a lot of my machines are turned off and a lot of the jobs dropped off are to be completed the next morning. A woman comes in to pick up her order and I happily give it to her. The job hasn’t been completed by me, but by a fellow coworker. I was just handing it off. 

The woman looks at it, confused. She said it was supposed to be mounted, which is laminating it onto a 24x36 foam board. I check her order ticket and, no. There was no instructions for it to be mounted. So I inform her of such and tell her I’ll do it for her and quote her a price. It was definitely expensive so I offered a cheaper option, she can find a foam board and do it herself. She seemed pleased and walked away when I told her where they were. 

Think that’s the end? Oh no. This isn’t a happy ending. After about two minutes, she approaches the front. I was speaking to my manager about something and she asked where they were a second time. I confirm with my manager and point her in that direction. My mistake for not taking her back to look. When she came back up, she was angry. She got in my face to scream, “it’s not back there!”

I have an anxiety disorder and people yelling at me sends my anxiety in a whirlwind. So I got quiet and squeaked out a “Really?” While my coworker checks her out for her other times. My manager and other coworker were standing there while she screamed at me. At some point, my manager left as he didn’t want to deal. I don’t blame him. 

She was saying things like she understood why we had no customers (remember, it’s about ten minutes before close now) and she’d tell all her friends to never come here as our customer service was awful. My heart was racing and I couldn’t catch my breath. As she left, my coworker sarcastically called to her to have a nice day. As soon as she was gone, I broke. I started blubbering like a baby, hyperventilating and trying to hide my face. 

My coworkers were awesome, trying to calm me and make me laugh. The woman eventually got comped for her order and was happy. I, however, will never forget the way she screamed in my face.",TalesFromRetail,1499,1571417148
Skippyin,"""The doctors have to take my face off because I have skin cancer""","First-time poster on this sub. This event happened this past Tuesday and I've been debating on whether or not this was a good enough story to post. I figured someone might get a kick out of it so: here you go.

I work at a big name crafts store as a cashier. It was around mid-afternoon so we weren't particularly busy. Weekdays tend to be very quiet with the only big rushes coming in around 12 or after 3. This elderly lady with frizzy white hair comes walking up to my counter with her items and a coupon. Okay, standard stuff. This should be an easy sale.

So I start scanning her items and while I do that I try to start up a conversation. I like to do that. I find it helps pass the time for the customer, plus I just love to hear other people's stories. Well boy howdy did this woman have a doozy.

I wasn't able to remember the exact dialogue but I remember that this was so sudden I almost got whiplash. I'll give you guys a rough summary of how it went.

Me: So, how have you been doing?

Old Lady: Awful. I'm 91 years old so my health is going.

Me: Oh i'm very sorry to hear that. but wow 91 years old that's impressive.

OL: The doctors- The doctors have to take my face off.

Me: O-Oh?

OL: I have cancer. They have to remove my skin. I have skin cancer and \[name of some other medical ailment that i can't remember.\]

Me: That's awful I'm very sorry to-

OL: It makes my leg shake in the night and look at my hand \*shows me her hand\* It makes it so hard for me- it shakes. And they always say ""oh you look fine"" and ""oh you look great"" but they're lying I know they are.

Me: I'm very sorry to hear that ma'am-

OL: I've always had cancer. I keep telling my doctors. But they never find anything. They say it's not there. BUT I KNOW i have cancer!

Me: \*starting to realize she could be mentally ill\* Ah. I see.

OL: I had a tumor in my lip once. It took them two years to get it out because they didn't believe me. And I had- I had cancer behind my stomach. And then I had a blocked \[unintelligable\] that they had to go through my whole intensities and give me a bag to help drain it and- \*she keeps going on about her entire medical history\*

Me: Right- that will be-

OL: I recently signed over my house to my grandchildren- and they say- they say I-

Me: Ma'am, that'll be \[Total amount of purchase\]

OL: Oh right \*puts her card in the machine\*

We finish up the transaction and I'm certain now she's going to say her goodbyes. But no. After I hand her the receipt she goes right back to talking.

OL: - anyway I've had to get 58 surgeries. Oh and look at this.

Then from the depths of her purse, she pulled out a ziplock bag with papers inside, pulled out the papers to reveal that they're just random blurry photos of random parts of her body. A couple of photos of her face. A few of her hands. A few of her feet. They all looked normal but she's pointing out these photos as if they're PROOF that she has cancer.

I think she felt emboldened to keep going because nobody else was there. So there I stood. Looking at blurry photos. I didn't want to seem insensitive and tell her to get lost, but I didn't want her to hinder me doing my duties. I also wasn't sure if she was mentally ill or not. I'm a very empathetic person, especially when it comes to cancer patients. My grandpa passed away due to liver cancer and losing him was painful. Even so, I know she might have been doing this out of fear, and just needed an outlet.

I took her hand and told her, ""Well, you were strong enough to make it this far and I pray that you'll at least be able to find some comfort.""

She laughed as if I had said a joke and then turned to walk away because she noticed another customer coming up to the registers.

It was a really strange and kind of uncomfortable encounter. I do hope that woman is ok though, despite coming off as a little bit crazy.",TalesFromRetail,1713,1571328981
wwynterrstorm,I Want To Hand Pick 60 Cupcakes,"Mobile warning. 

This happened 3 weeks back now. 

I recently started a job at a bakery where we have $1 cupcakes on Tuesdays. 

Now, people will order them ahead of time, having us set them aside and bag them. They give a pick up time and name, all is good. Not everyone knows about this, but hey, they are a buck, so they do it next time. 

As you can imagine, everyone comes in and gets dozens. This day though, was a day. 

At the time, we had about 10 people in our small storefront. There are usually 3 of us to help customers, so we do our best. I call to help however is next, and a woman and her daughter walk up. 

The woman starts telling me her life story, but today they are at our bakery to buy 60 cupcakes for a baby shower on the weekend. Okay, no problem. Did you want to get 5 flavors, a dozen each? She struggled with this idea for bit, but finally agreed. This is where it turns. 

She tells me she wants the prettiest cupcakes since it's for a shower. Okay, the best decorated ones, can do. She picks cookies and cream, and I start to fill a dozen. She stops me, and asks me to PULL THE TRAY out of the case and let her INDIVIDUALLY choose each cupcake for each dozen. Her daughter gets embarrassed instantly. I kind of stared at her for a second til she asked again. As if there weren't 7 people behind her wanting cupcakes as well. So there I am, forced to pull the tray out while she picks 12 cupcakes from throughout the whole tray. People around her are kind of staring, and her daughter had tried to say something",TalesFromRetail,1965,1571278295
azisles02,You never know who you meet working,"This story was from 14 years ago back on Long Island &amp; doesn't involve anyone being rude or nasty, so if that's what you came here for, sorry to disappoint.

I was working at my register around Thanksgiving/Christmas time, when a nice older lady came up to my register and we had a brief conversation about how the holidays bring out the best in people (which they do if you don't count the maniacs shopping). Then the topic of how everyone should be thankful for what they have and we should never take a minute later for granted.

She then surprised me with ""I know probably better than anyone the truth of that."" Not sure how many of you know, but the year before (2004) she became famous for being the victim of teenagers throwing frozen turkeys out of there car into oncoming traffic going the other way. It hit her car, broke through the window, bent the steering wheel before hitting and basically destroyed her face (Google it if you think I'm kidding).  Needless to say that I was in shock because she healed to the point you couldn't tell that nearly every bone in her face was shattered, her jaw wired shut and was living off a feeding tube just a year prior. I told her that after hearing the story, I was happy to see how well she recovered.

I then asked her if they ever found the kids who did it. She said she did and she asked the judge to go easy on them as she forgave them. I instantly remember hearing that in the paper and I told her ""You are a much better person than I could ever be, because I don't think I would be as forgiving if that was me."" She appreciated me honesty &amp; understood where I was coming from as I'm sure others have said something similar. Such a sweet lady that I was honored to have met even for just a few minutes.",TalesFromRetail,1580,1571185283
themasterkang,A reunion with the man who threatened to kill me,"I found out about this sub recently, and I have many retail stories to share, so this will mark the first I suppose.

Over the summer, I worked at a drugstore out on Long Island. I bike everywhere, and to get to the store, I had to take one of two major roads. One of the roads was bigger and had a faster speed limit, and it makes me uncomfortable to have so many cars whizzing by me. I normally choose the smaller road, which (in theory) has a slower speed limit, but because the road has less traffic, people go at whatever speed they want because the traffic cops mainly stick to the big road. Another obstacle on this smaller road is that it is very close to the beach, so there will often be large patches of sand on the side of the road, which is especially dangerous for cyclists.

I was biking to work one morning and I had to go a bit into the road to avoid one of the patches of sand, and was surprised when I heard a loud car horn right behind me. A split second later, a red minivan whizzed around me, going well above the speed limit. I was annoyed by their lack of decorum, so I theatrically flipped them off with both arms. To my surprise, the car stopped until I came alongside it. Sitting in the driver’s seat was an older man not wearing a shirt. As I passed him he accelerated, trying to run me off the road, coming alongside me and then swerving towards me, while screaming about how he was going to beat me up and kill me. I ignored him as best I could, dodging his car with little difficulty as there was a small grassy incline that I stayed on top of, and he eventually gave up and drove off. I arrived at work with no further incident. I mainly forgot the details of the incident a while later.

A few days after, I was checking out an older gentleman at the store, and we started a small conversation, and it was very nice. I wished him a nice day, and he left. Over the next few weeks, he came in every couple of days to pick up groceries and the like. Each time, we had a small conversation. One day, our conversation drifted over to the roads and traffic, and he mentioned that he always drives on the road that I bike on. I mention that I always use that road to get to work as well, and then I mention that sometimes drivers can be a bit aggressive on that road, mentioning that I had an incident a couple of weeks ago. As I say this and I’m looking at him, something clicks, and I realize that this man who I’ve enjoyed talking to these last few weeks is the SAME GUY who threatened to kill me all those weeks ago. He realizes the same thing, and we stare at each other in silence for a few moments before his transaction goes through and he abruptly leaves the store. I never saw him again.",TalesFromRetail,744,1571181312
Norbit1223,A customer freaks out over getting popcorn for the right price,"I work as a keyholder at a grocery store. For the most part, the customers that I interact with are rather pleasant or neutral, but every once in a while some sour fuckers come out of the woodwork. 

It's a somewhat busy day and I'm running the front end by myself so I'm being more lenient just so things go more smoothly. I see a light blinking and I go over to investigate. The cashier tells me that there are two bags of popcorn ringing up incorrectly according to the customer. The bags of popcorn were ringing up as I believe $2.00 but were supposed to be 2 for $3.00, or $1.50 each. I remember something very similar happened a couple days ago, so I give the customer the benefit of the doubt and I immediately change the price without even looking through the weekly flyer or looking at the tags of the shelf.

Despite changing the price of something on the spot with no fucking question (something that could possibly come back to me if I was wrong), this lady was STILL not happy.

&gt;""This is the second time something rang up wrong this week. Your store is going completely downhill. I'm going to complain to the manager, post to your Facebook page about this, and contact the Better Business Bureau.""

I had no idea what to do other than just walk away. She paid for her stuff and the last time I saw her she was walking toward customer service asking to see the manager. I didn't hear anything from any manager about this situation. I cannot fathom why the fuck this lady was still mad even though I made the price of her popcorn what she said it was supposed to be; was it because it took me a total of 45 seconds to walk over, listen to the situation, and change the price?",TalesFromRetail,1253,1571149247

Eff_Engine,Vague threat over £0.40,"This story occurred last night.

So I had been put onto the late shift (3pm-11pm) to cover for a shift manager being away to celebrate his birthday, 

The shift was going really well up until this one incident around 8:30. This man and his kid come up to the till to buy some general bits. As I finish scanning everything, he says “Mate, that price isn’t right, I want to see a receipt”. I then inform him that to see a receipt he first needs to pay for the goods. This is around the time I first started to sense something was up.

He then reluctantly paid for his items and grabbed the receipt off of me. He intensely stared at it before saying “Mate that sausage roll ain’t £1.40, the label says a £1”, “I ain’t paying an extra 40p for that”. He then says “I had to check the receipt as this happens all the time here” which it does since we can’t always update a label as soon as a price changes.

He then delivers the line that genuinely struck a bit of fear into me, “Mate I’ve been arrested before over an incident like this”. My brain starts thinking “What on Earth do you mean by that?” so to avoid a potential incident with him, I went over to check the label myself which indeed did say it was £1 so I gave a refund and put it through at the new price. He then went on his merry way, leaving me confused and to be honest, a little bit worried.

Speaking to my shift manager afterwards, he said he saw them down the isle he was tidying up and got weird vibes about them, but weirdly, more about the kid than the dad.",TalesFromRetail,876,1571047521

Fcutdlady,The brazen thief,"My dad and I used to run a homebrew shop here in Dublin Ireland. We knew all our customers as homebrew was a niche buisness, It didn't often attract new trade. Dad was doing some accounting work in the kitchen behind a closed door and I was in the shop, sitting on the chair at the sales desk. A regular customer came in and we were talking for a few minutes. Another man on his own came into the shop and was looking around for a minute. Then he came over to me, had 2 of the most expensive wine kits in his hands, excused himself, and asked  could he push past the other man as he was rushing. The other customer said OK. The guy put the two wine kits on the counter and told me he'd bought them from me a couple of days ago. That rang alarm bells as I didn't recognise him as having been in the shop a few days before, never mind buying anything from me . he added  his wife prefared red wine and he had 2 white wine kits. I offered him an exchange but he wanted a refund. I told him I would have to get my dad as I'm not able to give money back. I went into the kitchen and called dad out. He looked round the shop and smiled at the customer looking for a refund. The customer explained himself again and dad said I'm sorry I can't give refunds without a receipt. The man got very flustered searched his pockets and then he said it might be in his car. He left the shop and left the kits on the counter. Never came back. I asked dad what happened. Dad told me look at the shelf. There were 2 gaps where those wine kits on the counter belonged. My dad was a stickler for keeping the shelves full and had just filled them prior to starting  his accounting work and no customers had come in between dad filling the shelf and the regular customer avd the con man  did. What we knew happened was the guy saw that I was engaged with the regular customer i was talking to and used him as a distraction so he could get the kits off the shelf and bring them over to the sales desk. I hasten to add the regular customer was a customer of ours for some years and well known to both dad and I. He was not a knowing part of the con.

prismashadowboy,Little Girl Gets Caught Stealing,"Okay this happened yesterday and I thought I’d share the story. It’s not too exciting but it’s the first time I witnessed something like this. 

A little background: I work at a crafts store as a cashier. I started about a month ago and have been only working two-three shifts in a week. Near the cash registers are aisles where we keep magazines, bags of candy, and some colorful kids toys (small stuffed animals, squishy toys, keychains, etc). It’s not uncommon for me to see little kids begging their parents for a treat of some kind or coming up to the counter with one. 

So yesterday I am working at the register at Guest Services counter cashing people out. In line comes two mothers who both speak Spanish to each other and to the four little girls they had with them. The little girls were running around and begging their moms to get them some small toys. The moms were very assertive and gave them firm ‘no’s’ the entire time they were being cashed out. I felt kind of bad for the little girls, but I understood why the moms were so insistent on saying no. These two women were spending over $200, mostly on ribbon! Not to mention that these little girls weren’t behaving very well, running around in circles and whining (I understand little kids are impatient and it was after 7:30 so I can imagine everyone was just tired, too). 

I get the two moms checked out, and they gather the little girls, all with pouty faces, to leave. I’m handing one of the moms the $200 worth of items while the other mom gets down to the level of one of the little girls who was standing behind her. This mom noticed before I did that the girl had a hand up her shirt. She gets to her level and pulls her arm out, revealing a squishy unicorn keychain! The mom puts the unicorn on the counter near her and scolds her daughter in Spanish. I don’t know much Spanish, but I recognized the word ‘policia,’ which was enough for me to understand that she was basically telling her daughter that she’d get in trouble with the police if she stole. 

I applaud that mom for catching her daughter because I probably wouldn’t have noticed at all!",TalesFromRetail,2464,1570894547
MooBaaPip,A win-win situation,"During my last hour of work today I was unpacking a pallet with new activity books, board games and some hobby kits for children. I was working close to the till, to ring up the occasional customer. I did it as fast as I could, cause I really wanted to be able to finish before my weekend.


On this pallet was a big rack for displaying the books, and it came in a large cardboard box, that I had cut open in the front and pulled the rack out.


A man and his kid (5ish years maybe) came up to pay. The man had a few things for his job, and the kid had an activity book from last season. The man brought me in to their chat about doing a few of the pages in the book, so I opened it and said ""Oooh, look, bats!""


The kid was a little bit shy, so he escaped the conversation while his dad was paying. I kept my eye on him, as all my stuff made a slightly risky environment, and naturally he did what every kid would do. So when payment was done, I said to the dad: ""Your kid disappeared into that big box. I'm done with it, so if you want a huge box to play with during the weekend, feel free to grab it."" 


And they took it! They were so happy, though the kid was still too shy to thank me. I was equally happy, because I no longer needed to struggle with throwing away the huge box. A win-win, and a nice end to the week.",TalesFromRetail,808,1570828039

customer- C // me- ME

\#1 this customer brings one small tray of beef up to the counter and asks for a plastic bag. I say no sorry we don't have any but we have free boxes or a reusable bag option for $1.

C- SO HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CARRY THIS TO MY CAR???

C then started going on about how we have such bad customer service and that we should be providing plastic bags for free, then just ends up carrying the tray WITH HER HANDS back to the car that was parked 2 meters from our shop. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#2 we have a self serve ""salted brisket"" station thing where you could take a BB and tongs and pick out which pieces you wanted from a large container and have it weighed up at the counter. 

sometimes people bring up their BB full to the brim, hands wet, meat dripping, pay and leave -no complaints at all, sometimes take a box, which is fine but I have customers that take only 1 or 2 pieces and demand an extra bag even tho its obvious that there's no dripping. 

I offer them a free box or a reusable bag for $1 but no. they want a PLASTIC bag. I say no sorry I don't have any (I really don't) the prime minister banned them and we could get fined if we gave out plastic carry bags. 

a customer literally said ""fuck the prime minister"" and I was honestly baffled.

\#3 someone once brought up their BB of brisket and asked for an extra BB which I was told to charge extra 20c for by my boss and so I told the customer that and they got angry and said

C- what??

ME- the extra BB is 20c because you really don't NEED it and we're trying to cut down the use of plastic but we have free boxes or $1 reusable bags if you want

C- NO, I have heaps of boxes and reusable bags at home. they're such a waste of space. I don't want them.  
you know what? I don't want this meat anymore if I have to pay for a BB

and just storms out of the shop. 

I really don't understand the gall of these people. you have heaps of REUSABLE bags and boxes at home but refuse to bring them with you shopping? my parents have a few boxes in the car boot all the time, it shouldn't be that hard to reuse your reusable bags and boxes. if you just leave them to sit at home that just defeats the point of having them.

Amukari,Customer Flips Out that I won't do a return on an Expired Product that a STRANGER bought him,"First time poster on mobile so sorry for an mistakes

A little background: My family owns a small supermarket in an area that is predominantly Hispanic so the main language of most customers and our employees is Spanish. Since I'm the owner's daughter/ store manager and am bilingual the task of dealing with English speaking customers usually falls on to me or my brother if he's also working. The issue with this is while I'm a 23 Female College Student I look very young for my age therefore people mistake me as an lowly 15 year old and rarely given me any respect as a manager so it can be hard to control some customers. This story is such a case

A cashier calls me over because a customer would like to make a return but he does not have a receipt. Now our policy is that no cashier can make any returns without the receipt but since I'm the manager I have the power to override this if I feel there's a real issue with the product or if I recognize the customer and believe that they really did buy it from us.

The man in question was one I did not recognize as a regular in our store and the product in question for a return was a bottle of vegetable oil that had expired 2 YEARS AGO. Now I'm not going to pretend that my store is perfect and we never have any damaged or expired items on shelves that we missed but something that expired 2 years ago? Very unlikely that we would've missed that. 

Either way I asked the man if he had his receipt. He proceeds to tell me that he does not because another man had came into the store and bought it for him. I tell him that I can not do the return without the receipt and if he can ask to see if his friend still had it. He tells me that he can not because he does not know the man. Ummmmmm

He continues saying that a stranger came with his wife and kids and bought the groceries and he cannot ask for the receipt because he does not know him. I then ask him if he could ask his wife if she could get the receipt from this ""stranger"" and he starts to scream about he can't contact the other man because he is a stranger and he does not know him........but he came to the store with his wife and kids. I tell him there is nothing I can do for him and he starts screaming and insulting every part of my being (my appearance, personality and even spirituality) because I'm such a cruel person for not letting him return the 2 year old vegetable oil that a stranger bought for him.",TalesFromRetail,629,1570651127

TheAdults,Had my first rude customer! Lady tells me how she wants her items bagged after I fill up an entire bag,"I've been working as a cashier for about 2 months at a small retail store. I finally had my first angry customer that I knew I was going to get someday.

So today, we were low on bags, and we had to use as few as possible while we waited for the manager to arrive with more. I'm stocking in the general cashier area when a customer pulls up, and I ask her if she's ready to pay. She doesn't respond and just pushes her cart over to the checkout area. I walk over to the register and start scanning her items. Again, we were low on bags, so not wanting to be wasteful, I try and fit as much as I can into each one of them. The lady notices this and just outright says ""Don't put anything else with the ornaments."" I think to myself ""okay, I'll just move this bag aside, continue scanning and bagging the other items, and I'll fix that bag afterwards like she wants it"", since I wanted to make room on the belt for other customers that had showed up. I continue scanning and not even 10 seconds after her request she looks inside her bag and then says ""I just fucking told you not to put anything with the ornaments.""

At this point I get a smile on my face thinking ""oh, it's finally happening."" It would have been nice to know how she wanted her items bagged right before I filled up an entire bag, but I didn't say anything. I tell her that I will fix her bag once I'm done scanning everything, if that's okay. She ignores me and starts taking her items out and fixing them herself, grunting and sighing every 3 seconds, as if she's trying to make me feel bad. I bag everything, give her the total, and she pays. Still having a smile on my face and keeping my cool, I give her the receipt and tell her to have a nice day, and at this point she's honestly starting to look like she's upset for not getting a reaction out of me, so I make sure to continue doing what I'm doing. While moving her items, she dropped one on the counter and proceeds to yell ""Can I get a bag for that?!"" I happily pick up the item and put it into one of her bags. She gives me a terrible look and tells me that it fell while she was fixing the mess I made. I tell her that I'm glad everything is fixed now. She then grunts one last time before turning around and walking out of the store. The other customers looked uncomfortable but there were no further problems. It's not as insane as other stories, but it was my first rude customer that truly looked like they hated me. I don't get offended easily tho so any insults thrown at me affect me zero. I just hope I handled it well.",TalesFromRetail,1250,1570449293
ohkammi,"""I just wanted to call""","This just happened today and had me so confused. Sorry if its not too interesting.

Background: I work in the eCommerce department of a well known retail store. Basically, when people order their groceries off our website, we grab things off the shelf, organize their order, and load it into their car at our designated parking spots. Customers check in through an app or call to let us know they are here. We have a department cellphone that one person dispensing orders keeps on them. I had it at this time.

I was outside finishing up another customer's order when a second car pulls up. I walk over to make sure he's checked in so I can find his order and get it to him. As soon as I walk up to him he raises a finger and hushes me before I can speak. He has out his cellphone and I can already see where this is going.

Me: Sir, I can check you in, theres no need to call since I have the phone anyways.

Customer: Just let me call the number so I can get my groceries!

At this point the phone begins ringing in my pocket and he still has his finger up hushing me. 

Me: Umm, I have the phone so you'd just be talking to me anyways. I just need your name so I can check you in?

I grab the phone and show him his number coming through. I'd also like to mention he's smoking a pipe and just casually blows the smoke in my direction (this is actually infuriatingly common). At this point he's also looking visibly frustrated that no one is answering the phone.

Customer: I just wanted to call! I thought calling was anonymous! (what?) \*more incomprehensible muttering and anger\*. 

At this point I'm just silent waiting for him to hang up so that we could move on from this. He doesn't. He lets it go to voicemail. Looking back, I had the perfect opportunity to just answer and be a smart ass, but, I was too stunned in the moment to really do anything. I wish I could say anything else interesting happened after this but it didn't, a coworker came out with his order after I got his name and I went back inside.",TalesFromRetail,875,1570416334
kaitlyn_dobby,“Just let me in”,"I work in a pretty general retail chain, mostly beach style wear (hello fellow Australian!). 
This morning was interesting...We open at 10am in Sunday’s and I have one other staff member arrive at 930am so we can cash up. 

Before this staff member even makes it in the door I can hear a someone harassing her. I got out to see what’s going on, and essentially a customer is wanting to exchange a faulty item. I go out and this customer is yelling at me already. 

C: These are broken, I have the receipt, I want to swap it for a new pair
Me: I can do that, however it can only be at 10 when we are open
C: it’s just a swap you can do it now
Me: I can’t, the registers aren’t open. We aren’t open 
C: I’m in management, other stores swap before trade

QueenFrankie420,"""I cannot do that, sir. That would be a breach of privacy.""","Obligatory info. I work as a department lead in a retail store that sells everything from home goods to apparel to groceries.

We have a desk area on the sales floor that has a computer and a few other things there. The amount of people who think it's a register is kind of astounding, but that's not really the point of this story even though that's how it began. I was standing at this computer with my scanner looking up stuff in our system to update out of stocks in my department when a man came up.

Me - ""Hello, can I help you with anything today?""

Him - ""yes, I'd like to check out""

Me - ""oh, I'm sorry, this isn't a register but there's one just over this way."" I indicate the direction of the nearest register.

Him - ""oh, ok, you know, my kid works here.""

Me - ""That's nice, it's a good job, I've been here a while. Who is that? I might know them.""

Him - ""(name I don't know)""

Me - ""I don't know that person, but I'll keep an eye out for them and say hi if I see them.""

Him - ""you know, *kid* lives with me. I can't remember their phone number for their card, can you look it up?"" He indicates the computer I'm at.

Me - ""I'm sorry, I don't have access to other employees phone numbers and that isn't something we would be allowed to give to a customer even if I did.""

Him - ""why not? They are my kid.""

Me - ""I cannot confirm that in any way.""

Him - ""I have id"" he starts to pull out his wallet.

Me - ""I'm sorry, but I still wouldn't be able to confirm that *name* is your child. Are they working today? You could find them and...""

Him - (interrupting) ""no, don't you think I would have done that already?""

Me - ""I'm sorry.""

Him - ""I want to talk to a manager.""

Me - ""I am the acting manager on shift today.""

Him - ""I want a reeeaaaaallll manager"" (yes, he said it like that)

Me - ""The manager of my department is not in the store at the moment, I can call.....""

Him - (interrupting) ""you are not a manager"" (points at my name tag) ""your tag does not say manager. I want (kid)'s phone number NOW!""

Me - ""I'm sorry but I cannot do that, sir. It would be a breach of privacy. I can call...""

Him - (interrupting) ""I'm (kid)'s FAAAATTTTHHHHEEERRRRR!!! I WANT THE NUMBER!!!!""

I just pulled out my phone and called another department's manager over while he was yelling this at me.

Him - ""DON'T IGNORE ME! GET OFF THE PHONE!""

Me into phone - ""hi (name) it's queenfrankie420 in (department). I have a customer over here at (location) and he's asking to speak to a manager. (My manager) is on lunch and not in the store right now, could you possibly come over?""

He's screaming at me the entire time and the other person says ""what in the world? I can hear him over HERE without the phone.... I'll be right there.""

Me into phone - ""thanks"" to customer ""(name) is on their way over to talk to you.""

Him - ""WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO YOUR JOB AND GIVE ME THE GD PHONE NUMBER????""

I ignored the question - ""(name) will be here in a moment to address that issue.""

He kept yelling at me and I repeated that line twice before the manager finally got there.

I don't know exactly what happened after that because they walked away together and I stayed there to complete my job.",TalesFromRetail,1336,1570300993
InfiniteDownload,I WANT IT ON MY CARD— Oh wait.,"As a cashier I process several refunds a day. I’ll generally get some sketchy ones and some normal ones. There was one I processed fairly recently that was beyond sketchy. Let me explain something first though.

The company I work for processes returns by scanning a barcode that comes printed on the bottom of EVERY receipt. We scan the barcode, then the item (if it matches up with the receipt) and input the return price of said item. After the return is finished, you may purchase other items in exchange or get the negative amount back in whatever way you paid with (except checks— that’s another story). 

Now this is what’s REALLY confusing. If you return an item at a different store in exchange for another item at that same store but you go to an entirely different store to return that exchanged item, you’re stacking returns. The money coming back on that second return will go on a gift card instead of what you paid with in the first exchange. Why the registers do it this way, I’ll never know. If you know, please enlighten me. 

Anyway I had a guy give me a receipt from another store with a returned wheelchair on the top for $149.99. In exchange for this wheelchair, he bought a walker worth $129.99. Mind you this exchange took place at an entirely different store.

So he wanted to return the walker he just bought in an exchange. I said “okay” and processed it. As I mentioned earlier, whenever items are double stacked like this in a return, the difference will go back on a gift card. He went into a hissy fit saying:

 “Oh my wife will kill me if I bring back a gift card. Can’t you just give me cash or just put the difference back on my debit card?”

I sighed and told him: “No sir we can’t. The way these transactions are set up, whenever returns are double stacked like this, the register forces us to put the difference back on a gift card regardless of what you used to pay before.”

He pulled the classic line: “Let me speak to your manager!”

I called a manager over and they were dumbfounded. They’d never heard of “stacked returns” before and tried voiding the whole transaction. The manager processed the entire thing the same way I did and didn’t understand why the register did what it did. 

This guy kept insisting we just put the difference back on his card. We kept saying no and he was getting angrier and sweatier. As soon as the manager mentioned that he could use the gift card at any of our other branches, he went:

“Oh I can? Cool! That works out then!”

He then walks away with gift card in hand and acting satisfied.

I’m sorry WHAT? 

A manager mentions something that should probably be common knowledge based on how much he “shops here”. The only thing that can satisfy him is a managers decision?

I wanted to punch a wall after that encounter.",TalesFromRetail,957,1570289185
Calarine,"""Where do you go to pick up online orders?""","This is my first post but I felt this story was interesting enough to be shared. So I work at a grocery store, and I stand at the door all day which means I answer the questions of every customer coming in with one. This couple came in and asked me a very simple question, ""Where do you go to pick up online orders?""

Now, the self checkout is in front of my door but to the right a little; if you look straight ahead you'll see all the way to the other side of the store to a set of doors leading to the back. If you look straight ahead and to the up a little, you'll see a sign saying ""Pickup ➡.""

So, naturally, I pointed to the sign. ""Pickup is that way.""

The customer looked ahead, but not up. ""So... We go to the back of the store?""

""No, see the sign? Right there?""

""Are you saying we go to the back to pick up online orders?""

""No, no,"" At this point I had realized they hadn't and were not going to see the sign, so I pointed in the same direction it was pointing. ""Pickup is over there.""

I have forgotten their exact words by now, this was a few months ago, but the couple kept on asking if it was in the back and not really listening to me, until they decided to go ask another employee by self checkout for clarification.
I could hear them say that I ""don't know where pickup is"" and ""as an employee she should know where it is.""

As soon as they were gone, my coworker came up to me and was like ""You know, pickup is--""

""I know where pickup is. I was pointing at the sign there,"" I pointed at the sign, ""and when they still didn't understand I pointed that way,"" I pointed to the right, ""but they would not listen to me.""

And that was that.

Except it wasn't.

So then I get another coworker a few minutes later trying to tell me where the pickup is, amd I have that exact conversation, again.

And again. Except when the third coworker came up to me, as I was explaining to her that the customers weren't listening to me, one of the customers came up and apologized to me because she ""wasn't aware it was my first day."" I'd been there for a week. Anyway, after that people stopped bothering me about pickup.

The worst part of it is that pickup is right along the wall. You walk in, turn right and there it is. You can't miss it.",TalesFromRetail,632,1570264983
mangoandpassionfruit,"""Are you calling my son a liar?!""","Obligatory 'on mobile, first time posting', etc

So I work in a store that sells video games and accessories, and our returns policy is that if something is still sealed, we'll return it within thirty days. If it's unsealed and after thirty days, we can only return the item if there is a fault with it.

A woman comes in today with one of our own-brand headsets, saying that she bought it a couple of weeks ago and her son doesn't think that the sound quality is very good. My co-worker, we'll call her Jenny, politely tells this woman that we cannot return the headset unless there is an actual fault. Store policy. The customer, a Karen, then tells Jenny that ""there is a fault! The sound quality isn't good! It's crackly!""

Our own-brand headsets aren't great, I will admit that, but with headsets you often get what you pay for.

Jenny goes out back and tests this headset, as we do with all ""faulty"" items, and when she comes back and tells Karen that the headset sounds fine and that we can't return it, as expected, Karen does not like this.

She goes on to ask whether she can have her money back on a gift card, Jenny says no, company policy states that we cannot return an item unless it is faulty. Karen then accuses Jenny of calling her son a liar, refusing to entertain the idea that there might be a problem elsewhere with her son's console, i.e. his controller, his connection, etc. Jenny is calm during this, being polite and respectful, but Karen is having none of it. ""You're just calling my son a liar! Why would you call a fourteen-year-old a liar?""

Then my boss steps in; he (thank god) backs Jenny up, tells Karen the same thing Jenny told her, even when Karen brings out the ""so you'd rather lose a customer?"" card.

I don't really know how to finish this lol, but Karen eventually left, without her refund, after accusing us of taking advantage of children.

LannaBeans,Our monthly customer at the supplement store.,"I thought about this story not long ago and really wanted to share a more wholesome retail story.

I used to work at a small supplement store back when I first started college. We sold your usual vitamins and supplements as well as protein powders, workout supplements, essential oils, medicine, that kind of stuff.

We had this regular customer, let’s call him Albert, who came into the store about once a week. He was an older, retired gentleman whose wife was kind of sickly. He’d come every single month, around the same time, with a little red paper folder filled with pictures of the exact vitamins and medicines he needed to get for her. He’d show me a picture, we’d walk to where it was together, and do that about 3 more times, then he’d pay, leave a little peppermint candy for every person working that day, and leave. Then we’d see him again next month just like clockwork. He liked to tell the staff stories about all the places him and his wife have visited (he had no kids so him and his wife traveled the world for quite a few years). I loved this customer, everything he did was just adorable. And we knew whenever Albert was gonna grace us with his presence because this adorable, tiny old man drove a sweet red Ferrari. Bless you, sir. We all need an Albert in our retail careers.",TalesFromRetail,1429,1570104655
Kacke0525,Woman doesn't understand how check lane dividers work.,"I had finished with the people in front of this Weird Woman by the time she was ready to place her items on the belt.  
Despite me having a line, she walked nearly all the way up to my register before starting to empty her cart. (Which means if the person behind her, like 97% of customers, is dumb enough to not understand how a moving belt works, then I'm going to end up getting their groceries mixed in with Weirdo's groceries. *thankfully this doesn't happen*) She apparently fully expected someone else to put their items on the belt, too! She had maybe 2 items on the belt and then put a divider behind her items.

I start scanning, and like the belt does, everything moves forward. I grab the divider and place it back in it's notch and continue scanning.  
Weirdo still has ~10 items in her cart when she grabs another divider, places it on the belt and then places items behind it.  
So, I hit ""total"" and tell her: ""okay, so the first total is $23.67.""  
Weirdo snaps: ""What are you talking about? It's all together!""  
Me: ""Oh, then why did you place the divider on the belt?""  
Weirdo snaps: ""It was a **mistake**!""

*sheesh lady, I'm not the one using things incorrectly*  

During the brief ""convo"" I finished scanning the rest of her items and gave her the full total. She paid without a fuss, but seemed to be radiating anger all the way up to her leaving.

TL;DR: Woman intentionally places check lane divider on the belt, then snaps at me when I ask if she's paying for two separate orders.",TalesFromRetail,1367,1569983339
Ehkoe,You’re not my servant,"First post here - an older story from when I was a bagger at a grocery store. Dialogue is approximate at best.

It’s customary for the baggers at my store to ask people wih larger orders if they need help bringing their purchases to their cars. Generally you’d ask as you finish bagging the order, after the cashier has finished taking payment so there’s no interrupting going on.

Well, one day I was bagging a large order and was waiting for my turn to speak. The customer (let’s say Sally) was actively chatting with the cashier, so I wasn’t keen on interrupting. Then without missing a beat, Sally turns to look at me. She uses the flattest, least friendly voice possible when speaking to me, a far cry from how she addressed the cashier.

Sally: “You’re going to help me out, *right*?”
Me: “Of course.”
Sally: “That’s what I tought.”

I was a bit taken aback, but it was hardly the worst I had dealt with. Until I start to follow her out with the cart of groceries. You see, our front end is very busy during prime time and there’s only enough room for two people side by side. So in the interest of not blocking opposite traffic, people walk single file. We didn’t even make it 10 steps before Sally stops, turns around, and gives me a stink eye.

Sally: “Don’t walk behind me. You’re not my servant!”
Me: “Sorry, miss. I’m just following you.”
Sally: “Well don’t stand right behind me.”
Me: “Ma’am, there’s no room to walk anywhere else but behind you.”

She seemed satisfied with that answer and kept walking. Once we got to her car, she made it abundantly clear that I was to place the bags in a very specific manner in her trunk. She would roll her eyes every time I went to place a bag and then tell me to move it to a different area of the trunk. By the time I had loaded all of the bags, I was mentally drained. She closed her trunk and got into her car without saying a word of thanks and sped off as soon as I was out of the way.

I never saw her in the store again and I can’t say that I’m disappointed.",TalesFromRetail,1335,1569941766
BrogerBramjet,Your pocket is moving.,"So we need this one. I used to work the service counter at a trucking company. One day, a driver comes in to drop off his truck. Dude is HUGE. Not fat, muscles. Like if the truck broke down, the load would be on time anyways. He had to turn sideways to go through the door.

I'm setting up his appointment and he's got a foot long sandwich in his hand, which he's eating as we're talking. Politely, but eating. At one point, he's got a few questions to answer so the sandwich is stationary. His shirt pocket started to move. Out pops the fluffiest Pomeranian I've ever seen. Pup's trying to get the sandwich but there just isn't enough of him to reach. Guy noticed me watching and looked down. ""Awwww. Want some, Cujo?"" and tears a chunk off. Dog takes it and retreats into the pocket.

I mean, who calls a Pom ""Cujo""?  Guy apologizes that he brought the pup in. I inform him our rule is pets can be brought in if they are under control. Clearly, he is, so he's welcome. 

Driver went to the office and came back later as we're finishing his truck. Cujo got taken out to meet me and he's sniffing around my counter.  My supervisor comes out, first seeing this giant taking up both our waiting chairs. The he sees Cujo. ""What the...?""  Arf! Arf! My supervisor said it explained the dog hair in the cupholder.

srubia2007,Screen Protector Did Its Job!,"I work at a cell phone retail store. Someone came in and complained that they purchased a tempered glass screen protector (the kind with a lifetime manufacturer guarantee) and it CRACKED when she dropped it, so she wanted her money back. 

After multiple times of trying to explain to the customer that this is the PURPOSE of glass screen protectors (seeing as her actually SCREEN wasn’t broken), I tried a different tactic and suggest she do a warranty claim with the manufacturer,  but I get cut off multiple times and she says she will just “sit there until [she] gets [her] money back,” to which I’m like “that’s fine but we close in an hour, so I’d have to kick you out then.” 

After multiple times back and forth, I finally got out that I can’t return a broken screen protector, but if she gets it replaced by the manufacturer then I can take THAT one back, and she was like “why didn’t you tell me that to begin with?”

matawatamakala,ITS MY WATER! WHY I PAY???,"People have this annoying habit of putting items on the belt at my store that they really shouldn't.

Usually cause I'm the snarky ankle biter I am, I make a joke asking them if they want to buy the item again, which usually gets them to realize their mistake and quickly pick up whatever they put on my belt.

Now, this is where that situation when horrible confusingly wrong. I work in a metropolitan area and my store sees a ridiculous amount of traffic on any given day. Most of my customers are foreigners and as such can usually only speak broken English when they can speak it at all.

MilliumGlynn,Spoiled old people can't read,"I don't post on reddit much but this lady pissed me off and I need to vent.

So I work at a grocery store that's notorious for poorly worded sale signs. It's pretty common that I have to over explain sale specifications to customers and typically apologize for how complex simple stuff is.

Specifically, I work in the bakery, and we had a sale for some of our breads; buy two and get them for $3.50 each. 

I get a call from a register up front telling me that a woman has a couple of our instore breads, and she says they're on sale but they're ringing up regular price. I tell her they are and sale and ask if she has two different kinds, which she says yes. I grab one of the kinds she has (the multigrain one, the other was buttercrust) and run up the the front of the store with the bread. We scan two of the multigrain and it shows up on sale. As a result we assume that the sale is only for two of the same kind.

The woman gets upset and says she didn't think running in for some bread would be so damn difficult. I agree and apologize, and the two of us call over our supervisor who rings her in for the deal on her two different breads, giving her the sale regardless.

I go back to my department and check the sign again. The woman comes up behind me and points to the sign, emphasizing that she's right and I'm wrong. I dunno why she came back since she got her way, but again I apologize, telling her that sometimes the signs are worded badly. She tells me I should fix that, but since it's a chain store we get the designs from head office outside the store, so I tell her I can't change it.

""Yeah, it seems problem solving skills are hard to come by at this store.""

She walks off, and I'm pissed. I now read the sign again, PROPERLY now that I don't have a Karen breathing down my neck, and read that the sale is only for our grain bread, so the buttercrust wasn't part of the deal.

I figured I'd chase after her and let her know, just in case she came back. I honestly did want to be nice about it and save her the trouble next time she came in. I call after her as she makes her way to the exit.

The bitch fucking ignores me. So, being the kind person I am, I just yell out (at the front where all the customers are paying) ""Ma'am the sale didn't work because the buttercrust wasn't listed, have a good night!""

She just walks out faster, I hope out of embarrassment.

I wish she was a one time offender, but everytime she comes by bakery there's always something for her to roll her eyes at. It's great.",TalesFromRetail,1074,1569703617
N0_Tr3bbl3,To the burglar who fed our office cat: thanks.,"I manage a small furniture store in a formerly upscale area. The owner has been getting on to me for the last few weeks about randomly leaving a light on at night when I leave. 

He and I are the only people who have keys to the building as far as either of us know. Our landlord doesn't have a key.

I honestly don't think I have been doing it. I am very careful about turning everything off, especially once I've already been confronted by my boss about it. The last time this happened was Tuesday. I had the day off and one of my employees called saying the owner was complaining about the lights again. 

With him now complaining to other people, I have been extra careful about turning *everything* off at night. Double and triple checking before I leave with flashlight in hand. I'm not the one leaving lights on.

I needed to be in early this morning to meet a truck driver and I beat the owner in. As soon as I unlocked the door I noticed that the lights were on. 

Nothing has been stolen. The store cash is still exactly the same as it was last night when I left, the cokes in the refrigerator are still there. My custom shop Kramer guitar is still hanging on the wall where I leave it. (My job is really boring.)

The *ONLY* thing that was different other than my office light being left on was a half eaten pile of cat food left in front of our building where we don't normally feed the office cats. 

I have called every employee, our landlord, the maintenance man, and the owner's wife to make sure none of them borrowed a key and came in while we were closed. They all deny knowing anything about it. I trust them, but *somebody* is doing it.

Neither my boss or I really care. Whoever it is that's coming in at night to sleep on our mattresses isn't actually stealing anything other than my enjoyment of feeding the cats in the mornings. We just want them to turn out the lights when they leave.",TalesFromRetail,2211,1569602083
bobafett8192,My Biggest Pet Peeve,"So I'm back with another story from cell phone land. This one is a bit shorter than normal but I felt like I needed to post it to help calm down. 


The first thing this lady does when she walks into the store is simply say ""read the notes on my account"" in as bitchy of a tone as you can have. That's not going to help you any lady. I ask for her ID. Of course she left it in her car.


Once she came back with her ID I opened her account to look at the notes. All they said was that she wanted to return some phones. Cool, you could have just said that. I asked her to explain the situation as there was obviously something else going on. She once again says just read the notes. I tell her they all it says is that she wants to return some phones.


Before I ever start a return I explain that there's a restocking fee per phone. I was going to also let her know that customer service had already credited her account for the restocking fees, which happens all the time. Before I can say that she puts her hand in my face and tells me ""you can be quiet now"".

Hands in my face just sets me off. I tried to hold it together but not before telling her she can not do that and just leave if she's going to ask that way. I turned around and walked off to let my manager know I was going to that back before I did something to lose my job.

The arm had snapped off of her glasses, and she wanted to know if I could put her lenses in a new frame. This isn't an uncommon request in itself. They didnt come from our shop originally, so I explain that the lens has to be a very close match to the new frame and it can be hard to find that because suppliers like to use different patterns so you have to go back to the original shop. I'm still happy to see if I can find her one though. 

I go over and start seeing if theres one I can make work. This is like hunting a needle in a haystack, and there are usually only one or two frames at most that will work. Basically you have to take what you can get, and its rarely the ideal color or style.

Her original frame is a narrow rectangle. The lens size is 52 mm wide, and maybe 32 mm tall at most. Most optical frames have the width stamped on the inside, so she sees a 52 on the inside of hers. 

She pulls down this massive cat eye frame. Its in the 45mm tall range. Her lens is a skinny rectangle. This is a tall trapazoid. 

""This says 52 on the inside. Mine say 52 on the inside. They're the same size. I want these.""

I'm dumbfounded, but try to be as polite as I can. I reply ""Ma'am, I'm sorry, but 52 is the width of the lens. While these two have the same width, they dont have the same height. Your lens is way too small for this frame. We'll have to go with a shorter one thats closer to a rectangle."" 

This was not acceptable.

She reiterates ""This says 52. Mine is 52. They ARE the same size. 52 and 52 are the SAME NUMBER."" 

""Ma'am, I understand that. But 52 is the width. These lenses are not even close to the same shape."" I even hold her lens up to the taller one to show her. ""I have no way to stretch your lens. Thats not something that can be done. We have to find one closer to the same height and shape."" 

""But they both say 52. What don't you understand about that?! 52 and 52 are the SAME! Its the same size! Why can't you seem to understand that!"" She says this like I'm a moron who probably can't even count to 52.

This lady seemed to think she'd found some archaic knowledge by matching these two numbers, like it was a shoe size. If it matches, it works. 

After about ten minutes of back and forth with two coworkers backing me up, she just refused to believe me and left in a huff. I like to imagine she struggled with fitting the square block through the circular hole as a child.",TalesFromRetail,1956,1569495932
LongLiveMisanthrope,"The ""Broken"" Lawn Mower","Welcome back to Tales From Returns! Where I worked, we had options that they wanted us to use instead of normal returns. Such as Repair options. Example being, if someone bought a staple gun and it wouldn't run when we test it, we can give them a loaner and take the item in for repairs as long as it is within a certain time frame of the purchase. 

Most customers didn't like this option, for many reasons but the main one is that they couldn't get free items that way. This was super common and I think in the year and a half that I worked returns, only 1 person took me up on the repair option. The rest went with either, ""just give me my cash back"" or the ever classic, ""I want a new one of the same thing"". The first was easy to do, the second required a manager approval, even with a receipt, and they would try to talk them into doing the repair option, but that never worked.

Anyway, I had one customer though that knew of our repair policies and did he best to get around it and get a new mower each year. Since he would return the mower before the end of the applicable return policy, he would talk the managers into giving him a new mower for free each year, even before he got me the first time around. I still don't know how this a good business policy, if he is essentially stealing from us and never paying, but they told me to do it anyway. So I did.

But the following year, I was a little wiser to his and others schemes and had gotten good at talking customers either in circles or fixing the problem so they couldn't complain. \*note: most customers were decent and well meaning people, but there are the select few that try to rig the system\*

So the man walks in with his mower, or what I think is a mower as it is so bogged down with dead and dried up grass I can barely see the red paint underneath. He does his normal, ""I was mowing with it and it just stopped, I want a new one."" I offer him the repair option but he doesn't want to hear about it. So I go, ""Well, sir, I do have to inspect it first before I can return it, do you mind if I take it outside while I do that?"" He is confused but let's me do so.

I have repaired my old mower so many times at home now that I could pretty much be a mechanic for them somewhere, but this one was a different case. After cleaning it, I check the sparks, normal problem starter, they are good, practically pristine. I check power connections, they good. Motor, good and well oiled. Start up components, nice and well tuned. I can't figure it out. Until I pop the gas cap. Damn thing is bone dry. I rolled my eyes.

I come back in after roughly 10 minutes of checking and he goes ""can I just get a replacement mower for it now?""  But me being wise to him make an offer. ""Sir, I bet I can get it started in a minute. If I can, will you take it back?"" ""Uh, I mean, I guess, but what..?"" I don't let him finish as I pull a plastic gas carton out from behind my desk (one we use for filling up replacements) and put a little in the tank. Prime the motor and BAM! Its up and running like new again. 

""Here you go, sir! Its seems to be running just fine now. Can I help you with anything else today?"" He just stared at it dumbfounded for a couple of seconds before quietly wheeling it back out to his truck. To this day I wondered if he never thought I would try to refuel it first?",TalesFromRetail,1120,1569429641
ikillsouls,Customer wants to stick his head in the baler,"I work at a big office supply store, usually on the floor doing logistics and stock but this particular day two cashiers called in and I was stuck at the front register for the day. This was on a particularly busy day, I had 4 customers in line, and the person who was my back up was busy helping a customer with a printer. I have two customers left in line when the mail guy comes, I'm about to go to sign off for a couple packages he leaves but he stops me and says ""these don't need signing, I can tell you're busy"" and walks out.

A few minutes later a middle aged couple walks into the store, looks down at the packages left by the mail man and kicks them... twice.... 

Me: oh, hi can I help you find something? 

Lady: yes, we want boxes like these. For mailing smaller things

Me: of course! Those are in aisle 15!

Lady: oh! You have them for customers? Like just to take? 

Me: ... we sell them if that's what you mean, you take them when you pay for them. 

Husband: oh,  well what about boxes you get things delivered in? Do you not give them to customers when you empty them out? Could you maybe empty these out and we can have the boxes? Or the boxes that you get stock delivered in.

Me: sorry, unfortunately it has to be my manager to open the mail, and he's busy right now. And we don't get stock delivered in cardboard boxes, we get them in plastic bins that we send back and reuse. When we do get cardboard boxes, we put them right in the baler so they dont take up space in our receiving area.

Husband: that's ridiculous,  can I go back there and take a look at the baler? In case they haven't crushed them today

Me: ... you want to go in our receiving area? 

Husband: yes, I want to see if you have boxes back there! 

Me: I'm sorry sir, I cant let you back there for multiple legal reasons, but as I mentioned, we have boxes that size for about two dollars in aisle 15. 

Husband: okay fine, we'll go take a look. 
They walk away muttering about how little help I am and how ""it's a frickin box, why cant they just give it away, why do we have to pay for a box.""

About five minutes later the husband come back up front on his own, when he thinks I'm not looking he goes around the register that's furthest from mine and starts looking at a box that we use to hold recyclable ink cartridges. 

Me: sir, I can not have you looking around back here and especially not touching ink cartridges that could explode on you. 

As I'm saying this this, I look to the back of the store and see that the wife is sticking her head through the doors that lead to the receiving area. It was like telling kids to not do something only to have them go and try to do that exact thing. So at this point I grab my mic and talk loudly into it, enough for the husband and customers in line to hear it: 

*I have two customers going into employees only areas, after I already asked them not to. One is up front behind the register and another is in the back, near receiving* 

The husband turned bright red and shuffled out from behind the register to collect his wife from the back of the store. They both stormed out of the store, but not before trying to grab boxes that we have at the entrance for customers that come in to recycle old printers and other such things. They gave up when they realized the boxes are glued to eachother, and walked out of the store like scorned puppies.",TalesFromRetail,1872,1569345547
starfire221,"No ma'am, other retailers can't see our stock. Go ahead, you can call corporate.","I started working at a large electronics retailer recently and I've enjoyed being able to pass off any customer I don't want to deal with to my boss while I'm training. Today, I got to sit back and watch while they interacted.

The lady comes in, already looking somewhat cross, carrying an old Dell Inspiron from around 2012 or so, and starts demanding to see our batteries. I told her that I don't believe we carry those in store, but I'd be happy to help her order one online. She immediately started yelling at me, telling me that we did have it, and demanding to see a manager. He was standing right behind me, talking with the tech support team for a client's computer repair. He puts them on hold and tells her the same thing I just said, and asks where she saw we had it.

Apparently, an employee at another electronics retailer told her we had one. Not another location of the same chain, but a completely different store. My manager tried to explain that we don't carry any sort of laptop batteries in store, much less for such an old model, when she starts going off on him for being rude and ""chit chatting on the phone"". She takes his picture and says she's going to call corporate for his rude behavior, and asks to see the manager again, I guess not believing he was the manager. Then she demands his name and employee ID. He gives her his name, but refuses to give her his employee ID (which we use to access all sorts of private information), so she goes off on him again about how we are giving poor customer service and it's public information, before storming out of the store, yelling how she's going to get him fired.

drowningparade,"""You should find another job""","It's been a few weeks since this happened, but I'm over it. I work at a grocery store with online pickups where people pick their groceries up for **FREE**. No charges at all.

Well, on this fateful day, I was working the closing shift. We were horribly understaffed so I was working alone. We still have a few orders that haven't been picked yet for 8 to 10 and it was already 7pm when 3 customers came in at the same time. We have a first come, first serve basis so whoever calls our department for pickup first, gets their order first. It usually takes 3 - 10 minutes to load each customer (unless the system goes down and we have to manually scan each and every item which takes forever).  I also tell customers when there are people ahead of them so they know when they're gonna expect a few minutes of wait.

So, I start loading these 3 customers in order. Lady 1 was thankful for me loading her groceries into her trunk without having to get out. No problems at all. Mind you, it only took me 4 minutes to load her. Now I start loading Lady 2's groceries. I got to her car and she comes out. You can immediately see that she was in a bad mood. No worries, we all have our days, right?

**Lady 2**: ""Why did it take you so long to load my groceries?""

**Me**: ""I apologize, but I cannot get to everyone immediately. Lady 1 called first so she got her groceries first. Plus, I'm working alone right now"".

**Lady 2**: *sighs* ""Alright. Just load mine quick. I have to tuck my kids in soon.""

Reasonable enough. Let's say it took me between 7-10 minutes loading hers since it was a huge load. She thanked me and drove off. Now, I start loading Lady 3's order. She also had a huge order so it took me a couple of minutes to get to her. As I get her order out of our department's door, I see her stomping towards me. She was angry. I know she was, but I really wasn't expecting it. I was tired. I've been working since 12:00pm and I had to rush my lunch and not take any 15 minute breaks (atleast until the end of my shift where everything slows down). I wasn't able to say anything back until she took a deep breath after a few minutes of her rant.

**Lady 3**: *insert really long rant about how long her wait is, how she has chores to do still, and that we should compensate her for her time.*

**Me**: ""Miss, I'm really sorry about the long wait. I had to load to customers ahead of you and I'm currently alone-""

**Lady 3**: ""Well, maybe you should schedule more people then!""

**Me**: ""I can't do that, miss. I'm not the department manager, and I don't decide who works when.""

**Lady 3**: ""I don't care! I'm expecting a full refund for this. You and your department are incapable of accommodating your customer's needs!""

A full refund of 600$ worth of groceries with no pickup fees? For 15 minutes of her time?

**Me**: ""I can't issue you a full refund. I can get you a 10$ voucher for the inconvenience, but a full refund is impossible. And as I said earlier, I was working alone.""

**Lady 3**: ""You should find another job if you can't load all of us under 5 minutes. And if you won't issue the full refund, I'll take this to the head manager and I'm getting you fired!""

I just stood there, shocked. I wasn't able to respond at all.

**Lady 3**: ""Now put all my groceries into the back of the car. You've wasted too much of my time already! I hope they fire you.""

She went back into her car, and I just loaded her as fast as I could, cause I just don't wanna deal with this anymore. After she drove off, I sent an email to our department manager regarding this and they sent her a 25$ voucher cause ""customers are always right"".

Maybe I should really find another job...",TalesFromRetail,1328,1569109673

SpitefulMercy,“I Thought It Was A Fancy Humidifier!”,"So I work at an older women’s clothing store, and as many clothing stores do, we have an industrial steamer to get the wrinkles out of new products so they look presentable. We also have to steam the products next to the registers because we don’t have enough staff to be prepping things in the back. 

If you’ve never used a steamer before, they get insanely hot. You can very easily burn yourself if you’re not careful, even just putting it five inches away from your skin long enough can give you a nice red mark. 

Now onto the story, a younger girl and her friend were browsing products near our registers while I was steaming some shirts to be put out. I noticed one of the shirts was missing a sensor, so I turned to grab a set, and while I was walking the five steps back I noticed the girls making a beeline for the steamer.

I swear it was almost a slow motion moment, my brain couldn’t register fast enough that the girl was reaching to GRAB onto the steamers head! She held onto it for around 2 seconds before she yelped and jumped back, “Oh my god it’s hot!”

I stood there in disbelief for a second that this girl literally just decided to grab a steamer. “Are you okay?!” I said, still dumbstruck. 

“Yeah I’m fine, I just thought it was a fancy humidifier!” The girl and her friend turned to leave, laughing at what she just did the whole way out. 

Thankfully she was fine, but I still don’t know why she thought a store would have a humidifier, nonetheless reach to grab the source of the steam! Ever since I’ve been super anxious when people even get close to it when it’s on.",TalesFromRetail,1602,1569002081

duhmeetri,Cop tries breaking Georgia law in liquor store,"So, I work at a small liquor store in Georgia. One day an older man (looks about in his 50s) along with a young girl that might be 18 at oldest. The guy brings 2 bottles of RTD drinks up to the counter and the girl brings a 6 pack of wine coolers. Obviously since Georgia law requires anyone who physically brings alcohol up to the counter with the intent of it being purchased in any fashion, I have to check her ID. So, I ask for the ID.

Guy: No, she's not buying it.

Me: Well she brought it to the register so, by law I have to see her ID and confirm she's 21.

Guy: This is my daughter and the beer is for my wife.

The guy then pulls out a police badge and places it on the counter. I pause in disbelief. I think ""Is this guy really trying to do this?"" So, we then go back and fourth about how the beer cannot be purchased and he even tries the old ""what if she goes wait in the car or if she puts the beer back and I bring it to the register""

Me: It's like this: You being an officer of the law should know what the laws are. The fact you're putting me in this position is pretty inconsiderate. And, I cannot in any way sell you this 6 pack.

Well, eventually he concedes. It was never really a major argument. Wish I could say some more crazy stuff happened, but no. There is this one little bit of info though: I later found out the officer was of top rank of a neighboring city. Not gonna get into any specifics other than that. But I mean, maybe he was getting it for his wife like he said, but I still just can't sell it to him.

MassiveDepartment,Woman shakes the bottom of ladder I'm standing on.," I work at a large retail chain, where most of our stock that has been unboxed and unwrapped that is ready to go on the floor gets placed into overhead bins above the racks and inside the walls, usually covered and disguised by posters. This is so when stock runs low, we can very quickly replenish it. 

I hate heights, but as a result, a huge part of my job is climbing up ladders to replenish stock. Last week we were out of stock of (item), and it just happened to be on the highest shelf of the excess stock, so I had to use the tallest ladder, which is about 2m (?), or 6.5 foot. Basically, the height of an impressively tall man from lowest to highest usable step. Again, I really do not like heights. I understand to a lot of people, this may not seem very high, but I am always extremely stressed doing this, and my biggest fear has *always* been, since I started this position, some dumb karen coming over and knocking me over. 

Last week, my head inside the shelf, standing on top of the ladder, I feel someone at the bottom pushing and pulling. I instantly pull my head out of the shelf, clutching the item, and grasp onto the handle at the top of the ladder. I can literally hear my heart beating inside my head. I look down, gasping for air, and its some dumb youngish woman, about 23-24, smiling up at me, completely oblivious to how fucked up of a thing that is to do to someone. 

""hehe! just checking it's sturdy! nice work!""

I was really shocked bc to see someone around my age being such a karen threw me off, but it was the fact she was so oblivious to why shaking a 2m ladder someone was standing on *wasn't ok*. In my nightmare situation it was always a Karen at the bottom, going ""yoo hoo!!! what do I need to do to get some assistance in here!!!!"" or something along those lines. After she stopped shaking, she walked away and I (slowly) climbed down. 

I turned my back to quickly replenish the stock I'd pulled (it only takes ten seconds and I'd already gone to all that trouble) and when I went to walk around to find my manager I couldn't find one, nor could I see the woman. I told a coworker I needed a bathroom break but I really just needed to calm down, and when I came back the woman had definitely left the store, and I kinda just let it slide I guess.

Him: ""I have a [camera] and I want to connect it with my computer.""

Me: ""Oh, okay! No problem, sir, those kinds of cables are right over here.""

Now, we have the USB-C and Micro-USB cables mixed in with each other, so I figure I should let him know which is which. I've done the same thing with plenty of other people and they were more than capable of figuring it out.

Me: ""So, make sure when you're selecting your cable, it ha-""

Him: ""These are too expensive.""

He yanks the cable out of my hand as I'm in the middle of saying ""Is this what you're looking  for"" and starts walking towards the exit, and I chase after him, explaining that he needs the box in order to check out. He barks that he doesn't need it, finally grabbing it out of my hand when I restate that he needs a barcode if he intends to pay for it.

msmeowsers,Your ID is... bright pink?,"At work, I keep bright pink sticky notes with me. I doodle, keep notes, and honestly just fiddle with them to keep calm during our favorite problem-customers-meltdowns.

Today, I was helping a gentleman with a purchase that required showing his ID. I had already set the ID back down in front of him on the counter. The purchase was made, yet he kept staring down at me. 

""I need my ID."" he says, staring at my hands. In my hands were my clearly bright -pink- sticky notes. At first I was very confused and said,

""Yes sir, its right there."" and nodded down at his ID. He didn't look down. His eyes clearly darted from my notes to my eyes.

""I see you holding it."" he says.

Now, this customer had already been rude earlier. I was already at the level of ""done with you"". I looked from my brightly covered paper in my hands, up at him, back to my paper, back to him.

""Sir. Your ID is right down there if you look-""

""I -SEEEEEEE- it in your hands"" he spits, putting emphasis on the word see. He was trying to mock me. But how do you feel mocked when you know they're 100% wrong?

I finally point as well, right at his ID . The one right in front of him. The one NOT in my hand. The one that is clearly not bright pink.

""Oh. there it is."" and he just grabs it and leaves. No 'I'm sorry', no 'oh I was confused', nothing.",TalesFromRetail,2570,1568387589
littlemisslily22,‘She’s a darling’,"I just finished my last shift temping for an accessories store and was reminded of this story.

This store sold belts, and an old lady comes in asking for one. She walks quite slowly, has a tube in her nose and is dragging what looks like an oxygen tank behind her.

I directed her to the belts, and she explains that she’s lost weight recently and needs a belt. All good. She finds one and holds it out to me, along with the money for it.

Our till is across the store, and I tell her so. It’s a pretty small shop but she looks hesitant. So I told her not to worry and just rang it up myself and brought the belt back to her.

She thanks me profusely, I say no problem, then she asks my name. I tell her and she says ‘L, you’re a darling’. Then she indicates my supervisor who is behind the till and asks if that’s my manager. I say yes. 

This old ill lady slowly makes her way to my supervisor and lets her know that I was kind, really helpful etc etc. I could hear this (it’s a very small store) and I fully teared up. Absolutely the best customer I had the whole time I was there.",TalesFromRetail,991,1568375455
viciousbreed,"We all know the music is repetitive, but it's not supposed to be at full-blown Cantina Band level.","For the past decade, I've worked in women's fashion retail. This story is from a couple of years ago, when I was a full-time assistant manager at a store in the mall. We had a staff of about a dozen people at any given time.  

My store had one of those music systems where new songs and playlists are automatically pushed to the hard drive every month. Corporate tended to keep the playlists pretty static, however, only tossing a few new songs in here and there. It was pretty standard retail pop music, and it all kind of blended together over the months and years.  

Is it any wonder we barely noticed when the playlist started to dwindle? The computer was deleting songs by its schedule, but not receiving any new downloads. Normally, we'd hear the same songs every day, but only once. We caught on when we started to hear the same songs multiple times. HelpDesk was in no hurry to do their job. We watched (listened?) helplessly as the selection narrowed more and more over the next few weeks, until it was down to about a dozen songs on repeat.  

One morning, I went in with my sales associate to open the store. It was one of the last few days before Labor Day Weekend. I turned on the music when it was time to open the doors, and ""Elastic Heart"" by Sia was playing. Neither of us really made a note of that... at first. That song ended, and the next song began.  

&gt;""... hey, didn't we just hear this song?"" my associate asked.   
&gt;""What? Uh... did we?"" I responded, honestly uncertain, and distracted by morning paperwork.  
&gt;""I'm pretty sure we did,"" she said.  
&gt;""Well, maybe it's the end of the playlist, and it just happened to restart the shuffle with the same song,"" I suggested. She agreed that might be it.   

But in our (elastic) hearts... we felt a deep sense of dread. And our fears were confirmed when the song proceeded to play a third time in a row. We laughed, since that's about all we could do, especially since HelpDesk was ""aware of the problem"" already. I wanted to just turn it off, but my associates couldn't handle the quiet.  

Over the first three days, Elastic Heart would've played approximately 453 times during open hours. I, personally, would've heard it 280 times over my three shifts (not counting my breaks, or non-open hours). Even if I were only subjected to five hours of music per shift, (which would be a conservative estimate, especially since the holiday weekend meant everyone was almost always on the sales floor), I still would've heard it about 200 times in 72 hours.  

Sure, we laughed at the absurdity, and we had the comedy of watching customer reactions as they tried to remember whether or not they had just heard the same song. Still, combined with the stress of the holiday weekend, tempers started to fray. Even the customers were more irritable, and they only had to hear the song a handful of times. I've often wondered about the deleterious psychological effects of involuntarily hearing the same few songs on a loop. Hearing just the one song, over and over, for hours and days on end... well, that takes it from brainwashing to downright torture. The humorous aspects soon withered, and I felt like we were lab rats being experimented upon.  

I couldn't take it anymore, and refused to turn it on by the fourth day, no matter what the part-timers said. To add to the nonsense, the music system didn't have any standard jacks or plugs, so we couldn't just hook our phones up and play something else over the stereo. We ended up bringing in our own Bluetooth speakers and using our personal data plans to stream music (because, of course, the store did not have wifi).  

Fixing it was a huge PITA and involved a lot of phone tag when I could get time away from the sales floor, but I eventually emerged victorious.  

... that is, until the following year, when it happened AGAIN. With the SAME SONG. I think I still have a twitch whenever I hear it.  

TL;DR: Over Labor Day Weekend, the store's music system deleted all the songs off its hard drive except ""Elastic Heart"" by Sia, and the associates insisted on keeping the stereo on. We lasted three days before taking matters into our own hands.",TalesFromRetail,1676,1568211358

G: ""*sigh* But I don't wanna deal with all that. I have class soon. Is it that hard to just give my money back?""

bungacowa,I should've used gloves,"So, I used to work at a popular retail chain where the return policy was (and still is) suuuper lax. Even if customers didn't have a receipt or the item is clearly decades old, 99% of the time managers approve returns. I was working returns that afternoon and business was pretty slow. It was just two of us at the counter and we'd have many three or four people in line, at best.

This older woman came up to my till for a return on deli chicken wings. While I asked her what was wrong with it, I opened the bag to see what we were working with. The most putrid stench of rotting food just blasted in my face. It was as if she'd eaten the chicken, tossed the bones then dug them back out of the garbage for a refund. Keeping a straight face I asked her, ""what was wrong with the food?"" She explained how the chicken was dry and tasteless and that she wanted her money back.

Okay...I asked for a receipt and she told me it was in the bag. I pick through it with the tips of my fingers and lo and behold, the receipt is at the bottom, covered in slime. Except all that ooze ended up erasing all the printer ink on the receipt. So I told her, ""I can't make out the transaction number, I'll have to speak to a manager"" She said ""you do whatever you have to do, baby"" and mentioned how she knew one specific manager. I called that one and he arrived quickly and actually did know the customer! He hugged her and they chatted while he processed her return without receipt. She got her cash back and they let me go wash my hands.

It wasn't until after I finished that I remembered...we had gloves under the counter.",TalesFromRetail,1370,1568121309
emmyemu,The one where my dumbass returned $300 of stolen goods,"Alright so this happened a few years ago when I was 17. I (thankfully) don’t work retail any more but kudos to all of you out there still fighting the good fight. 

Anyway I was 17 and I was working my first job at a pretty major US home/furniture retailer and let me say I have never, ever worked at a place that was easier to steal from. Obviously I’m not speaking from personal experience but shrink was a constant and pervasive problem at this store yet for some reason the upper management never took steps to stop it like installing those detector things, having regular security or basically anything besides saying “watch out for people stealing.” 

Anyway, I was a young naïve cashier and one day this lady came in to return all of this bedding and some other random household odds and ends. She didn’t have a receipt (not uncommon at this store we did a lot of returns without receipts) so she could only get store credit and as I told her this I was worried that she would be mad because people usually liked to give me grief for that and she had a ton of stuff but she was cool about it so I was happy and started returning everything. 

As I’m returning all of these items she started telling me about how her engagement was called off and how these had all been gifts she now had no need for and I was doing my best to console this lady as best as a high school who has no frame of reference for that kind of thing can. 

Her return total was something like over $300 so I was like, “oh I need to call a manager over to approve this” since our limit was something like $150 without manager approval. 

Then this lady starts to get nervous for reasons I can’t figure out because she’s about to get $300 in store credit! This is great for her! Then the GM comes and starts looking at things and getting this concerned look on his face and my dumb 17 year old brain still can’t figure out what’s happening. He tells me to just complete the transaction then he calls over the other manager so I do what he tells me but I’m still like ??????

The GM then ran all the product codes through our system aaaaaaand we had no record of ever having sold those items! I was conned into giving some random lady $300 in store credit that was I guess fraudulent. 

The manager (who was known for being a meanie) started yelling at me telling me this lady was going to go sell that gift card for crack and I was just like what crack dealer accepts gift cards to furniture stores? But then the GM (who was a super nice guy) calmed her down and said it was their fault for not training me for things like that so I got to keep my job but boy did I feel like a dumb ass after that one. Still haunts me to this day.",TalesFromRetail,1367,1568063669

I work at an FBO, (uh...its an airport within the airport for student pilots and obscenely rich people who are allergic to peanuts and poor people.)


Every once in a while, we get that oddball call from someone who has no idea what an FBO is.  You know the one....where they found your number by searching some vague travel related term + ""jet fuel"" or something, and you don't realize for several minutes that they don't have *any idea* who they're talking to?  


For the record, we do reserve rental cars as a courtesy service, but we don't invoice or anything, customers arrange their own payment, etc.

Blanche: ""Mah *what*?""
Me: ""The registration? Of the plane?""
Blanche: ""Oh....well....Iahh don't *know*.  Iaahm *commin' in*, and Iaah need a *car*.""


It's not unusual for passengers to not know this, but usually those that don't, are NOT making their own reservations. For anything. Ever.  But, OK, she could be a new flight attendant or something, I guess, so...time to probe gently.... ""Is this for a private aircraft, or a commercial flight?""
Blanche: ""Oh, *Iahm* flyin' on a *commercial* flight.""
Me: ""Ma'am, I'm sorry but I can only reserve rental cars for FBO customers, you'll need to call a rental car company or travel agent.""

Mangosta007,You're hiding it from me!,"As me who ever worked in UK retail up until a few years ago knows, the most exhausting yet often fun times to work used the last few hours before closing for a long bank holiday weekend. Most shops didn't open on Sundays and also stayed closed on the bank holiday.


This always sent many customers into Panic Buying Mode with people stuffing their trolleys with half a dozen loaves of bread, six pints of milk, enough fruit and veg to keep Carmen Miranda in hats for a year, etc. As a result, by closing time there were usually many items sold out. 


One particular Saturday about ten minutes before closing a furious gent barreled up to me steaming like the Flying Scotsman.

Pearl_Bronco,"""That's how it is in my job so that must be how it works here!""","For context, I need to give a description of how the credit card machines in my job work (this is important to the story.) This might be a little confusing but I'll do my best to explain. The credit card machines in my workplace turns on the contactless feature automatically when the sale begins, once the subtotal of the sale goes over €30 the machine automatically turns the contactless feature off and there is no way to manually turn it back on again, the machine does this because in my country you are only allowed pay contactless using your credit card for payments up to €30, and more than that is illegal because there is a risk of credit card fraud. However, in my country, you are allowed to pay with contactless using your phone and there is no limit but our credit card machines haven't been updated to accommodate this, once the limit goes over €30 euro you can't pay using contactless regardless of whether you're using a phone or a credit card. This has been causing problems for a while because customers come in and try to pay for shopping over €30 with their phone and I then have to explain why it won't work. Most customers just say ""oh ok"" and pay using an alternative method of payment, a couple of customers get annoyed but only one customer has ever caused a big fuss about it, and this customer is the star of the story.

I was serving customers on the till when the customer approached with her shopping, we where making smalltalk as I was scanning and bagging everything and she seemed really nice at first. The problem arose when she wanted to pay with her phone but the total was over €30. I explained to her why she can't pay with her phone but she doesn't believe me.

Customer: ""No, you're wrong.""

Me: ""Um, excuse me?""

Customer: ""You're wrong. You just need to press the contactless button.""

Me: ""Ma'am, we don't have a contactless button here. The machine turns contactless on and off automatically.""

Customer: ""No it doesn't. You just haven't pressed the contactless button yet that's why it's not working.""

Me: ""I can't, we don't have a contactless button here. I have no manual control over the contactless function on the credit card machine. It's automatic.""

Customer: ""You do have control over it. You're just not listening to me. I'm trying to show you how to do your job but you just don't want to listen""

Me: ""I am listening to you but what your asking me to do is impossible because we don't have a contactless button.""

She starts to shout attracting the attention of other people in the store.

Customer: ""YES YOU DO. THAT'S HOW TO CREDIT CARD MACHINES WORK IN MY JOB SO THAT MUST BE HOW IT IS HERE!!!""

Me: ""Your workplace must use a different credit card system to ours.""

Customer: ""NO IT DOESN'T. ALL CREDIT CARD MACHINES ARE THE SAME.""

She then tells me to call a supervisor so that she can have someone who ""actually knows what they're doing"" to finish the sale. The supervisor arrives and I try explaining the issue but the customer cuts me off.

Customer: ""No that's not the problem. The problem is that he won't press the contactless button.""

The supervisor looks confused.

Supervisor: ""Um, ma'am we don't have a contactless button on our tills.

The customers starts screaming again.

Customer: ""YES YOU DO!!!""

Then the customer and the supervisor gets into a long argument about which one of them where right. The argument goes on for about 5-10 minutes and comes to an end when the supervisor tells her to see for herself.

Supervisor: ""Fine, if you don't believe me then how about you come back here and show me where the contactless button is.""

The customer looks unsure.

Customer: ""Oh, no, that's ok.""

But my supervisor insists.

Supervisor: ""Well if you're certain you're right then you should have no problem coming back here and proving us wrong then, will you?""

The customer comes back uncertainly and looks at our till.

Supervisor: ""Well? Please show me where the contactless button is.""

Customer: ""I... I don't see it.""

My supervisor tries unsuccessfully to hide his big smug grin.

Supervisor: ""Do you believe me now?""

The customer gives him a dirty look but doesn't say anything. She just walks back to the other side of the counter and takes out her purse.

Customer: ""I guess I'll pay by card then.""

I finish the sale and the customer says thank you and leaves without looking me or my supervisor in the eye. My supervisor looks victorious.

Supervisor: ""Don't worry about her, she was just looking for an argument.""

He then walks off. He was definitely my favorite supervisor.",TalesFromRetail,752,1567858505

As you guys should know, I'm black and work in a big department store, specifically in the shoe department. In my department store, our return policy for one particular type of shoe have a limited return policy, meaning that it can be returned within a certain amount of days. We tell this to every customer who buys these shoes, and it's on the back of the receipt as well, and we are not allowed to make any exceptions.

Anyway, I just clocked in and am starting to get to work. This woman, an older black lady (who will be called Rude Customer), came over to me with a box in her arms. I approached her.

ME: Good afternoon. Do you have a return?

RUDE CUSTOMER: Yes ma'am.

We went to my register and began to start the return. Immediately, I get a notification on my computer saying that it was past the last possible return day for the shoes. Oh great.

Insert eye roll. I get the phone and call my manager. My manager came over and immediately took over the transaction. I wondered off just so I can calm down, but I heard some brief raised voices and saw the lady storm off. Whatever. I continued with my day. Shortly after I get a different customer, who was really sweet, her pair of shoes, my coworker came over to me, looking a bit angry, with the phone to her ear.

COWORKER: Hey OP. That lady came back and told me to tell you, ""Tell that black girl to tell whoever she called that I found corporate's number and I'm gonna call them!""

GreenOnionCrusader,Provided excellent customer service and a big screw you.,"So a few years back I had a seasonal job with a store.  I had been told I was going to be hired on permanently, but they gave me some excuse as to why I wasn't able to be hired two days before my seasonal job ended.  I was disappointed because I loved this job, but I figured I'd be eligible for rehire so it wasn't too bad. Looking back, I corrected the assistant manager twice (price check on seasonal clearance, backed up by the GM, I was legit right) and then suddenly wasn't going to be permanent so I know why it happened.

So I show up for my last shift, even though I was screwed over, because I'm a nice person and didn't want to leave them short handed.  I was put on the register for my last shift and had to call with increasing frequency for back up on registers because of increase in customers.  Every single time I do, the assistant manager and her little lackey (we'll call them A and B) get on the radio and passive aggressively talk to each other about how I'm calling for backup AGAIN and they sure hope I don't take up too much of their time because they have SO MUCH to get done that day.  I let it slide off me because it was my last shift and I'll be damned if I let these two push me into walking out.  Still, it was highly annoying.  

Finally, with maybe an hour left in my shift, a lady came up and was buying about $30 worth of stuff.  She said she had a $20 bill and hadn't been able to get to the coin counting machines to get her change taken care of and would I mind counting out the rest in change?  Now, I'd just listened to yet another rendition from A and B about how much of an inconvenience it was to have to come help me and they needed to be able to finish their tasks that the GM assigned them, blah blah blah. I looked at my customer and said, ""Ma'am, why don't we count out all the change first and then take the rest out of the $20? Those change machines take a percentage and we're always happy to have change!"" It took me twenty minutes to count it all out. There was only about $6 in quarters and maybe another $5 in dimes, but I kept going until I used up as much of her change as possible. Every one of the coin spots was full to the top, plus a bunch extra tossed haphazardly in the extra spot off to the side.  B couldn't leave the other register the entire time because of customers and I got to out do them in passive aggressiveness right before leaving.  Left that place with a poo-eating grin and I've never gone back.

Mangosta007,FOOLS! Why don't you sell your rival's products?,"A long time ago in a southern English village far, far away...


In my pre-university days back in the early 90s I worked weekends at a small supermarket whose name rhymed with Late Rose. I had many odd encounters while there (with both customers and my often 'eccentric' colleagues).


One sunny Saturday, a well-heeled gent approached me.


WHG: Excuse me. Where would I find the Tusko (our only local rival supermarket) crisps?


Me: Um... In Tusko, Sir.


WHG: What?? Haven't you got any in stock?


Me: I'm afraid not, Sir. The only place you can get Tusko own brand crisps is... well... Tusko.


WHG: (getting a tad fractious): That's utter rubbish. You can get them anywhere! And if you don't sell them, you should. They're far better than your own brand crisps (SPOILER they were the same crisps in different bags but you don't tell customers that).


Me: I assure you, Sir, shops' own brand crisps or, indeed, any own brand goods are only ever sold in those actual shops. 


WHG: (leans up close to my face and stage whispers) You just don't want a rival making a profit in your shop. It's PATHETIC and that's why Tusko will put you out of business: if you don't start selling Tusko products, everyone will go to Tusko to get them. Then you'll be sorry! 


With that he stood back, grabbed a multipack of Late Rose crisps, made a strange attempt at a smug face (or he might have had trapped wind) and strode off, presumably in search of some Saintsberrys digestives.

Luna_Lionhart,"""$1 is too expensive.""","I recently got a new job at my local Five Below, after being laid off from my job at a plant nursery. Everything in the store is 5 or less, so we actually get a lot of people come in for back to school shopping, hoping to save money. 

I'm on mobile, sorry for spacing.

This was probably my second day, and my first late shift, so I was a little nervous but determined to do well. I was the only cashier at the register because the manager was restocking items. Eventually, I one woman approaches my register and I smile and give my usual greeting.

Me: Hello ma'am! Are you ready to check out?

C: Yes, but I have one question.

Me: Of course, go ahead.

C: Are these really a dollar a piece?

She was talking about a large stack of folders she brought to the register. I checked them in the computer first, really not wanting to mess up when I was still new, and saw that it was the correct price.

Me: Yes Ma'am, those are each one dollar.

She smiles, so I went back to ringing up her items, thinking all was well.

C: That is RIDICULOUSLY expensive.

I was sort of taken aback by the way she said it, but I could kind of understand what she was talking about. She had a lot of them, so it added up to a bit of a high price, plus she had other things to check out as well. But the folders she was buying were the kind that were made to last. If she was buying those cheap plastic ones (which costed 25 cents) I would understand a dollar being ridiculously expensive.

Of course I wasn't going to SAY any of that. I just stopped smiling, put my head down and continued to ring up her items. I gave her the total, she paid and walked out. Nothing dramatic (thankfully, as I want to keep this job) but it did put a damper on my mood that day. I always feel bad when a customer complains about something, but I don't know what she wanted me to do. Agree with her?",TalesFromRetail,1352,1567695338
glass_heart2002,Stupid questions don’t always come from customers.,"This is short, but puzzling to me. Makes me laugh actually. 
I’m training a new cashier and she’s, well, not the brightest. 
I have to show her how to do all of her cashiering duties each shift we work together, it’s like she comes back each day with no memory of working the days and now weeks prior. 

But this question just blew me away. 

Our freight day is generally the same as any typical retail store. A truck comes in early in the morning, delivers hundreds of totes of our products, and we stock them. 
Simple? Well, I guess after this it’s not. Haha

So I am training her (again) on how to use the scanner to show where product locations and positions are and she holds her hand up to ask a question. 
I pause and she simply asks “so this stuff is just what’s left at the register that customers didn’t want?”
I really had to pause and take a deep breath to not laugh out loud. 
Mind you as she asks this one of the other cashiers is bringing up 8 totes, from the back, off the truck she saw earlier. 
To add to the 20 stacked around us in different aisles. 
I was perfectly pleasant (using my “nice” voice as my kids call it) and simply said
 “no, this is our order from the warehouse for the week, every week we restock the shelves based off what was purchased previously.”

It’s mind boggling the things she just does not notice. This may sound mean, or harsh, but trust me there are so many other bizarre questions coming from this lady daily. It’s really taken, and taught me, more patience. 

Makes you wonder how she’s made it through 50+ years of life though.",TalesFromRetail,917,1567670429
mamahazard,They called my regular a b**** :(,"I work at a very small, busy store. We sell bags for 10¢, and have boxes if you forget to bring reusable bags. Some people being in extra plastic bags they've stashed at home, and give them to us to disperse. Everything here is insanely cheap. Full cart of groceries for $30, cheap. 

We got absolutely slammed after the holiday weekend, as we expected. It got so busy that we ran out of extra bags AND boxes, which usually doesn't happen. 

I had an entire family over 250lbs each, all adults. They stank. They were mean.

It came time to pay and pack their items, but when I mentioned that we ran out of free bags and boxes, but have 10¢ bags available, the lady who did all the talking got pissed. ""I'll see about that!"" as she stormed off to ask stockers. 

In the meantime, one of the guys with her just asked for a few of the 10¢ bags and we packed up. She came back, rammed into my regular, and started barking at the guy who got the bags. She complained about how long the wait was (it's not, at all, she just took forever). 

My regular went ""those people are rude"" as I rang her up. I smiled real big said ""have a nice day!"" She knew they ticked me off, too, and said ""good luck!""

I turned back around to see all the dog food I was pricing, in their cart. ""Hey you didn't pay for that"". ""Oh. Thought we did."" as they reluctantly have it back. 

I'll give them the benefit of the doubt here, but they didn't even stop by the pet section. No way they thought they had paid for it. 

I'll have a good rant with my customer next week.",TalesFromRetail,2008,1567615126
Knever,"""You have to sell it to me for *that* price! It's the law!","I used to work as a cashier at a grocery store a long time ago.

At the front of the store, near the registers, we have stacks of bags of charcoal. There are a few different kinds, all clearly labeled. Two of the bags look rather similar, being the same colour, but still clearly different brands if you bother to read. These two are placed at opposite ends with two or three other brands in between them. They are Samurai (cheap brand, we'll say $10) and Shogun (expensive brand, we'll say $40).

Naturally, people will sometimes put something back in the wrong place after deciding they don't want it.

So, one fateful day, a middle-aged gentleman comes to my register (I'm not going to call him ""MAG"" because I think it's silly to abbreviate names like that in stories like these. No offense to those who do, I just don't see the point) with a shopping cart filled with your normal groceries, and as I'm scanning the items, he walks over to the charcoal pallets.

I see him walk over to the Samurai stack, and I notice that someone had placed a bag of Shogun on it. He scans the prices up on the wall and picks up the Shogun bag, since it was supposedly the cheapest one he saw.

I know what's going to happen, so I try to diffuse the situation before it even happens (naturally, you know I fail since you're reading this story).

""Sir, just so you know, that charcoal is Shogun; not Samurai from the stack where you found it. It's $40,"" I tell him.

He looks at the bag and then back up at the wall above the Samurai stack and sees the price.

""But it says $10 on the price label,"" he responds.

I point out, ""That's for the Samurai charcoal, it says so right above the price.""

""... but I got it from that stack,"" he said, pointing to the Samurai stack.

""I understand, but it's not the same brand. Another customer must have put it there when they decided they didn't want it.""

Now, I should say I have a small tic where I quickly turn my head to the side. Usually happens when I get stressed, and dealing with this guy was starting to get stressful. So my tic happens, and his eyes light up.

""Oh! Oh, I see,"" he feigns. He must think I'm mentally challenged because of my tic.

He continues, ""Well, champ, why don't you go ahead and scan it and we'll see what price comes up?"" with a stupid grin on his face, 1,000,000,000% sure it's going to scan at $10.

I scan it, and sure enough, $40.

""But the sign says $10!"" he whines.

I try to show him the Shogun stack, ""Sir, if you'd look over there, *that* is the brand that you have here; Shogun.""

He looks over and sees the Shogun stack. He looks back at the Samurai stack, the Shogun bag, and the prices of both brands. Something clicks. He doesn't say anything for a few moments, and I can hear him thinking.

""...Oh, so they're different. Well, you still have to sell me this one for $10, though.""

???

""I'm sorry, sir, I can't do that.""

""You have to; it's the law!"" he barks.

""I'm sorry, what law is that?"" I ask, slightly scared.

""It was mislabled, so you have to sell it to me for the lower price! It's false advertising otherwise!""

A guy from another lane shouts over, ""Dude, that's not what false advertising is. Someone just put the wrong bag on that stack, you idiot!""

Charcoal dude ignores him and says, ""Are you going to sell it to me for the lower price or do I have to talk to your manager?""

I'm just about done with this guy, so I shout back towards Customer Service, ""ID!"" (We need a Manager ID card to change prices. That's not why I called, though; it also brings a manager out to solve any issues.)

So one of the managers arrives and I explain what happened to her, with him trying to butt in every few seconds. I forgot exactly what he said, but he lied about some aspects, and the guy who was in the other lane was still there, so he came over and corroborated my version of events.

My manager said, ""I'm sorry, sir. The prices are clearly marked and this is clearly Shogun brand charcoal, which is $40. Samurai brand charcoal is $10. If you want charcoal for $10, your only option is the Samurai brand.""

The guy looked back the charcoal pallets and the Shogun bag he had.

""... BUT IT'S THE LAW! I'M SUPPOSED TO GET THE CHEAPER PRICE BY LAW! IT'S THE LAW!""

(You'd think he was a lawyer with how much he said the word ""law"")

He argued with my manager for a few more seconds, but she wouldn't budge. He eventually got fed up and stormed off without his groceries, yelling, ""THEY'RE BREAKING THE LAW! FALSE ADVERTISING! IT'S AGAINST THE LAW! REEEEEEEEEEEEE!"" (Okay, he didn't really screech, but I'm taking artistic liberty).",TalesFromRetail,2064,1567545171
Opticionnerd,You're lying a I hope your companiy closes for good,"Hey guys,

I'm from Germany and english  is my second language. I'm writing on my phone, because it helps me to spell the word correctly.

I work as an optician in one of the biggest optician companies in Germany. I a the deputy branch manager.

Yesterday I had an insane old man as a customer. And this is how it went.

Me=me OD=old dude

My apprentice had send over to OD. Ge was sitting at one of our tables his rollater and his sunglasses in his hands.

Me: good day, my name is me,how may I help you. OD: I lost my glasses for long distance and need new one with the eyesight of my sunglasses.

Me: no problem, do you have your eyesight in writing? OD: no Me:Okay, had you ever bought glasses at our company? OD: mumbles something I can't understand.

I assume he doesn't know. So I take the tablet to check our database.

Me: what's your last name, please? OD: mumbles agai Me: sorry, could you please repeat that, I wasn't able to understand you properly because of the background noise. (It wasn't really loud, but OD was rude in his tone, from the beginning and I didn't want it to escalate.) OD(in a really rude tone): wy do you need it anyway. Me: I need it, to look you up in your database. OD: you can not find me there, I've never bought glasses here before.

Me: okay, then i need your sunglasses to check the eyesight of the lenses.

He doesn't react at all, but lets me take the sunglasses. I can see at first sight, that the glasses are not older than 2 years and that they are without powers.

I go and check anyway, to not upset him even more. While I'm on the way he shouts after me in an even ruder tone than before: I hope that I'll get them back. (Yes OD really accuses me of stealing his 2 year old sunglasses I an optician shop)

So I went to check the power of the lenses and as I thought, 0,0dpt in both lenses. No eyesight at all.

So I went back and tell him Me: sorry but there are no eyesight in your sunglasses.

And that is the point when it got ridiculous.

OD: your are lying. You just want to cover up your incompetence. These sunglasses where prescribed by a doctor. You're accusing the doctor of lying. Your company is crap anyway and I'll leave and never come back.

I was say nothing. Just stop up got to the door and opened it for him, while i was thinking: good, this way I don't have to kick him out.

On his way out he stopt at the table next to us and complained about something I couldn't understand. Then he went on his way out. I  the moment he got to the door he turned to me for one last time. OD: I hope your whole company has to close for good. You are the worst. Me: have a nice day.

Velvetxkao,Woman gets angry when I tell her she can't sit on the stairs and block everyone trying to use them,"The place I work in has stairs to the second level. They're curved a few steps up so you can't see around the corner as you're coming back down them, meaning if anything/anyone is obstructing the stairs at the bottom, you're not going to know until you're basically falling over them when you're on the way back down.

I needed to go upstairs. A middle aged woman and her 2 grandkids were sat in a line on the stairs, leaving a couple of inches on the one side free for people to try to pass by. I told her, ""Sorry guys, you can't sit on the stairs. It's a fire exit and it's dangerous because someone could fall over you.""

She immediately got snappy with me and said, ""I'm sure we'd move if there was a fire, love!"" I said that's fine but it's still a health and safety issue so you can't stay sitting there. She yelled and said I was being ridiculous, then stood up from the stairs. I headed up the stairs to get the thing I needed. She sarcastically told the kids as I started to walk, ""Let's stand up and as soon as that's woman's gone we'll sit back down."" As I got to the top of the stairs and out of view she yelled ""JOBSWORTH!""

BonniRaven,“I’m Calling Corporate Because You Used Your Radio”,"This was about two/three years ago when I still worked Loss Prevention at a large store that sold designer things for cheap.

It was the morning, so we only had one cashier, the Front End Supervisor (FES), until the next one came in at 10:30. We had opened at 8:30 and already had about ten people waiting to come in, so you can see the issue.

The only other people besides the FES and myself, were two associates each assigned to the fitting rooms (one on the first floor and one on the second floor), and two managers. The managers were in the stockroom dealing with a large shipment that the stock team wasn’t able to finish, so they were trying to get everything tagged and ready to go out.

Being the only Loss Prevention there, I was assigned to be by the door to watch for potential shoplifters (customers that avoided making eye contact with me when I greeted them, large empty bags that were open, customers near tall racks just staring at me or the cashiers). I noticed that by 9, there was already a line of about seven people waiting to be rung up.

One customer was third in line for purchases, and calls over to me.

Customer: “Can you call for another cashier please?”

I nod, and immediately used my radio headset to ask our managers if they were able to help with the line. Our store manager responded with a “No”. Our FES is a very fast cashier and had managed to get to the customer that had asked for help in five minutes.

As soon as she was done, the customer walked right up to me and asked me for my name. I told her my name and this is what she said:

Customer: “I’m going to call corporate, because you were so rude to ignore me.”

I responded that I didn’t know what she meant.

Customer: “You didn’t ask for another cashier. You ignored me.”

I told her that I didn’t ignore her, that I asked our managers if the could help with the line. My radio headset is very noticeable, and I motioned to it.

Customer: “I didn’t hear you ask anyone! I didn’t hear an announcement!”

No joke, she actually thought I could only asked for help using the announcement system. I told her I used my radio, which doesn’t connect to our PA system and our manager had no one else that could help.

She scoffed and left. I never heard back about what happened so I assumed she didn’t call",TalesFromRetail,1399,1567350343

EnragedErin,I WANT MY BROWNIES AND CHEESE!!!,"Amazing start to my shift!

I get to my register, open it up, and the first customer comes rolling in. I noticed this customer had 5 boxes of Betty Crocker *Favorites* and a LOT of cheese. I go on autopilot and being scanning... when she clears her throat.

&gt; Customer: Those brownie mixes are supposed to be $0.50 each. Your register is saying it's $2.49. Where's the discount you displayed on your door?

&gt; Me: I-I'm sorry??

*Completely brand new on the register and had no freakin' clue what she was talking about.*

&gt; Customer: Did you not see your own sign?!

&gt; Me: One second, ma'am.

I began looking around frantically for someone to help me. I had no idea what was going on, what discount she was talking about, or what to do in this situation. When the bagger clocked in and saw my frantic look, he rushed over.

&gt; Bagger: Is something wrong?

&gt; Me: Apparently there's a discount on the Betty Crocker mixes? The register isn't showing that discount.

&gt; Bagger: *turns to face the customer who is looking like it's the end of the world* Do you have a rewards card?

&gt; Customer: NO! And I don't want one! I just want my discount! You have it on a sign out front!

&gt; Bagger: That might be bad printing on our part. If you look closer at the sign, it says ONLY WITH REWARD CARD.

My GOD if this woman could have gotten any redder, she would've been classified as a tomato and joined the cheeses on her belt!

&gt; Customer: That's unacceptable! You shouldn't print false advertisements!

I again give a look that says ""Please... help meeeeeeeeee"" because I was drawing complete blanks on how to help this woman, and she was starting to scare me a bit.

&gt; Me: Do you want me to void the scans?

&gt; Customer: NO! I want my brownie mix at the price you advertised!

&gt; Me: Ma'am, as Bagger said you will not receive the discount without a card. I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.

&gt; Customer: You're not sorry! I want to speak to your manager!

Had no clue how to page a manager, and my nametag had a tag under it that said I was NEW, so Bagger went to get a manager.

&gt; Me: I'll just set these aside and scan the rest of your items until he gets back.

I grab a pack of cheese... scanned it...

&gt; Customer: Where's the discount for the cheese?

&gt; Me: I can only assume it's tied with the card, ma'am.

Just in freaking time! Bagger and the manager came back just as she was about to say something else.

&gt; Manager: Is there a problem?

&gt; Customer: Your damn right there's a problem! Your cashier here is saying I can't get the $0.50 discount on my brownie mix and is now trying to cheat me out of the discount on my cheese!

&gt; Manager: Do you have a rewards card? The discount applies at the end of the transaction if you do.

&gt; Customer: NO, AND I DON'T WANT ONE.

&gt; Manager: Then I'm sorry, ma'am. You will not get the discount without a card. It's completely free to sign up and can be used immediately. EnragedErin has a bunch of them here for any customer who wants a card.

&gt; Customer: I don't WANT a card! Clean out your ears!

My manager CLEARLY did not like that. With a calm inhale, he signaled for me to step aside and cancelled her entire transaction.

&gt; Manager: I'm going to have to ask you to leave. You're holding up the line and starting to become a disturbance to the other customers.

&gt; Customer: I'm not leaving!

&gt; Manager: Yes, you are. *he went to grab the customer's arm to escort her out of the building and turned to look at me before walking away* Sorry about that, EnragedErin. Please ring up the other customers while Bagger puts these items into a return buggy.

While Bagger grabbed the items I had sent to the far end, I looked at the customer that was behind the raging lady. There was that sympathetic grin you could almost tell was a grimace.

&gt; Customer 2: Wow, you really got thrown to the wolves, didn't you?

&gt; Me: Phew... tell me about it. Anyways, I am so sorry for the delay! How's your day so far?

The rest of my shift went without incident, but holy crap I almost burst out laughing thinking about it when I got home. Just the ridiculousness of this middle aged woman pitching a fit... over cheese and brownies.",TalesFromRetail,1062,1567226799
SpookyKnees,I do not like being lied about,"This happened this morning and I am still mad about it. I'm a cake decorator so i hear about customers disliking things all the time but this really was upsetting. I'm decorating cakes and this woman comes up to me and asks if it was okay for her to pick out a pack of 24 cupcakes and have me shape them into the number 9 and write happy birthday. I usually would say no but it was slow and I was feeling nice so I said yeah sure! So I take the cupcakes and shape them into the 9, the frosting gets a little messed up because I had to grab each cupcake individually and it got messy, nbd, it didnt look bad at all. I give it to her and she just looks at me with the most sour face She says she hates it and wants me to remake it again or she's getting a manager. Well I remade it because the manager was on lunch otherwise I wouldn't have cared and just told her to go get them. I remake it how she told me too and give it to her, she said it looked better but now she's mad that I changed the price. For 24 cupcakes it's $13.98 whereas for the cupcake cake it is $18.98. she's mad but still takes it and doesn't even say thank you. 10 minutes later a different manager comes up and starts yelling at me about how rude I was and how bad the cupcakes look. I'm just like what. my manager gets back from lunch and is like what happened. Apparently, the woman told her I was super rude the whole time and said that I made the cake so horrible and that when asked to redo it I just took a cupcake out of the middle and rolled my eyes and called her a b word under my breath and when I gave it back to her said ""here's your 9 b****!"" None of this happened, at all, i was very nice and patient with her. I will admit the cake looked kinda wonky after the second attempt but that's because I had to keep touching the frosting when I moved them to make the shape.

I was 18, working my first big girl job at your favorite VERY RED retail store. I started in photo, but that went belly up about three months in. Surprisingly, I was offered a management position in guest service/front lanes ... but it basically meant I got .25 more an hour to do the same thing the big guys do for half the pay. But whatever. I liked my job and was pretty good at it.

The cast
Me: new kinda manager
Kelly: new cashier
Paula: extreme middle aged couponer gone rouge

I was in the office that had a a one way mirror type window, doing paperwork. The lane in front of the window had our new hire. Kelly. She was there for this exact reason. 

I look up from my work to check on her now and then.  I see Kelly looking back and forth, kind of panicked and I calmly walked out to see A METRIC FK TON of coupons stacked in front of her. Kelly tried to scan each one, some working others not. 

Paula flips out each time one doesn’t scan, screaming at this poor girl.

P: JUST SCAN IT RIGHT!

K: I-I’m sorry ma’am, it’s expired it won’t scan...

P: I’m sure there’s some sort of override, just do it.

K: N-no ma’am I honestly can’t, it won’t let me.

Me:  It’s okay Kelly, I’ll take over. Ma’am this is a large stack of coupons you have. The ones she can’t scan are expired and are manufacturers coupons. There’s genuinely nothing we can do with them or they’re ours but they don’t apply to your items.

P: I’m pretty sure you’re lying but I have places to be.... what about the rest?!

(Mind you this is about 25+ coupons at least)

Me, looking through the massive pile, sorting expired and irrelevant coupons: Okay ma’am. You have 3 valid coupons left. It brings your total to $xx.xx.

P: YOU’VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. I double checked each of those coupons!

Me, gesturing to both piles I made while sorting: these are expired... many by quite a while. This other pile are ones that don’t apply to any of your items. I know it’s frustrating, but I have to follow policy not just for the store, but for the manufacturers. 

P: (I’m pretty sure you know what she said)

Me: ma’am... I am the manager. That’s why I came out here to sort this out. 

P: I don’t believe you , you’re just a kid! Get me the real manager!

Me, gesturing to my name badge: I am indeed the manager of the front end. (She doesn’t know what our acronyms for managers are) I don’t want to be rude, but we cannot accept these coupons. I have throw the expired ones out, but you can keep the others in case they apply to other items in the future. 

P: FINE. Just let me pay so I can leave. And keep your coupons! I’m never shopping here again!

(Awww darn it!)

I finished the transaction, trashed the MOUNTAIN of coupons and turned my newbie. 

Me: This doesn’t happen often (half truth, but I don’t want to spook her) but if you ever feel sketchy about something like this or anything else, flip your light on and stall them. I’ll run over right away, okay?

Kelly nodded and I gave a quick side hug then a thumbs up.  I believe she stayed there till the place closed down. Great gal.

crispysilicon,"Tires chains aren't made for stripping paint, but okay","From the world of auto parts a few years ago.

A lady comes into my store asking for tire chains for her sons BMW. She has the tire size, and I check and sell her some ""Z"" rated cable chains made for the tire size and approved for the vehicle (PLT: You have to check the owners manual to see what kind of chains you can use!). 

She goes out the door a happy customer after I explain how to install them (also included instructions).

Fast forward a week. I get a phone call from that lady. Her son's BMW, is trashed. She says the cables were faulty and snapped and the cables have done significant damage to the car. The car is stuck out of state with her son however. I tell her if the chains are at fault I can help her, and provide her another copy of the receipt as the original is with her son. She says she will be there shortly.

So she shows up about an hour later and shows me pictures of the car, it's probably a total. The cables snapped off the rear driver wheel and whipped around the outside of the car. The cables reached from the rear driver side all the way to the trunk. It looks like you took a giant wire brush to the side of it, and the sheet metal is badly damaged too. Ouch.

So I print her off another copy of the receipt and put her in contact with the chain company and she goes out the door.

She comes back two days later, pretty upset. She says the chain company is pushing back, want the chains sent, chains had to be cut off the car and are already gone. She has her son on the phone with her when she came in.

I try to tell her there isn't much else I can do, and when I do, her son demands to speak with me. Sure?

Son: Why can't you help us out here? We bought these from you!

Me: You did, but this is a manufacturer issue at this point, I've done what I can.

Son: Oh. Well, I think you guys should be handling this, since we bought them there.

Me: I've already explained that this is out of my hands now, I'm sorry I can't do more to help. Honestly, you're the first person I've had this kind of problem with, what happened if you don't mind?

Son: I was on the highway and they just snapped. Lucky I was only going a little over 50.

Me: ...What?

Son: They just snapped.

Me: No. How fast did you say you were going?

Son: A little over 50.

Me: ...

Me: They chains have VERY specific instructions not to exceed 30 mph....

Son: ...

Son: Wat?

I handed the phone back to his mom, who had been listening and was now staring at the phone in horror.

She was not a happy camper as she left the store screaming at her idiot son. Double ouch.",TalesFromRetail,1654,1567094133
Sallad0,"""You should really know your stock better.""","A couple years ago, I was a cashier at a small store which sold accessories, decorating, and DIY crafting materials. When this happened, I had worked there for about three months. I knew the items we sold pretty well, but I didn't quite know every shelf like the back of my hand yet. I had already put in a lot of effort to learn the stock, though.

I'm the only employee around when Karen walks in, and our registers are right next to the front doors, so Karen comes up to me.

Karen: ""Where do you keep your beads?""

Me: ""I'm sorry, ma'am. To my knowledge, we don't carry beads.""

K: ""You do. I know you do. My friend told me that she bought beads here before.""

I knew full well that we didn't carry beads, but I didn't feel like getting into it with Karen.

Me: ""If we do, they'll be in \[X aisle\].""

She goes over to that aisle and comes back to my register after a bit -- carrying a few items, none of which are beads.

K: ""You were right, I didn't find any beads.""

Me: ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience."" I continue to ring her up.

K: ""You should really get to know your stock better.""

Now I'm confused. Did she just call me ignorant for correctly telling her that we didn't carry an item??

K: ""Next time you're working, you should come in early, off the clock, to browse the store and familiarize yourself with what you sell.""

I'm fuming, but I knew I'd get in trouble if I defended myself to her. I manage to get out a ""Yes, ma'am,"" but I'm pretty sure I'm turning red in the face.

She walked out, and I spent the rest of the day telling her off in my head.

TL;DR: I correctly told a Karen that we didn't sell an item, and she told me that I should learn the store's stock better.",TalesFromRetail,1134,1567061646
Heroic25,“I thought about screaming help”,"So this happened yesterday right before closing time. I work at a hardware store, and had just came in from my lunch. I walked over towards the paint area and here this lady screaming like someone was dying. 

C: EXCUSE ME DOES ANYONE WORK IN THE PAINT AREA?!

She’s just screaming that....to no one just standing in the middle of the store. So I walk up and help her.

Me: excuse ma’am do you need help? 

C: of course I do! I need x amount of paint.

Me: alright give me about ten minutes for all this. 

She orders quite a bit of paint and some where in the mix I fucked up and gave her a gallon instead of a quart. My boss tells me to just discount it and let her take the whole thing. That’s fine with me she’s gets out of here quicker and I don’t have to be yelled at. 

She comes back and she’s actually really nice and polite when I explain what happened. So I follow her up to the register and she actually starts telling the cashier what happened and saying it was her fault I messed up. 

While I’m standing there waiting for her to finish checking out another gentleman ( other guy)comes up.

OG: excuse me sir I have a question to ask you. I thought about just screaming help in the middle of the store but I’m not and idiot. 

Then he just dead stares at the First Lady. It took all I had to not bust out laughing. I answered his question and the First Lady tucked tail and scurried out without saying anything else.",TalesFromRetail,3015,1566923219
sweetheart92115,I actually have a positive post!,"While ringing of a customer yesterday she told me she loves coming through my line because I'm always so efficient, helpful, etc.  So I thanked her and told her that was really nice to hear. Then towards the end of my shift, the owner of a local sports bar and grill came through my line and said, ""Hey, there's my favorite cashier!""  I've rung him up many times over the years, but this is the first time he verbally told me that he likes it when I'm the one who rings him up. Gotta say, those two compliments probably helped me get through my day.  I really do try to make it a point to get to know my regulars while still being friendly to those I haven't developed such rapports with yet. Therefore, it's always nice when someone sees the effort you put in to provide great service, and on top it that, tells you to your face how much they appreciate you.  Comments/compliments like this helps sustain me after dealing with rude people, idiots, etc.  Am definitely thankful for my friendly customers and regulars!",TalesFromRetail,843,1566899505
Rogue106,Let me ruin your rating because you were busy,"A couple of days a go I assisted a woman with updating her plans. Gave her an hour of my time for something that made our store very little. At the end I asked if she could please complete the survey she receives in her email and that a 10 means I've done my job right. 

These surveys are grossly scaled. Anything below a 9 is a detractor and lowers your commissions at the end of the month. These surveys also refer to their ”{company name} experience"" so people often rate the company not realising they're rating us. But this lady I specifically told it reflected on me. 

Yesterday she came back into the shop regarding an issue and my manager assisted her. I was with another customer but came to the front to grab them a charger. When there she said hi and I said hi and nodded back then left. 

This morning my manager opens their emails and boom she gave me a zero commenting ""All they care about is getting your money. No after sales service!""

This was my 12th survey of this month but because of scaling it caused me to drop 20/100 points. This potentially loses me hundreds of dollars in commision. So thank you cranky crone. Thank you for taking your frustration out on me and my minimum wage service.",TalesFromRetail,643,1566861604
pskinner93,Customer Basically Calls Me Stupid,"So I basically got called stupid by a customer. They gave me their cash and I waited a moment to see if they wanted to also use change.  I put in the amount they gave me and the drawer opened, and then they go 'I have the change'.


I tell them that company policy is that we are not allowed to accept any money after the drawer is open.


They tried to argue and I repeated the policy.


After I gave them their change they said 'Well your company must think you're stupid'.  Before leaving with a huff.


I then went and told my manager about it in an I can't believe this happened way and she got so upset on my behalf and told me that if something like that happens again to let her know and she will handle it.",TalesFromRetail,1340,1566835702
bread_stan,”It’s a paper bag GET OVER IT!”,"So I work in a supermarket in Ireland that has self service tills. The other day I was on self service for the night and these two women came up to the self scan beside me. They were buying a couple of cakes and other bits of food. 

So bear in mind, my work sells clothes too and we are not allowed to give the paper clothes bags to customers that aren’t buying clothes, because we ran out of them completely a couple of months ago for a couple of weeks and our managers had a meeting and were informed not to hand them out unless it’s for clothing.

Anyways one of the women asks me if there’s any boxes so they can carry their stuff. I tell her if there is they’ll be down at the end of checkouts. So she goes and walks down the whole way to check the ends of the checkouts for boxes and spots at the very end checkout the paper bags. She goes in behind the till and grabs a paper bag. And that’s when I go up to her.

Me: Sorry I’m afraid the paper bags are only for clothing.
Customer: (Looking shocked) So we can’t take this paper bag for our stuff?
Me: You weren’t buying any clothing so... no.
Customer: (Looking even more annoyed)
Are you serious?
Me: Yep.
Customer: (Giving me the paper bag back and answering back really viciously) It’s a paper bag GET OVER IT! 

Customer storms off and eventually finds a box for her stuff. My manager saw this all happening and gave me a thumbs up and I was there with my blood boiling.

TLDR; Customer snaps at me for not letting her have a paper clothing bag for her purchases when she wasn’t buying any clothes and we’re not allowed to give them out",TalesFromRetail,1562,1566761786
Bitchothy,I yelled back at a customer,"I'm an assistant manager at a dollar store. Our frozen food truck had come, and when they come they have to be received and processed immediately.  I'm still not fully trained, and the new store manager told me to handle it on my own despite never having processed a frozen food truck.  Luckily, the driver knew how to do everything and guided me through it, but it was time for one of the cashiers to go home.  She was supposed to leave at 1:30, but at this point it was already 1:50 and the store manager hadn't taken  her down, so I ran up to let her count her drawer down and go home.
       The other cashier was calling for a manager's assistance, but the sm wouldn't come up to help her.  Our store has a very strict policy that non-managers are not allowed in the office alone, and under no circumstances can money be left unattended.  I told her I would be as quick as I could, and the customer she was with said in a snarky voice that she would wait.  By the time we were done counting the money, the cashier's line was insanely long.    The customer she was with tells me I took too long and storms out.  Then the cashier tells me her register is starting to freeze up and was taking too long to print receipts. The frozen food was still out so I was trying to run back to let the other manager know that I couldn't do it right then and that I needed to help the cashier.
       On my way to talk to the manager the woman at the back of the line says, ""YOU need to open another lane right now!""
       I said back to her, ""Yes ma'am I know, but I need to speak to someone really quick I'll be right back."" She rolled her eyes at me.
       After I let the manager know what was happening, I ran back up and told everyone to move to another register since I was moving her.
        An older gentleman gave me a nasty look and immediately screamed, ""WHY!?""
       ""Sir, her register isn't working properly anymore and it's being slow.""
       ""WELL THEN YOU NEED TO OPEN UP ANOTHER REGISTER!""
       I have never yelled at a customer before, but my stress levels were through the rough and he was unnecessarily aggressive towards me and wasn't the first person to tell at me that day.  So I yelled back, ""You're going to HAVE to wait because I need to move her to another register FIRST, and THEN I will open up another lane and check you out!""
       Everything was silent until I started moving her drawer after she finished checking out another customer.  Then the woman she had just checked out looked at the cashier and said, ""Thank you so much for being so courteous and patient!"" Then she looks at me and says, ""And YOU need to learn to respect people!""
       I didn't even respond and just opened up another register.  I was trying not to get upset, buy I could tell I was bright red and couldn't really hide the anger in my face.  Luckily, the man didn't come to my lane and everyone who came to mine was extra polite and one even started telling me she can't believe people are so rude to customer service people.  It felt good to finally have someone not antagonize me.  It also felt really good to yell even though I probably shouldn't have.
       TLDR; stressed at work, couldn't help my cashier immediately, her register stops working and I need to move her, irate customer yells at me, I yell back.",TalesFromRetail,715,1566708176

Meanttobepracticing,Wearing armour plate to work. I made a shoplifter run a mile.,"For background I’m a Sabaton fan. My work one day decided to do a non-uniform day, with the rule being that you had to be creative, Now I own an armoured vest much like the one Sabaton’s lead singer wears on stage, so I decided to wear that and the camo pants that go with it, and my black military boots. (Google a picture of the band if you want to see what I mean) 

So off I went to work. Working in the vest was a bit of a pain as the plates on the front meant bending was made harder. But I was luckily assigned to doing some tidying. 

Then a code 100 got shouted. Basically this means that whoever’s at the front of store (duty managers or cashier) think there is a physical danger. This includes shoplifters. If you hear this, you drop everything including helping customers and go to assist. 

I heard the shout and being at the back of the big building, I ran to help. As I ran up the last section I spotted one of our notorious regular shoplifters (she apparently steals to order) shouting at the duty manager. Apparently she’d been acting suspiciously and when our duty manager tailed her she’d turned nasty, which is when the code got called. 

The moment she saw me belting along in all my gear, she screamed so loudly and went tearing out of the door at speed. I must have scared the living daylights out of her, enough that she dropped her bag. Funnily enough we found a cushion in it which she’d definitely not paid for. 

Weirdly I didn’t see her for weeks after (she would usually come in a couple of times a week, and we weren’t a store I’d say you’d shop in regularly as a habit).",TalesFromRetail,1986,1566625896
crispysilicon,Turns out expiration dates can be important. Or. How I met the HazMat crew!,"From a long time ago, when I first started working auto parts.

A customer came in looking for carburetor dip. (this stuff if you're interested  [https://www.berrymanproducts.com/products/cleaning-degreasing/berryman-chem-dip-professional-parts-cleaner/](https://www.berrymanproducts.com/products/cleaning-degreasing/berryman-chem-dip-professional-parts-cleaner/)  ) For those that don't know, this is a can of extremely strong solvents made for dropped a whole carburetor into. It will strip enamel/grease/carbon. It's usually sold in 1 gallon sizes, looks like a can of paint. It's also sold in 5 gallon containers, but nobody ever gets that. This guy wants a 5 gallon.

I look it up and it says we have one in stock? I've never seen it that I can think of? I head to the back and start searching.

The back of the store has the wholesale counter, and that's where I found it. Literally buried in bags of oil absorbent, with a lot of dust. I got everything out from in front and on top of it, and luckily they have a metal ring on the top to grab it by.

I grab the can and slide it towards me and then hoist it up.

The can tore apart like wet toilet paper. This stuff gushed everywhere, luckily it just got my shoes. I'm holding the top of the container in my hand staring at the massively spreading mess. Guys at the wholesale desk are freaking out, then the floor starts smoking. The fumes were extremely choking. We all rushed to open all the doors and rushed everyone out of the store.

Called 911 because those fumes were extremely harsh, they sent in hazardous materials crew. From the time of the spill of their arrival was maybe 30 minutes? Took about 3.5 hours before we were cleared to enter the store.

Lots of ruined products around the spill, but the floor was the worst. It ATE the floor. There was a distinct crater where the tile was gone.

One of the HazMat guys showed me the can, which was over 3 years past it's expiration date. Turns out the expiration date is for the can, not the chemicals.",TalesFromRetail,1671,1566577300
Kenderlend,Jailed over a pickle,"When I worked at a grocery store near me I was the one that would work the register later in the evening. Being that it wasn't a large chain store there was only 3 people in at the time. Well one night I was at the register and only one customer in the store. They didn't like the selection of some random food, I think it was rice. Well they were getting really mad at me because I was the one there in front of them. It comes to the point where they threw a pickle at me (we sell those bagged pickles up by the registers) and hit me in the cheek. I was so pissed but my manager saw it and came out to help. My manager was actually backing me up for once and is very upset with the customer. Manager asks me to go call the police since we have them on camera doing it. But before I step out to call, an off duty cop comes in and sees the customer with my manager. The off duty officer asks me if everything is okay I told her no the customer (my manager was at this point screaming at) had assaulted me and we had it on camera. She told me not to worry and she called one of her co-workers and he was there lickity split. Since I was the one attacked they asked if i wanted to press charges, told him hell yeah I do. Actually ended up going to court for it too (the case didn't go too far because it was cut and dry that they did it). So they went to jail over a pickle.",TalesFromRetail,1745,1566566792
ryanoconnor050,Woman expects me to read her mind,"So I work in a large DIY store here in Ireland and today a woman beckoned me over and asked me to help her find the paint she wanted.

So I go over and get the paint supervisor and explain to him that there's a woman who doesn't know what she wants but she's looking for someone who's more educated in the ways of finding paint based on absolutely zero information.

He walked over to the woman and began to talk to her and I could see that she was becoming more and more irate as she was asked simple questions and eventually she just stormed out of the store, severely unsatisfied with the fact that we did not know what paint she bought last week, based on the minimum information she provided to us.",TalesFromRetail,1349,1566518568
LovelyShark,"""You are here to serve me.""","This happened back in the late 90s when I was a teen working my first retail job at a popular department store.

The store closes at 9pm, there a numerous signs and announcements are made.  

At 9pm, I vacuum my area and tidy up, then do a final walkthrough to make sure no customers are still in my area of the store.  Seeing no one at 9:15 PM, I close my register and hand the money into the office.  I notice I forgot my keys, so still clocked in I return to my register to get them.  Of course there is a customer waiting at the register. 

The customer wanted to see a pair of shoes.  I told her the store was closed and the register was shut down, but I would be happy to get the shoes for her and if she liked them I would hold them for her until the next day.

""No, you are here to serve me.""

I was caught off guard by this statement, but quickly responded with, ""only until 9pm, since it is after that, I am leaving.""  

I left the sales floor, told the manager, clocked out and left.

I have worked in retail for many years (not anymore though) and have never had a customer tell me that I was there to serve them before or after this.  That comment really upset me.  I did tell my manager this before leaving, so she was okay with it.",TalesFromRetail,1782,1566485951
HellmasterBean,Now that's what I call blatant shoplifting,"Just a short one today that happened a few about ago but still makes me go ""Are you kidding me?""

I work at a discount retail store that unfortunately has to deal with a lot of shoplifting. It's a mostly found out after the fact type of thing, people stuffing things in purses or pockets. We have security devices on a lot of things but thieves will still figure out how to get them off one way or another and we end up finding broken hard tags in pockets of other clothing and such (which is a pain because it sets the door alarm off and we have to check the purchases of confused innocent customers).

We've even found blood stains on clothing from people hurting themselves trying to get tags off wtf..

But blatant out in the open shoplifting is rare and weird when it happens and it happened today on my shift.

I was cashiering and starting a large purchase for a lady when a man comes in from the 'Returns Only' line. I don't think much of it cause people never seem to pay attention to the sign that says where the line starts anyway and there was no one else aside for him and the lady there anyway. He sats down one of those great big laundry baskets full of clothing, along with a set of sheets and a comforter set and just leans against the end of my counter. He sat it down really close to the lady's stuff so I ask if they are together.

The guys just replied, jokingly. ""No, don't think she wants anything to do with this.""

I very distinctly hearing an accent I thought sounded cajun. Yeah, I thought he sounded like Gambit from X-men is exactly where my brain went.

Anyway, the lady's order is taking a bit and a few more people are now in line but not backed up very much though I do have to ask people to not line up in the return line and direct them to the regular line. Par for the course for my job.

Just as I have finished the first lady's order the door alarm goes off and I look up, expecting to see some customer has walked too close to the sensors again to the like...only the see the guy with the cute accent bolting out the door with his full basket of clothes, some of which have screaming alarm tags on them that are now going off.

""Sir?"" I call after him, followed a much much louder ""**SIR!**"" 

The second one I must have been channeling my mother's teacher voice because literally everyone in the store could hear me. But by that time the guy had jumped into a car parked right in front of the store and sped off. I composed myself, picked up my walkie and informed the manager what happened before going back to checking people out. Of course the other customers were as shocked as I was and many of them kindly stuck around to give addition details to the manager when she came up to get my account.

It turns out the guy had an at least one accomplice, his girlfriend/wife. It was actually her grabbing perfume (which are kept in individual locked keepers) off the front display and running out the door that set the alarm off in the first place. Those keepers are going to be a pain to open without the special key. In fact I hope all their pilfered goods get ruined trying to get the security tags off, idiots. Oh and because they had the getaway car right in front of the building, the security cameras probably got a good view of the license plate. Aside from that there is not much the store can do.

It was just so wild. Why did he even bother standing a line? Did they really plan this whole thing out or did the GF decided to yonk some goods and he then had to grab his stuff and run? I don't know.

All I know if it hurt my throat to yell that loud at an idiot",TalesFromRetail,1117,1566463390
iaskianswer,"""You gave bad customer service""...for knowing how to do my job from memory?","This just happened a few days ago, compared to other stories(even my own) it's not that bad, but it's still pretty frustrating since it shows the absurd standards people hold their expectations regarding customer service.

I work as a mobile representative selling prepay(think tracfone, total wireless, ect.) and postpay(contracts with most major carriers) in a big box store type location. I am not an employee of the store I work in, my employer has just been contracted out by the store to do these types of sales so unlike the people who work around me in the department I'm stationed at it is quite literally my job to know about phones. However most people assume I am part of the store proper despite the fact that my uniform is completely different to other employees and that my actual company's logo is displayed clearly on my identification card I wear at all times. This is not that important for this story in particular but it does show that I know what I'm talking about when it comes to what I do.

I had just started my shift when I had an older woman come up to my desk like she was in a rush. She starts saying how she's with X-carrier on a contract, but through an X-carrier branded store, not the big box. She noticed that we have a better deal on a popular last gen phone(it's truly a ludicrously low price for the quality of the phone) and that she wants to set up another line for it. Because she is not on an X-carrier contract with the big box store I work out of I cannot touch their account(and they cannot touch ours, they are completely different which is why we give better deals on phones) and to get the phone deal through us she would have to have her entire account transferred over to us before doing anything, and in order to do even that all of the phones she has on the account(upwards of 4) have to be completely paid off. I had actually just dealt with a similar case a few days prior and that was the same procedure we had to go through. At this she huffs and says that she was in the store 6 months ago(I have only been working there about 2 at this point) and that the person she talked to then said something different. Did not tell me *what* the person had said different, just that it was different.

From my coworker I know that 6 months ago the newly promoted ""boss"" of our location was so bad at her job that she would just lie to get sales, so I ask her if it was one of our employees or one of the store's. She says ours and gives a description that sounds similar to how my coworker depicted the old ""boss"". I tell her that either the employee she spoke with gave her the incorrect information or that in the 6 months since the last quote the policy had changed(which, while unlikely in this scenario, has actually happened in the past.) and that the only way to proceed would be in the way previously described.

The woman starts muttering quietly under her breath, says ""Ok,"" mutters more, then turns to leave. I tell her to have a good day, and she comes back and starts an almost gentile tirade about how she was ""disappointed in my customer service"" and that she was going to a different location of the store(not all of which have my company operating in them) because I told her different from what she expected. When I ask for an explanation she says, ""You didn't look anything up,(Pointing to my terminal where I make contract sales) you should have at least offered to look it up.""

Again, similar situation I had mere days ago. The only difference was that case only had one phone where as she had four.

So I guess knowing protocol by heart and informing customers of them is bad service....if you don't ""look them up""?",TalesFromRetail,1530,1566398019
Sammi0013,"Ma'am this phone is split in two, and you want me to what?","Since so many of you enjoyed my previous story and it honestly made me really happy people wanted to hear more so here we go!

It was another work day fixing phones, selling screens, people not understanding that phones have brands and versions, etc. Now for a little more backstory, my boss owns two stores in the same shopping district and when I work at one he works at the other so most of the workday I am completely alone but I am used to it so when people have problems and demand my manager I have to call my boss from the other store from the second floor now this lady was for a lack of better words difficult.

Me: Hello how can I help you today?

Lady: Hi I was wondering if you could help me?

Me: Of course! What seems to be the problem?

*Lady pulls out a sandwich ziplock bag with a phone and opens it to show me the phone* ***split in half*** *hanging by the wires inside and places it on the counter*

Lady: Yes I need you to take the pictures off my phone and save them to my google drive so I can access them

I stared at the lady shocked and pick up the phone carefully to not hurt myself and look up at the lady in disbelief

Me: Um if you don't mind me asking.....what happened? 

The lady looks away from me and huffs as if I insulted her and crosses her arms and glares to the side

Lady: I just dropped when I got out of my care that's all.

I wanted to ask *While driving?*! But it wasn't my business and didn't want to be rude so I set the phone back down and sighed as I smiled at her

Me: I'm sorry Ma'am but the phone seems to be incredibly damaged and I won't be able to get any information off this phone I apologize

Lady turns back towards me and glares as she huffs again and looks back down at the phone before looking back at me

Lady: I just told you that I dropped it I just want my pictures off the phone you need to help me.

Me: Ma'am, as I tried to explain the mainframe of the phone where this information could be, is incredibly damaged and won't be able to resurface.

Lady: If you won't help me then get someone who can!

I sighed and looked at her tiredly

Me: ...would you like me to call my boss?

Lady: Yes!

I picked up my phone and before I could call him I looked back at her

Me: He works at another store we have here and could take a while for him to get here is that all right?

Lady: Yes I can wait but get him here now!

I sighed and called him and talked to him that someone wanted their phone fixed and wanted him there he said he would be right down I ended the call and looked back at her a smile

Me: He said he would be right down so if you excuse me

I moved to the side and started to help an old man looking for a glitter case for his granddaughter which I gladly helped him with it was a good ten minutes later when my boss came down the way

Boss: *towards the Lady* Hi what can I help you with?

Lady: Yes I need help. I need to get the pictures off my phone. *gestures to the completely broken phone*

Boss looks at the phone then back at the lady before he looks at me with the most WTF face ever I shrugged and we both look at the lady

Boss:....sure

Lady looks like she won the ultimate prize and looks at me with this smug look before she hands my boss her broken phone and a number to contact her when its done she walks away and my boss picks up the phone and puts it back in the ziplock baggy and puts it behind the desk

Me: Sir?

Boss: There is no way I can do anything with how damaged that phone is. I'll call her in a week and make up some BS anyways I'll be at the other store okay?

I nod as he went back to the other store and went about my day thinking about this lady and how she wanted me and my boss to fix a completely broken phone he told me he did call her and say there was nothing he could do and she was not happy at all.",TalesFromRetail,1532,1566347418

opossumpark,Customer ruins her chance to buy a product she wanted,"This story was a while back. I worked in a discount store and a lot of makeup there would get broken into and swatched. We have a policy that we can't sell makeup that has already been swatched for obvious reasons. I was ringing and a customer (C) comes to my register,

C: I wanted to get this makeup but it is swatched already, can I get a discount on this? 

(Keep in mind that this was the last makeup of it's kind. We didn't have any more of it in stock other than the one she brought up)

I wasn't aware of the policy yet so I called over to ask my manager (M) about it. My manager looked at the makeup and came over to talk to the customer.

M: I don't believe this item is swatched, but if it were swatched I wouldn't be able to sell this to you at all because we can't sell swatched makeup. 

C: It is swatched, if you look at it you can see a finger print. Is there anyway I can get a discount on it?

Me: I do think I see it too it looks like a finger print

M: It may have been just a bump on the make up or something, but if it is a swatch I wont be able to sell it to you at all. I will have to mark it out. 

C: No look closely thats not a bump you can see the line from the finger print

This sort of exchange went back and forth for a while so I'll skip to the end.

M: Okay I believe you that its swatched. I will have to mark it out of stock now. 

C: Wait I want it can't I still buy it? I don't need a discount I can buy it at the marked price.

M: Sorry but like I said I can't sell makeup that's swatched so I'm going to have to mark this out. 

The customer was disappointed. I couldn't believe it. How did she not see this coming? She was given so many chances to say ""okay its not swatched, I'll buy it at the regular price."" Her desperate attempt to get a discount on already discounted makeup ruined her chances at being able to buy it at all.",TalesFromRetail,1487,1566217778
Alexandraisamazi,"Lady returns a gift for her mom, for a very sad reason","This is a story from today, fresh on my mind and I need to share this. I work at a department style clothing store. Same place as my other posts. I’m a customer service representative. This is the most heartbreaking moment I’ve ever had with a customer. TLDR at the bottom.

The cast are just me and the customer (C) for reference she looked around 70. 

Me: How are you today?
C: I’m fine... I just need to return this.
Me: Oh I’m sorry to hear that, was anything wrong with it?
C: *Starting to get upset and a few tears roll* No, I just bought it for my mom as a Christmas present, and she’s not going to make it.
Me: *Holding back any emotion because I just want to cry with her and hug her* I’m so sorry to hear that. You get to spend time with her now right?
C: Yeah we just had a spa day yesterday and we have been spending all the time we can together.
Me: That’s good to hear. *I give her the most genuine, reassuring, I feel your pain smile possible*

I did the return and sent her on her way with many words of encouragement. I never know what the people I interact with are going through. I just try to make everyone’s day better. I thought you all might enjoy hearing this. 

Note: The reason she returned it is that the item is a foot warmer and it’s in the upper 90’s. 

TLDR: A sweet old lady returns a gift she bought for her mom, because she isn’t going to live to see Christmas.",TalesFromRetail,1405,1566183455
LyteRay1943,No tag no sale...BULLSH*T,"(Mobile) 


One big rule in our shop is if an item doesnt have a tag or it has been ripped or obviously tampered with we can not sell it. Some people cant seem to understand that rule and think they can get it for cheaper or claim it was this one price and just expect me to put that in. Quick thing, the shoes have the price written on them, clothes and some toys have paper tags and few other items have stickers. Now on with the show.

A mom, the grandma and two kids are shopping around and the kid sees this bag of toys she wants but her grandma says no and starts throwing a huge tantrum about and screaming and sometimes even trying to hit her. They where in my line to check out and with this girl still screaming I hear the grandma say 

""you took the tag off, now you cant even get it"" 

This made this girl scream even louder and calling her a liar. When they finally came up the girl just tossed the bag on the counter and covered in tears. I look and sure enough the paper tag was ripped off. So I tell her the same thing the grandma told her. 

""Sorry I cant sell it if the tag isnt on it."" 

We went ballistic, this four year old girl screaming and crying at the top of her lungs about how ""wants it!"" And ""gimmie it!"" And my most favorite ""you're ugly now gimmie it"" 

What was the mother doing through all of this? Browsing her phone and ignoring her. I just check out her items but not easily since the girl kept trying to yank things out of my hands. The other kid who was a much calmer kid gave me his bag of toys and I check his out and that makes her cry even louder. 

""Why does he get a toy!?!?! Why cant I have my toy?!!?"" 

The grandma finally had enough and starts yanking the girl away by the arm and trying kept fighting and playing limp and screaming until the grandma finally picked her up and took her outside. The mom simply paid and left. My ears where ringing by the time they left.",TalesFromRetail,1462,1566143401
MysteriousPlatypus,Customer was upset that we wouldn’t accept his two week post-dated check,"A few days ago this guy comes through my line, with two full carts of groceries. The total came to over $700. He said he was going to write a check, and I said that was fine. We are allowed to accept checks for large amounts as long as we get a manager’s approval. So he finished writing the check and he hands it to me. 

The first thing I notice is he had post-dated the check for almost two weeks from now. 

**Me:** I’m sorry sir, we can’t accept post-dated checks. I’ll be happy to take it if you change the date to today.

**Him:** well what if I just post-date it for one week, instead of two?

**Me:** I’m sorry, we are only allowed to take checks that have the current date.

**Him:** is there a manager around?

**Me:** yes, I’ll call her over (calls for manager)

**Manager:** is there a problem?

 **Him:** yes, this cashier won’t accept my check.

**Manager (to me):** is there a problem with the check?

**Me:** yeah, he wrote it for two weeks from now and I told him we couldn’t accept it.

**Manager:** she is correct sir, store policy is we don’t accept post-dated checks at all. I see you have a large total, so I can stay here to approve it if you want to write a current check.

**Him:** I can’t do that. I don’t have the money in my account right now. That’s why I need to post-date this. I’ll most likely get paid next week, or the week after.

**Manager:** sir if you don’t have the money to pay for these items then you won’t be able to get them. 

**Him:** but I need this stuff! Can I write an IOU to the store?

**Manager:** no sir. If you don’t have the money, you don’t get the items. That’s it.

**Him:** Fine, then I guess I won’t be getting any of this! And he storms off.

This is probably one of the simplest concepts ever! You don’t have enough money, you don’t get it. Ridiculous to have to explain this to a grown ass adult.",TalesFromRetail,2177,1566077355

Me: Ma’am. I’m sorry but yelling at me doesn’t solve the problem here. 

Me: I understand that it might cause a little inconvenience but like I said earlier we have to examine the condition of any clothings before accepting the request, this is to protect our customer and also the company in case something happens during the washing process. 

W: Fine. Here! 

Me: thank you. 

W: I’ve never seen such a rude service before!

redzero77,Woman claims bottle return receipt is hers even though it isn’t,"So in Germany, they use the bottle return system which means you pay 25 cents more for a bottle and then get the money back once you bring the bottle back.

Anyway, I asked the lady if the receipt was hers (6€) and she said yes, so I collected it. After I handed out the money, the woman next in line complains that it was hers (after not being able to find hers). So I ask the first woman (Karen) if it was really hers and she says in an uncaring voice that she had one somewhere. 

The woman next in line says the exact amount on the receipt and it turns out it is hers and Karen just couldn’t be bothered. I had to pay the 6€ out of my own register.

Goalie_deacon,"It doesn't matter what NY law says, you're in MI.","Early in my grocery retail job, I worked third shift (over night), at a 24/7 store, as in we were always open.  We slowed down around midnight, but still had a few customers till about 3 am.  After that, the store would be very quiet till about 7 am.  Most of the people shopping around 2-3 am were people who were going home from bars, because by Michigan law, all alcohol sales stop at 2 am.  Our registers would not scan any alcohol the moment the clock read 2 am.  We had several incidents of customers getting mad because they would get in line at 1:55 am, and didn't get rung up in time to get their beer.

Normally I stocked the shelves, but sometimes I had to work the register if the cashier called in.  This happened on one of those nights.  I had a steady pace of customers, nothing unusual.  Then two young men walk up with a case of beer at 2:30 am, along with a few small items.  Right away, I tell them I cannot sell them the beer.  They don't believe me, because they think they can buy till 3 am.  I explain the law says 2 am, and I cannot sell.  They chuckle, and say ""Come on, we're from New York, and we can buy till 3 am.""   I replied, ""But MI law says 2 am, I cannot sell.""  One of them goes on, ""Look, we're from NY, the law says 3 am, you can sell us the beer.""  I demonstrate the register will not scan and allow the sale, and say, ""Look at this, the register says I cannot sell to you.""  We go back and forth a little longer, and I see a local uniform cop get in line behind them.  I continue for a moment to give the cop a sense of what is going on, then I say, ""Well, if you hurry really fast, maybe you can get back to NY by 3 am.""  Cop speaks up, ""Yeah, I would like to see that.""  Both guys look at the cop, look back to me, pay for the non-alcohol items, and leave.",TalesFromRetail,1612,1565916532
cire3172,A customer made me cry today,"I started working at a major department store about 3 weeks ago and this is my first retail job.  

Me: Me
C: Customer 

Today, I was working the cash register in the older women’s clothing department. A customer comes up to pay for her store credit card bill. She hands me $80 and I ask is this how much you want to pay and she says yes. Then she has to approve the amount on the signature pad. 

I finish her transaction then hand her receipt and she asks, “Where is my change.”

Me: There is no change you handed me $80 and told me you wanted to pay $80.

C: No, I only wanted to pay $78, that’s how much my bill was. 

Me: Ma’am I’m sorry but I can’t see how much your bill is and you also verified the amount on the signature pad. If you pay more than the amount on your bill it goes towards credit for the next month so you aren’t losing any money. 

At this point she begins to raise her voice at me. 

C: Why would I want to pay more than my bill. I want my change back now. 

I’m still fairly new and I never learned how to cancel a completed transaction. I try to call one of the managers but the phones aren’t going connecting. Then, I decide I should ask one of my co-workers for help. 

Me: Could you wait one moment while I go and ask for help to get your change?

Then the customer starts to yell and berate me. She tells me I’m stupid and it’s going to be all my fault if she can’t get her money back. Around this time, my eyes start to tear up and I go find a co-worker to help her. The woman pays her bill for around $78 and gets less than $2 in change. 

After the customer leaves, I went into the bathroom and cried about it. Then, my manager spoke to me and told me I handled the situation poorly, even though I had tried to call her. 

TLDR; A customer yelled and berated me because of a mistake and caused me to cry. My manager then verbally reprimanded me.",TalesFromRetail,1661,1565830982
sandersseptickit,A woman refuses to pay for a bag of cherries she ate from then put back.,"Hello fellow redditors! I’m called Kit and welcome to my first post on here and oh is this one amusing…to me anyway. It definitely was not for my boss at first haha! Though she did laugh about it afterwards, a bit hysterically, but still. This is a bit long by the way so strap in and enjoy the ride.

I work at a store (obviously or I wouldn’t be posting this here) and it was just me and my lovely boss working. It was a long but uneventful day, so we only needed us two to get through the last few hours and close the store.

In the last hour or so of store time a woman came in. She was a regular customer (that is kind of important in this little tale) that always came into the store to buy donuts in the morning, so it’s not like we didn’t know her. She was maybe around seventy or eighty as well which kind of makes this tale even more baffling to my boss and me.

I had been boxing down like normal, going around the store and grabbing boxes off the shelves that were empty if you didn’t know, and my boss called me up to the front office. I was kind of confused and thought that maybe she just needed to see what aisle I was in and whatnot. Oh boy was I wrong.

She looked absolutely flabbergasted, and not only that, she looked so mad that even her face was turning red in anger. My first response to this sight? I grinned. I knew something was up because she was a relatively calm person that didn’t let much get to her.

As soon as she saw me, she strutted up to me and was wagging her finger in that universal ‘come here’ motion with a mad half grin half grimace.

Her first words were, “I need you to stand in the office as a witness!”

I was kind of baffled but at the same time amused at the way she said it since, as I said, she seemed partially hysterical at the time. Seeing the look I had, she went on and explained.

“I’m going to tell off this woman in here,” she said as she points towards the back and around the store, “nicely. She grabbed cherries, took two handfuls, and is currently spitting them all around isle one!”

At this the amused grin was wiped off my face and replaced with astonishment and a disappointed “Seriously?” was my reply at the absurdity of the woman. At this time, I hadn’t known who the woman was nor how old she was, but she had coincidentally decided to make an appearance from behind the chip isle in the back of the store right after my statement.

Immediately my boss pointed to the woman and sure enough, I recognized her. She was at the store every day, every morning I should say, and should know better than do something so disgusting. That was something you scolded a child for, not a woman that should clearly know better!

My boss and I waited up front, her getting people through check out, and me waiting in the office for the woman who was just la-de-daaing through the store and taking her sweet time looking around.

My lovely boss was still ranting about the woman, quietly, to me the entire time. I’m sure that if she wouldn’t have, she would have lost her cool and all professionalism would’ve gone out the window when the woman finally came up.

And come she did. The woman took her time unloading her things out of the bag she carried with her so there were a few people in line behind her that heard what was said as well. One of them was a regular at a bar by the store funnily enough. He is someone to remember here soon. The conversation went as follows:

“Your total is $ ma’am.” My boss said to the woman.

The woman nodded and reached into her purse to grab her money and that’s when my boss grabbed the bag of cherries the woman had put down after grabbing two handfuls out of it. She presented them to the woman and asked, “Would you like these as well?”

The woman looked up at my boss, baffled for a moment. “Why would I want those?”

I couldn’t hold back the grin on my face as I watch the scene unfold. The customers behind the woman looked confused.

My boss smiled. “Because you already ate a third of the bag.”

The woman seemed a little irritated but didn’t show much. “I only ate two of them to try,” the woman replied.

My lovely boss grinned and put the cherries down on her register to weigh them and turned to the calculator she had beside her.

“Ma’am,” she said. “This bag weighs 1.59 pounds, it’s supposed to weigh 2.03. That’s a .44 difference in the weight. You ate more than two.”

The woman was scowling now.

“Are you going to pay for that bag?” My boss asked.

“Why would I do that?” the woman asked blandly with a slight scowl.

I looked at her dumbfounded. Even the customers behind her were shocked. We thought this woman was nice, but we now know the truth.

“Because you ate a third of the bag ma’am,” my boss replied clearly annoyed but still calm.

The gentleman behind her that was a regular at the bar then spoke up. “That’s like me drinking half a Mountain Dew then putting it back because I didn’t like it or want it!”

The woman seemed kind of dumbfound now, giving my boss a look that she was the one being rude while the others in line leveled the woman in what I could only describe as a disappointed stare.

“Okay if you won’t pay for the bag, will you pay for the ones you ate?” my boss asked. She was still the picture of calm and her voice was level. She was even smiling at the elder woman as she asked.

Finally, the woman complied, and she forked up the cash for the cherries she ate. It’s amazing what goes through some people’s heads.

Anyways, thanks for reading my lovely experience! See you in the next tale if there is one. Then again it’s retail, there’s always a story somewhere.",TalesFromRetail,605,1565798932
Boaty2399,"""Yeah, I don't wear deodorant""","Hello everyone
So, after watching a reddit video where people complained about smelly customers, I decided to share my story, hope you'll enjoy it!

A little context:
I moved to the UK last September for Uni, and in November I started working for a clothing retailer in my town
The shop is fairly big (3 floors) and my role is to support it all, meaning I don't have a specific department, I get moved according to where I am needed for the day

Now, onto the story
After my probatory period of 2 months, management had decided to keep me in the Ladies' section
During the day in which this story took place, my job was to take the clothes that customers had left in the fitting rooms after trying them on (if something didn't fit, you could leave it with the shop assistant at the exit of said fitting rooms) and put them back on display

So, since I had been working during the week days for my probatory period, I didn't know the weekend staff, nor the tremendous surprise that was waiting for me

Well, my shift starts, I take care of some clothes that had been left in the stockroom and then I enter the fitting rooms to get the rest
And oh boy, the worst smell I had ever smelled in my life hits my nose
It was like... I don't even know exactly how to describe it
Have you ever opened a full trash bin during the summer? Well, something like that

What made everything even worse is that the area where the unwanted clothes were kept was a small room (usually very hot too) with no ventilation
I tried my best not to gag at the smell, got a few chlotes and then left the fitting rooms as fast as I could

After a few hours of this, I finay gather the courage and go talk to one of the other employees
Me: ""ehm... Am I the only one that smells this weird odor? Do you smell it too?""
She threw a quick glance around and then whispered to me ""yeah, it's the girl that works in the fitting rooms, she's what causes this smell""

I was shocked
I felt miserable just for being sweaty at the end of the day, how could she live like that without feeling horrible?
After speaking with a few other colleagues, I found out that the situation was even worse than what I thought

So, usually we have 3 people in the fitting rooms during the weekend:
One stays at the front desk (our smelly girl in this case) and two stay in the small room mentioned above to get the unwanted clothes and make sure they are in order and ready to be displayed again

The smell was so bad, they had to contact management first, and HR then, to speak to her about the issue
She refused to listen to them and kept on with her smelly routine
Apparently, they couldn't do anything about it, so she was free to go on

At this point, management decided to take a small bottle of perfume and put it in the fitting rooms
Said bottle was to be used whenever she was around

This ordeal went on for a few months untill, finally, a few weeks ago she resigned and started working elswhere
After she left, the fitting rooms kept smelling for a good two weeks, untill the only thing left to remind of her was the half empty bottle of perfume

What shocked me even more, however, is when last week, during a shift, I was chatting with a colleague about her and she told me that she not only didn't care about her smell, she was proud of it, so much that during her first day of work she had announced ""Yeah, I don't wear deodorant""

So yeah, this is my little story, hope you liked it and thanks for reading",TalesFromRetail,1796,1565792040
Elkeid,I can be rude too,"A little background: I used to work in a store that sold all kinds of cheap items, kinda like a dollar store but a bit more upscale. This store sold everything from office supplies to kitchen supplies to toys. During my time there, I was a shift manager.

This story happened about 6 years ago, around Christmas. Christmas was always a very busy period, something about cheap toys really lured the people in. Anyway, it was a tuesday morning and I was in the store alone. One of my colleagues had taken the day off and, because I didn't expect a very exciting morning, I had scheduled myself to be alone in the store, with a colleague coming in in the afternoon to reinforce me for when it got busy. 

In comes this man in a pretty expensive looking suit. This guy looked incredibly out of place compared to our normal customers. Hair slicked back, shoes polished so well you could see your own reflection. With him is his son, an equally well-dressed and groomed little individual. Suit-guy and his child stroll around the store and eventually suit-guy makes his way to the register, where I'm at. He's carrying something from our sale section, which is filled with damaged items or items we're trying to get rid of.

Me: Goodmor...  
Suit-guy: How much is this? (He says as he shoves a box in my face)  
Me: Alright... let me check for you.  
\-I ring up the item-  
Me: That's €5.   
SG: But it's damaged!  
Me: I'm sorry sir, it's just the box that's a bit dented, that's why it was placed in the sale section. It used to cost €30.  
SG: I don't care what it used to cost. It's damaged, I don't want to pay full price!  
Me: But you won't be paying full price... it's been discounted from €30 to €5. (pretty generous for just a dented box btw)  
SG: Well, I won't be paying €5, give me a better deal!  
Me: Sorry, but I can't do that.

SG then goes off on a rant about how I'm being unfriendly and rude, how well he's connected and how he'll make sure that I'll get fired and never get a job again. Sure thing Mr. Idle Threats, sure thing. At this point, any semblance of a retail smile melts of my face and I just tell him to go ahead with all those threats and also inform him he's no longer welcome in our store. I ask him to leave before I have to call security. He says he's going to get his son and leave. 

About 10 minutes later, SG is still in my store. I've called security but they were (I learned later) busy with a violent shoplifter in another store. After browsing around for a while, SG and his son come up to the register and SG's son puts down a toy they want to buy for him.

Before I go on, I just want to say that I'm not exactly proud of what I did but I'd do it all over again if I could.

I look at SG and I look at the toy and SG tells me they'd like to pay for that. I look back at SG and tell him ""I'm not going to help you after what you just said to me."" I took the toy and put it behind the counter ""Now, please leave  like I asked you to do earlier"" 

SG gets furious. I learned some new curses that day. After a couple of minutes of him yelling at me, he storms out of the store with his kid, who's now in tears over not getting his toy. You try to threaten me and my job with idle threats? I'm going to fire back however I can. You could say SGs son was innocent in all this and I should've just sold them the toy but I wasn't in a caring mood at that point.

I did get called up by my supervisor a couple of days after, SG had called corporate and had filed a complaint against me. After telling them my side of the story and reviewing the camera footage of the incident, my supervisor sided with me and told me I was in my right to kick him out of the store and refuse further service.",TalesFromRetail,974,1565778203
s317sv17vnv,I know what you’re looking for. We still don’t sell it.,"It’s occurred to me that some customers (usually older ones) seem to think that the item they are looking for will somehow materialize if they give us as much of a description as possible. A few examples:

An older couple stops me as I’m supervising the sales floor, and the wife asks me if we sell LED candles.

Me: No ma’am, unfortunately we don’t sell those, but I reckon [redacted] may have what you’re looking for!

Customer: LED candles, like for memorials.

Me: Yes, I figured we were thinking of the same thing, and as I said, we don’t sell them.

Her husband then holds his phone up to my face. The screen showed a picture of an LED candle.

Me: (internally screaming) I know what that is. We definitely don’t sell them.

A few minutes later, I saw the couple speaking to one of the salespeople, who had a look of HELP on his face.

There was another time a few weeks later while I was at the top of a ladder looking for something on a high shelf, when I heard the faint sound of a voice saying “Lightbulbs?” After I heard it two more times, I looked around to figure out where the voice was coming from since I didn’t hear any salesperson responding, and I saw an old lady standing next to my ladder looking up at me.

Me: Oh, I’m sorry ma’am, I didn’t realize you were speaking to me. (because you just said “lightbulbs” instead of “excuse me” or something that usually gets someone’s attention) How can I help you?

Old lady: Where are your lightbulbs?

Me: I’m sorry, we don’t sell lightbulbs. You could try the pharmacy across the street perhaps?

The old lady reaches into her purse and pulls out a lightbulb to show me. “Lightbulbs like this kind.”

Me: (internally screaming I KNOW WHAT A LIGHTBULB IS WE JUST DON’T SELL THEM AND CLEARLY THE LIGHTBULB IN YOUR HEAD IS A BIT DIM) ... We don’t sell lightbulbs of any kind.

It’s like some people think that even after we’ve said with certainty that we don’t have what they they need, their asking multiple times each time with greater detail than the last will somehow make us suddenly realize we have a secret stash of them somewhere.",TalesFromRetail,2199,1565739155
hate_doublee_standar,Lady walks out the store because the express lane isn't good enough for her,"I work in a grocery store and am just coming off my break, my colleague had to go on his 15 min break so I took over from him in the self-checkout then it was only me and my Supervisor left on the floor at that moment and it was getting busy as. Self serve was busy too. In my Supervisor's queue in the express lane (its built into the service desk where the Supervisor runs), there’s a lady with a full trolley who’s folding her arms looking around and R.I.P. she makes eye contact with me.


&gt;”excuse me can you open a register?!? You’re doing nothing”  

 &gt;“I’m sorry I can’t leave the area, we’re down by one colleague he’s on his break, we have no one else, he’ll open up for you when he comes back.” 

&gt;“that’s not good enough how long?” 

&gt;“err 10 mins..you can just go through the express lane its fine” 

 &gt;“I don't want to be served through there, I want a full checkout, that’s ridiculous I want to speak to the manager”

 I was spared answering because someone tapped me on the shoulder for Self checkout intervention. Actually, 5 flashing red lights I was certainly not about to just drop my stuff and leave to open a register and Supervisor was stuck too serving the customers in express.  

Colleague came back from his break and she just vents at him, he even offered to just open a register  for her but she said 

&gt;""no I’ve had enough, I’m walking out, I’m done here, goodbye, have fun putting my stuff back"", 

and she leaves her trolley and walked out, and my mouth starts curling into a smirk.

When it the busyness piped down a bit, the Supervisor said 

&gt;""Don't worry if she makes a complaint, its on her, she was offered to be served through express but that wasn't good enough for her... its like getting a free meal and complaining it didn't come with sauce""",TalesFromRetail,1107,1565705680
ajupeach,I got harassed for $2,"so I work at a grocery store in the bakery department. I have been in the bakery industry for a while and I really like my job. I’m lead in the afternoon shift, so I deal with a lot of rude customers. Im used to rude customers and I really don’t get that bothered by them anymore. 

This one day, I went to work and start my shift at 2PM (an hour before the rest of my coworkers), I set everything up the cashiers area and start. Around 30 minutes after, everyone is getting there and I get a customer asking for a box. he points at a box with cookies in them so I assume he wants the box of cookies. I tell him where the cookies are located and goes to them. he comes back saying that he just wants the box and that I should be fired. I thought he was just joking so I laughed and said that I misunderstood and reached to get boxes from the box. we usually charge up to $2 for the boxes for bread because we use bags for bread and the boxes are only for our cakes or packaged bread. I tell him that the fee will be $2 for the box. keep in mind, I’ve dealt with people who will take a lot of bread so the box is necessary or they are just really nice to me  so I don’t charge them or discount it. but oh no, this man started screaming at me saying im bullshitting and that im a liar. also I was never rude to the man or anyone (Im actually in a good mood when im working tbh) but a lady that was with the cashier wanted to chime in and insult me but thankfully, her. daughter got her to be quiet and told her to not get involved and that I was just doing my job. but this man started screaming at me that he wanted to speak to my manager, so I said okay he’s coming right now. my manager got back from wherever he was and I told him what happened before the guy got to him. and he said that it was fine and that he’ll handle it. I keep doing my job and there he goes, telling my manager that I am charging him for the box and my manager agrees with me that its store policy. oh but the guy started screaming saying that its a stupid policy and that he’s never heard that before in any other store. while this man was screaming at my manager, I was fixing tables out on the floor and I had to pass by them. he deadass started telling that im young and stupid but I just  ignore him. my manager stopped me and told me to just give the man the box for free bc he was annoying him. I agreed and kept doing my job.

this man went to me at the tables and was asking me “how old are you? 17? 18? 19?” and all I responded was “old” and he kept harassing me and then I told him that I was just doing my job so why is he still bothering me? and he deadass said he knows I am but im still too young to know. he also told me “maybe you should go back to school, you’re too young and a girl could never know about good business” (its summer my dude. I go back to college in a sec) I actually got pretty upset and told him to stop talking to me and get away from him before I do something that will get me fired. I know I shouldn’t have said that but I don’t get mad easily and this man was in his late 30s to his mid 40s so he should know better than to be harassing a girl for $2. I didn’t report him to anyone (which I might if he comes back again) and get him ban from the store.

moral of the story, I got harassed for $2...",TalesFromRetail,884,1565685273
twiggy572,Return Policy,"My boss had a family emergency and asked me to cover his shift this weekend. I decided to help out (they have all been super sweet to me over the years) so I said yes. 

If anyone hasn’t read any of my other posts, I used to work at a small local toy store. Some other background for the story:

We do a Dutch Auction sale where certain products get marked off to a certain discount and after a bit whatever is left gets discounted even more. We also have a 30 day return policy that is labeled on any gift receipt we give out and the date of sale is written on the gift receipt. 

A customer walks in with her kids. The girl has a craft kit and is trying to exchange it. At this point, I was handling another customer and a younger coworker was trying to help. She peels off the gift receipt (without paying attention to any of the details) and scans the item. The item turns out to be one of the Dutch Auction items that is labeled as Final Sale. My coworker gets confused by the error on the screen (as it was saying to not accept the return) so I walk over. I extend my apologizes and said how it was final sale and it was never supposed to have a gift receipt in the first place. The woman is mad and is saying how that’s BS that her daughter came in expecting to get something new. She was also bullying my younger coworker so I really wasn’t trying to go out of my way to make an exception. I told her I can bend the rules just this once, but I could only give her the amount it’s valued at in our system currently for store credit ($6). She reluctantly agreed and walks around the store with her daughter. 

I asked my coworker what the date on the gift receipt was and she said it was 7/21 (less than a month ago). Finally, she comes back up and starts complaining again how there is no way her friend only spent $6 and how we are just trying to pocket the money. I explained the sale and how while she did not buy it for $6, it is now valued at that. Again, I try to apologize for the confusion, but she starts to focus her anger on me. I tell her how I was not the one who made this mistake and I’m apologizing on part for whoever did, but she’s just not budging. She’s trying to force me to tell her what the full value was and she looks over the register and sees that it was originally $32.99. 

She then decides that $6 wasn’t enough and wants to take the gift back (with the tossed out gift receipt) so she could contact my manager about our policy and about me. My coworker said that she tossed out the gift receipt and the lady starts yelling how it was “so convenient” that she tossed it out. I told my coworker to just make a new one with the date that was on it. My coworker goes to write 7/21 and the lady starts yelling again. 

Lady: “It wasn’t 7/21! It was 6/21! You guys should pay more attention to your gift receipts because it says right there that we can exchange an item if it has the gift receipt.”

Me: “Oh miss. I didn’t see the original gift receipt, but under that line about the exchanges, it clearly says you only have 30 days to make an exchange...”

Basically the woman goes from potentially getting $6 back to $0. I talked to my boss about it later and I said how I could have made a personal exception at that point and gave her the full value in store credit, but with the way she was behaving I wasn’t going to. My boss agreed with me especially after hearing that multiple customers walked over to me after and apologized on that woman’s behalf.

ask-me-about-my-ween,"A customer tried to lie about an interaction with me, to me.","So im a custom framer in a craft store.  
  
I had a customer come into my shop and she asked for a gold frame with a green mat to go with her painting. I said ""ok"" and started helping her out on finding the exact ones she wanted. It took over an hour and a half but she left saying she was excited about getting it because she loves the design and how it looked in the mock up on the computer.  
  
She comes in to pick up her art when its ready and honestly i was excited for her to see it. I *loved* the way it came out but instead i got ""oh... Hmm.. I cant say i *love* the green"" shot through the heart! But its whatever people have a change of mind unfortunately though ... ""im sorry to hear that but if you want to change the mat you will have to buy a new one which can be about 60 or so just for the mat alone""  
  
""Well i guess ill live with it"" she says and leaves with a pout   
  
I was disapointed she was unhappy but unfortunaly we have customers sign paperwork that says ""i agree to the above design and that if my art gets fucked up in the process the store owes me"" and i cant just be handing out mat replacements because they changed their mind on the design as much as i wish i could.  
  
Next day I was working and the store gets a call ""hi, yeah i came in yesterday to pick up my art and im just.... Not happy with it. Im looking at the paper work and it looks like there was a mock up of my art on a computer but the framer never showed me the screen and honestly I felt rushed the whole way through with her.""  
  
I recognized the voice and only had one unhappy customer the day before so ""is this [last name]?""  
  
It was quiet for a second probably because i knew who she was but i finally got a ""yes""  
  
""Ok, so in the framing manger and the framer that assisted you for your order. I never have the computer facing me directly when working with customers as well as you nixed some mat colors based of the computer image alone as well as we spent well over an hour so I can garuntee you werent rushed.""  
  
Again it was quiet until ""well im just not happy with my piece then.""  
  
""Im sorry youre unhappy with your choice but unfortunately you signed a form stating that's the look you wanted and its what was given any changes you want done comes at a charge. I can give you a 50% discount but we wont replace it for free.""

AG:Yesterday afternoon, my son was smoking, I asked him where he got them, he said here. How could you sell MY SON cigarettes? He's not allowed to smoke.

M:If you can tell us the exact time he purchased them, we will check the security camera and see which staff member we need to report to the health department.

AG:I don't know exactly when he bought them, YOU need to find that out and fire whoever it was.

M:Come into the office, we'll go through the security footage and you can show us who your son is.

gwiazdala,"“You broke my phone!” “Sir, I held it in my hand for five seconds...”","I work in retail selling phones. We get a lot of people who need technical support come in with no intent to buy and just do a little bit of troubleshooting, especially in our area because it’s a lot of older folk. Well a while back this middle aged guy speaking Spanish (enough English to hold a conversation) came in with his wife and asked me to get her email back on her phone, as they’d accidentally removed it. The phones are the same model, about five years old. He tells me they share an email, so I ask him what the username and password is and he doesn’t remember either one. No big deal. I ask for his phone, pull up the settings and find the email, type it for him on the wife’s phone, then pass it to him to reset the password and sign in. He does exactly that, it works, I hand him his phone back then they leave.

The next day he comes in without his wife, holding both phones. His is super hot to the touch, and according to him hers is “acting strange.” I first take his phone and check to make sure there’s no suspicious apps downloaded, no malware, and that he doesn’t have a million tabs open or anything that could overwork the battery. Everything seems okay. Then he says “They were working fine until we came in yesterday.” I just kind of nod in agreement, because yeah, they were fine. And move on.

Then as I check hers he says it again. “We had no problems until we came in yesterday. I’ve had the phones for years without issues but suddenly they’re messing up.” Now I’m slightly annoyed because he seems to be implying I’m at fault. I say “Well all I did with yours was open the settings to see your email username. I didn’t download or change anything.” And then he gets quiet. I’m going between the phones and suddenly he points out my Puerto Rican coworker and asks if she can come over to speak with him because he’s more comfortable speaking Spanish and she’s fluent. I find that odd because he never seemed to struggle with English beforehand, but summon her anyway.

As I’m turning the phones on and off I notice his phone isn’t hot anymore, and nothing seems to be wrong with his wife’s besides general slowness. I mean they’re old as hell. and look like they’ve been dropped a few times, iirc one of them was cracked in the front. But then he starts talking to my coworker, and I can understand enough Spanish to hear him basically telling her that I deliberately did something to their phones that messed them up. Very firmly I interject and say to him, “Sir, I did not mess up your phones.” He looks at me for a second and then continues talking in Spanish to my coworker, like he no longer speaks English. Basically ignores me.

I eventually get rid of him by saying that I took some apps off and freed up room on the phones, and suggest giving them some time to test out any differences, otherwise replacing the batteries might help if they don’t want to upgrade. He leaves. I ask my coworker what all he was saying, and she says “Oh yeah, he says you broke the phones. He wants you to be held accountable. He just kept saying variations of that over and over.”

Like man damned if you do, damned if you don’t. I was just doing what he asked me to :c",TalesFromRetail,1120,1565483477
crispysilicon,"Snow chains, after hours and the price of being nice","Years back I worked auto parts somewhere at a decently high altitude. It would snow feet at a time some days. This was one of those days.... That had ended.

It was 9:38pm. The store had closed at 9:00pm and I had finished running the end of day tasks and counting/deposits. It had been snowing all day this day, about a foot now on the road, a few feet on the dirt and still accumulating. Already chained up my Supra earlier for the ride home.

I exit the store and lock the doors and as I do, a truck pulls into the parking lot. It's a big Dodge with dual rear wheel and a snow plow on the front. He pulls up in front of the store and looks at me.

Plow Driver: I know you're closed, but I need tire chains, please!

Me: I just closed man.

Plow Driver: I know, I understand, but I need these chains or I can't plow the roads tonight and I will lose my contract! Please, I'm begging you!

Me: \*sigh\* Okay, fine, I'll help you out. But it's going to take a while. 

So I reopen the store, call alarm company. Check inventory, do have his chains, and proceed to sign in a till and sell him two pairs (dual rear wheels). He goes out the door, and I start re-closing the store. Another half hour later, I'm ready to go out the door again. It's about 10:45PM.

He's still in the parking lot. I lock the doors again, and he stands up from under his truck, covered in snow, looking defeated. The chains are NOT on the tires. 

Me: You okay?

Plow Driver: No. I have no idea what I'm doing and I can't get them on.

Me: What? You drive a plow and don't know how to put on chains? \*I think this is pretty funny\*

Plow Driver: I don't normally drive, I own the company. My driver called in and I had no choice. Replacement can't make it. If it doesn't get plowed, we lose the contract. I'm already more than a hour behind schedule. I don't know what to do.

Poor guy looks like he's going to cry. I sigh again, because I know what I'm about to do, and I'm not going to enjoy it.

Me: Move over, I'll do it...

I crawl under the damn thing and chain it up, takes about another 40 minutes. I'm cold, wet and can't feel my fingers but it's done. 

Me: Alright man, you're good to go, good luck.

Plow Driver: I don't know else to thank you, but I hope this helps, it's all I've got.

He stuffs a bunch of bills into my hand and I stick it in my pocket.

msellierose,Sign this note to say you're a terrible employee!,"Not my story, but my friend’s. 

My friend, L, worked at a discount store in our small, bogan town. It sold general household things, arts and crafts, stationary and the like at pretty cheap prices.   
The store had very few employees, and my friend was receiving close to full-time hours each week. So I’m pretty sure she just did not care about trying to please crazy people. 

She was working on the till and had just scanned this particularly customer’s (C) item. 

L: That’ll be $10   
C: $10?? But it’s less at (a different discount store)!   
L: Sorry, but it’s $10 here   
C: I want it for less!   
L: I’m sorry, we don’t do price match.   
C: Get me your supervisor.   
L: I am the supervisor   
C: Where’s your manager??   
L: They’re not here today.    
C: Well then you’re going to give them this when you see them.   

The customer then whips out a pen and notebook and quickly scribbles a note. She then hands my friend the note and the pen and says “Sign this.”   
According to my friend, the note read “L would not give me the item for the proper price. L had terrible customer service and was extremely rude” and then C’s name and number.   
My friend stared at her for a few seconds, figuring out if she was serious, before simply saying “No”  

C: I need you to sign this and give it to your manager!

Claervel,These sausages are too hot.,"So, this happened about 5 years ago, back when I was working in a supermarket. We had a customer come into store asking to speak to a manager to make a complaint and to get a refund on a product that she'd bought from us. She complained that she had burnt her mouth on some sausages that she'd bought from us because they were 'scalding hot'. The manager was sort of worried at this point: we may have been selling our cooked deli products too hot, causing burns, which ultimately could lead to someone claiming damages etc. 
The manager asked her some more questions to try and find out more. It quickly became apparent a few minutes into the conversation that the woman had bought uncooked, chilled sausages from us. Had taken them home. Cooked them herself. Then came in for a refund because the sausages were 'too hot'. The confused look on the customer's face as my manager explained that if she cooked them at home then the temperature of the sausages was her responsibility was priceless.
Needless to say, she did not get her refund.",TalesFromRetail,2041,1565300612

LongLiveMisanthrope,I think I won that bet.,"So years ago, I worked in a very large home improvement store. One of the largest in our company, in fact. 

I was hired as a cashier but was quickly put in charge of returns as I was quick to assess problems with the items, but was slow at ringing them up, and nearly refused to answer the phones due to not liking to talk to people on phones ( I have since gotten over this). But working returns in a home improvement store means that I meet every stupid person that walks through our doors. Something to know about me, I am fairly quick witted and my name may explain how I generally feel about people.

Anyway, I was working one day, everything going normal when a seemingly well-minded gent walks in a bunch of spare parts. The meeting begins with the normal introduction of how can I help him, moving on to him explaining he was repairing his house and had left over parts that were unused.

Just quickly looking over them they looked like they were in perfect condition so I began to scan them into our system. Our system, in short, checks if we sold this product at our location in the last 2 years first, then after we scan the receipt, gives us the price and method of repayment. Bing bam boom, job done.

Except for the fact that everything I scanned said that it wasn't in our system. I apologized to him and asked for the receipt. He pulled it out of his pocket and handed it to me, saying he only bought it last week and we should be able to give him a refund. I look at the receipt and indeed it was purchased last week, but I cannot refund him still.

Customer: Well, why not? 

Me: We do not sell these items here, sir.

Customer: Yes, you do. I bought it last week. Look at the receipt.

Me: Yes, sir. But if you look here-

Customer: Just give me my money back.

Me: I can't. If you look here-

Customer: I don't care. Just scan my stuff and give me my money back.

Me: \*frustrated from not being able to get a word in to explain\* Here, sir. I will make a bet with you. \*pulls out my wallet\* If you can find the items in our store and get me the sku# for them that matches the ones on the receipt, I will refund the full price. AND I will throw in $10 of my own money for you. Sound like a deal?

Customer: \*taking his things forcefully back\* Sounds like free money to me.

Thirty minutes later: Customer sheepishly wanders back and mumbles something about how all of the items are different now and how he had a hard time finding things.

Me: Want me to explain why now?

Customer nods

I pull back out his receipt from his bag and hold it next to my vest. On my vest there is the store's logo (one that is house shaped) next to my name. And on the receipt is another logo for a competitor (one that is a square). He looks at them back and forth for what felt like an entire minute before I see the bulb click above his head.

He doesn't say another word, just motions for his receipt back. He then tries to go out the entrance... which is a one way automatic door. He turns back confused to see me already pointing in the direction of the exit.",TalesFromRetail,1240,1565214758
JollyMorgan,"I think, therefore you must be open","This story happened a couple of years ago, when I was working in a store that sold new-age-y stuff. I didn't believe in that stuff but $ = $. I had also developed a new-age persona for interacting with customers but that's a story for another time. As a result of what we sold, most of our customers tended to be pretty chill. 

It was a Sunday afternoon and our store closed at 17:00 on Sundays. Most of the time, we'd have some stragglers, which never bothered me because I had to close up and clean anyway, meaning I didn't leave until 18:00. Most of the time, I would just lock the door at close and I'd have the stragglers out by 17:30 at the latest. On this fateful Sunday, however, we had a straggler (lets call her Descartes, or D for short) that kept looking around until 17:45, when I decided it was time for her to leave because all there was left for me to do was vacuum the floor and go home after. The following conversation happens:

&gt;Me: I'm terribly sorry but I'm going to have to ask you to leave as we closed 45 minutes ago.  
D: But I thought you were open until 6!  
Me: Sorry, but that's when we close on Monday - Thursday. Today we close at 5.  
D: Are you sure of that? (no, lady, I'm not. I've only been employed here for 2 years...) I'm sure you're open until 6.  
Me: No, ma'am, we really close at 5 today, it says so right on the door -points at sign on the door- I don't mind you staying a bit past closing but it's almost 45 minutes later and I really need to close up.  
D: Well, I thought you were open until 6, so I am staying until 6!  
Me: That would be trespassing...  
D: I don't care! I thought you were open until 6! So I am staying until 6!  
Me (dropping my store-persona): You can keep repeating that but that doesn't change the fact that we're closed and you need to leave the store right *now*.

Finally, it sinks in that she should leave and the lady storms out... face first into a locked door. It took me a couple of seconds to compose myself so that I could unlock the door and let her out.

Me (giant retail smile): Have a lovely day!

I burst out into laughter the moment she was outside. I decided vacuuming could wait till the day after and went home. Sure lady, just because you think we're open until 6 magically makes it so.",TalesFromRetail,1835,1565091912
Mr-E-Droflah,I want a full refund on my contract as you changed my ringtone on my phone.,"So this was about a year maybe more-so ago but I was just reminded of this as I listened to the old style Video call from a video. You know that high pitched *TWEEEHDELELELELELEEL... TWEEEHDELELELELELEEL* so yeah I used to sell mobile phones for a particular brand in the UK. This brand in particular seemed to attract a certain type of character. I’m at the front of the store, not too busy and low and behold an angry customer (AC) bee-lines for me. This is how that conversation went.

AC. *Angry tone* I suppose your company believe it’s right to alter my settings in my phone do you?

Me. *thinking it’s probably a software update* ah sometimes things can change on there, if you pass me the phone I’ll have a look to see what’s happened.

AC. What? No! You don’t need to see my phone! You need to stop messing with settings on my phone and actually let me use it. *he does this weird smile as if to laugh in my face but not quite making it there* What gives you the right to change my settings?

Me. Well the manufacturers usually release software updates over time to help the performance of the phone...

AC. I haven’t had a software update! I have seen my phone TRYING to do that but I won’t allow it. What I am saying to you is to not alter my settings.

Me. *by now I’m a little bewildered and it’s clear this guy is pretty much shouty yell, not giving a change to actually help him* so... can I just ask then what has actually changed?

*He takes his phone and goes onto video call, rings a name on there and places the phone in front of me. It’s making that low pitched DRRRRRRR ringtone and he keeps staring at me the whole time*

AC. What is that? How are you meant to hear that?

Me. Well I get what you are saying it’s not that loud and...

AC. *interrupting* You see you admit it wasn’t the best idea was it? So now when I get a call or even ring out I cannot hear it. And the whole point of a phone, I’m sure you young ones won’t know this as you have been brought up with this technology (I’m33 M with a baby face at the time probably 31. He was staring to go light grey over his dark grey so probably 40s or 50s) So why have you changed my phone so it no longer provides me the service I was GUARANTEED to have?

Me. Well this is something you will have to take up with the manufacturer as we only provide the service but can repair or replace if the phone is faulty.

AC. *stares at me mouth open for a second* Sorry? I have to go to the manufac... you SOLD me this phone in good faith. Now I am telling you that you have changed my settings you are passing that blame?

Me. Well we don’t change any settings on the phone.

AC. So what do I pay for? I spend over £40 a month and you feel you can change my settings? It’s not good enough.

At this point nothing I explain to him is getting through to the fact that a Newark has no control over how the manufactures will update phones or change settings etc. Because I couldn’t put his settings right in the store, also because I took another new phone out and set it up so he could hear the change he suddenly demands a full refund.

Thankfully as I had recently just stepped back from management position to the sales I could explain to the manager on duty what was going on. It was kinda nice seeing cocky new management buckle under an angry customer after giving me grief previously for stepping down but afterwards we laughed about it and I don’t work there any more. The guy didn’t get any refund and I don’t know if he ever contacted the manufacturers to complain but never heard back from it again. Just love unreasonable customers and happy to look back at being retail free for almost a year now.",TalesFromRetail,838,1565050254

Sjcunniam,Customer won't let me remove stock from shop floor,"Here's a bit of back story:

I work in a chain shoe store, I'm a secondary supervisor and I'm only in charge when my manager and supervisor are both off. Now on a Thursday every store gets list from our head office of stock they want us to send back to the warehouse for a variety of reasons, we call this recall. The recall can only be put through as a transfer the day before the scheduled delivery for that week. Our delivery just so happens to be a Thursday, so we usually have plenty of time to sort it out, and anything that needs doing is usually done by the Tuesday ready for it to be boxed with a transfer note on the Wednesday.

Now to the story:

This happened in a week my supervisor was off due to the  school holidays. I was off the Monday and Tuesday as I had worked the Sunday which wasn't my normal shift. Anyway I got a message from my manager Tuesday evening explaining that she'd been unable to sort any of it out as the shop had been extremely busy. I said it was OK and I would somehow manage. I absolutely hate recall when I'm in charge, its extremely stressful to do when it's busy.

I went in the next morning and went through my usual routine of getting the store ready to open. I finished this at about 8:50, so I had about 10 minutes before I had to open. Karen was already waiting outside but I refuse to open the doors before 8:58 as I don't get paid for those extra 10 minutes. I  go about my jobs keeping a close eye on the time.

Eventually I open the doors and finish opening the shop. Karen storms in  obviously annoyed that I didn't open the shop sooner. Customers are usually grumpy at this time of morning and 9/10 times buy something that makes me think why do you need that first thing in the morning. This Karen was no different as she was looking at sandals. I start sorting out the recall, most of it was sandals as the company was starting to make way for winter stock. There was a lot of it and I mean a lot, about 50 pairs of shoes, had to bagged labelled and boxed up, more than half of it sandals. Yup you guessed it right where Karen was looking.

I decided to sort out the rest of recall hoping that by the time I'd finished she would have gone, or bought something. Sorting the rest of recall took me about an hour as I had to be on the till, help customers and keep the shop tidy all on my own. Now at 10 am Karen still hadn't bought anything and was in the middle of trying some sandals on. I checked the shopping centre and it was getting pretty busy and there was no way I could wait to do the recall. This is where the mess started.

I started to removing some of the sandals. Karen came up to me and said ""Excuse me I was looking at those""

Me:""sorry I need to send these back to the warehouse""

K:Yes but I was looking at them can't you do it later

Me: I'm quite happy to leave the ones you want to try but I have to take the rest

Karen: No you'll get in my way.

Me: I'm sorry I need to get it done as soon as possible, otherwise it'll get too busy

Karen: If it gets busy it can just be done tomorrow.

Me:No it can't. If you need me I will be at the till.

I walk away from her, not giving her a chance to respond. I keep going back and removing more sandals, until I have all of them on the list. This however does leave quite a few gaps and Karen being a typical Karen complains.

K:How am I meant to shop for sandals when, you've removed them all.

Me: I'm sorry, that you can't find what you're looking for, but we do have limited stock here. I can have a look on the till for you and show you pictures of stock I can order in for you.

Karen: what about those? ""Points to the ones in the box""

Me: sorry they aren't part of our stock anymore. I did say if you wanted to try them on, I would leave the size with you, but you didn't ask.

Karen: I'm asking you now! They are in your stock they are right there!

Me: I'm sorry for the inconvenience but I did tell you what I was doing when you spoke to me. I'm sorry for the inconvenience, I can have a look if any of the near by stores have what you want.

Karen: I want those!

Me:I'm sorry they are not for sale, I waited for as long as possible.

Karen: I want to to speak to the manager.

Me:I'm in charge today, I can give you the customer services number if you wish to talk to someone else.

Karen: That's a lie!

She takes the number anyway and storms back out the shop,knocking my collugues little girl over on the way out. I get a phone call from customer service about 30 minutes later asking my side of the story, but nothing came of it.

Hope you enjoyed it.",TalesFromRetail,1562,1564942832
supersmileys,We waited...and we waited...,"I work in a liquor store.

One Saturday afternoon, one of our regular customers came in to buy some alcohol. He usually came by maybe once a week. Nice chap. He had a trolley with some bottles of wine on the top tray and a box of beer on the lower part of the trolley. I scanned everything, boxed up his wine and he paid and went on his way, wheeling the trolley out to his car. 

Later on, I went to grab a trolley to bring it inside and there was a box of beer left on one. It was the same beer that the customer had bought earlier. I went and checked the cameras, and sure enough the man had wheeled the trolley to his car just outside the store, put his wine in the back of the car and wheeled the trolley back, forgetting the beer on the lower tray. 

No worries, I thought, he’d likely be back once he realised. I told my manager what had happened and reprinted a copy of his receipt and made a note at the counter so that if he came back we would give him the beer he had left behind. 

He never returned that night, but I figured he was usually in most weekends so we left the receipt with the note up the front for when he came back. 

Well. The weeks came and went. Each Saturday I’d come into work and the receipt would still be there. He hadn’t come in. I double checked with my coworkers - they knew who the customer was, it was just that he hadn’t been in since he left the beer behind. It was rather disheartening. 

The receipt stayed up the front for about 6 weeks. Maybe he moved or was on holiday? But after that period of time, the receipt was removed, I guess my manager figured that he probably wasn’t coming back, or that everyone knew who he was in the case that he did come back. 

Then last weekend I came into work and my coworker told me “he came back!” My coworker didn’t figure out who he was at first until he saw the beer he was buying and said to him “did you leave some beer behind last time you were here?”

It clicked - the customer told my coworker that the next day he had gone to his fridge for a beer and there was none. The customer figured that he had just forgotten to buy it and thought nothing more of it. He was pleasantly surprised to find that there was a ‘free’ box waiting for him. 

But alas! He finally got to take home his beer! He was happy, we were happy :)",TalesFromRetail,1840,1564702017
angelofthemorning4,No you can't have it for a cheaper price just because you set it down on a table with a price you liked more.,"This happened last night and I still can't believe someone could do something so brazen. 

I work at a clothing store that caters to a specific age group and always has discounts going on. This couple comes in and is browsing. They eventually come to check out and I start ringing them up. A couple items ring up at just under $5. They say they got the clothes off a table with a price of $4 each. I tell them somebody probably put them in the wrong spot but I'll ask my manager if she can do anything. (I figured she couldn't but people tend to listen to managers over mere peon cashiers.)

She comes over and I tell her what's going on. She says she can't price match them because they were different styles. They say fine and decide they don't want them but seem a little upset about it.

After they pay and leave my manager tells me she wouldn't have price matched for them anyway. Her reason for this? She saw them pick the items up, move them from their original table to the cheaper table, walk around for a few seconds and then go pick them back up. They didn't know she had seen them do this and she didn't say anything to them about it, but I couldn't believe people would do something like that. (This is my first retail job.)

crispysilicon,"I once had to give a customer some really, REALLY bad news. Then the FBI showed up.","So yeah, years back I was working as wholesale manager for a large national auto chain. This chain also had a full service repair facility. When the service manager needed to leave, the technicians would come to me instead. This was one of those days that ended like no other....

I remember it was a hot day, well over 100\*F, a little after 2:00pm. I'm sitting at my desk looking for some part when one of the technicians comes up to me. His name is Kenny.

Now, Kenny is a real nice guy. He's in his early 50s, Vietnamese and has a great sense of humor. His English isn't great. He understands everything, but never quite got the hang of putting it to words, but he does fine given a minute. The man always has a smile on his face and he's an outstanding mechanic. I'd let him work on my car, and that's a real short list. Anyway...

Kenny: Mr. Silicon, you need come with me. Right. Now. \*he's stone faced, and he *always* calls me by my first name\*

I'm more than a little scared by how he looks. I'm thinking a vehicle has fallen off a lift, or someone is seriously injured. He leads the way to the service bay. He works in the bay all the way at the end, and that is where he takes me. On his lift he has a 200? white Ford Expedition. He guides me to the front passenger wheel well, the wheel and tire have been removed and are on the floor. Then he points up to the fender.

I stick my head up into the wheel well and look up towards the fender, and there it is. A large plastic and taped wrapped package, clearly containing a white brick. It's very large, like 8""x10""x3"". It's heavily taped to the inside of the fender.

I look at Kenny and he looks at me.

Kenny: Cocaine.

Sure as hell looks like it to me too. 

Me: What is here for? (the truck)

It's a lot of work, practically all the front bushings, ball joints, and outer tie rods. Vehicle is listed at \~78,000 miles.

Me: Do you know who this belongs to?

Kenny: No.

Me: Alright, just head back to the office, don't touch it.

I head to the service desk and pull the repair order. It's got a local phone number and address on it. I ask the service adviser who the customer is, he points to the waiting room next door. I peek inside.

Inside is an early 30's guy and his two kids, maybe 7 &amp; 5? Looks nice enough but you never know. At this point, I called the local police. I told them what we found, gave them the vehicle information and customers name. They said stall him for as long as I can, they will be there as fast as possible.

I head inside the waiting room. Introduce myself to the man, and tell him it looks like he might need a few more parts. I say the sway bar bushings and links could also use replacing. He looks at me for a second, then smiles.

Guy: Yeah, it's okay, if it needs it, just get it done. I've got time.

His kids are real nice too, they both introduced themselves to me, very polite.

Me: So how long have you had it? 

Guy: Only a few weeks! I just purchased it from auction down south.

Me: Really? What kind of auction?

Guy: Government seizures! DEA I think? I got an amazing deal. The thing is beat, but I can afford to replace the parts for the price and the body and inside is great.

Me: ....

Me: Man, I've got some *really* bad news for you.. \*I start to explain\*

Right about this time the local police arrive. They also have the local FBI with them. They examine the vehicle, and have Kenny put the wheel back on. Vehicle goes onto a flatbed and away it goes. Two of the FBI came with me to the waiting room where this poor guy is now freaking out. 

Turns out it was indeed a DEA seized vehicle. And they had MISSED THE HUGE BAG OF COCAINE IN IT.

They had to seize the vehicle from him, couldn't just take the drugs out and give it back, like gonzo, and no repayment. Unknown if he would ever get it back. Poor guy was devastated. Last I saw him the FBI was giving him and his kids a ride home in their SUV.",TalesFromRetail,4446,1564615690
QueenFrankie420,The customer who tackled a thief,"I've worked in retail for a dozen or so years so I've got plenty of stories. Good bosses, bad bosses, stupid bosses, good customers, bad customers, Karens and straight up thieving vagrant druggies.  We have policy after policy to deal with various situations but fact is a lot of theft happens because of policies that are there to protect us (workers) from getting hurt. One of our policies is that we cannot chase thieves out the door.

This was a while ago so details might be off.

I was cashiering this day, don't remember if I'd been covering a break or was on all day. For reference, my register is right next to one of the entry doors and there's a half wall blocking customers from being able to walk behind me and out the door easily. This is supposed to help prevent theft.

I was ringing up a line of customers when I heard a commotion behind me. A younger male (20's) with a receipt in hand and a box of shoes was on the side of the half wall closest to the doors and an older male (50's? Gray hair) was on the other side. The gist of the argument was the older man telling the younger man to tell the cashier he didn't pay for the shoes. The younger man waved the receipt at the older man and said something about it then stepped closer to the security sensors by the door. An alarm inside the shoe box which should have been removed at purchase by whatever cashier rang up the customer started going off.

I started out by assuming the best of this guy, I offered to remove the security tag my coworker left on if he'd give me the box and receipt. I walked towards him, hand out. He waved at the receipt at me and stepped backwards away from me, obviously not going to give me either. This flags him as a thief. I ask again, telling him he won't be able to remove that tag easily but I can take it right off for him if he'll just hand them to me.

He took off running. I shrugged and headed back to what I was doing (re-no chase policy) and the next thing I knew, this older guy jumped over the waist high half wall, and ran after him, tackling him just outside the doors, and he wrestled the box out of the guys arms and brought it back in saying ""I hate fucking thieves""

I was shaken up, but moved on. He came through my line later and explained they were shopping and came across him back in one of our other departments trying to remove the tag from the shoes. When he realized there were people on the aisle he was on he moved to another area and kept trying but this old guy just kept following him around until finally the guy just tried to walk out with the shoes.

So thank you, random old guy!",TalesFromRetail,932,1564597771
JollyMorgan,"No, you can't block our entrance","This story happened a couple of years ago. At the time, I was working in a store that sold mostly new age-y stuff. I didn't, and still don't, really believe in that stuff and I don't think my boss did either. Anyway, the money was good and there wasn't a whole lot of work to do on an average day. I also had developed a persona for talking to customers but that's a story for another time. 

On this particular day, I was checking stock on some necklaces we sold because I had to order new ones. The necklaces were right next to the entrance so I got to see the approaching customer in all her glory. The particular customer (Let's call her LA for Lance Armstrong) came racing in on her bike - almost knocking over someone on the walkway in the process. You see, LA had ignored the handy bicycle lane and instead had chosen to use the much more crowded walkway. 

Because our city loves cyclists, the street our store was on had a lot of places specifically designated for parking bikes. One of which was right next to our store. LA chose to ignore these as well and instead parked her bike perpendicular to our store's entrance, leaving barely enough space for her to get in. I got to her as she was locking her bike.

&gt;Me: Excuse me, ma'am, would you mind moving your bike to one of the designated spots? Or, at the very least, move it so it doesn't block the entrance?   
LA: I just need to buy one thing! It won't be there long!  
Me: Regardless, I'd appreciate it if you moved your bike. It's blocking other customers from coming in.

This prompted LA to unlock her bike and get back on.

&gt;LA: Fine! If you don't want me as a paying customer, I'll go to \[new age store that closed 4 years ago\] instead!  
Me: Good luck! 

About an hour later, the phone rings. It's LA but she doesn't recognize my voice. She goes off on a tangent about how one of our staff members barred her from entering the store FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER. 

&gt;Me: Ma'am, I was the one that requested you moved your bike. I never barred you from our store, I just wanted you to keep the entrance free for other customers.  
LA: I want to talk to your boss.  
Me: Sure. -hands phone to boss-

My boss takes the call and I continue what I was doing; I had already explained what'd happened with LA and we both had a good laugh over her going to a store that'd been gone for over 4 years. Afterwards, my boss tells me that LA had made some crazy accusations, none of which she believed or even took serious. When my boss told LA that she didn't believer her, LA cursed at her over the phone and threatened to call corporate... on a privately owned store with only 5 employees. Boss wished her good luck with that.

Now, this is where the story should've ended. BUT THERE'S MORE. LA came back to the store 2 days later. I recognized her by her parking her bike in front of the entrance again. This time, with my boss' blessing, I did actually bar her from the store and told her she was more than welcome to come back if she parked her bike in the designated area AND if she made an apology to both me and my boss. LA left and I haven't seen her since. She did leave behind a nice review on our Facebook page in which she referred to me specifically as being friendly and very helpful. Just kidding, her one-star review was filled with more of her lies and a lot of name calling aimed specifically at me. She even referred to me as ""the wicked witch of the store"" and I wore that sh\*t like it was a badge of honour for the rest of my time in the store. At my boss' request I got to leave a reply on the review, including video footage of her parking her bike in front of the store.",TalesFromRetail,1695,1564544524
indecisivecrybaby,Customer tried to return something to the store she bought off of me on Facebook Marketplace,"I used to work at a popular teen girl clothing store. I loved working there, and I was a big fan of the clothing styles even before I worked there. 

There was one shirt that was very well known from the brand that was popular on tumblr blogs and Instagram influencers, and I fell into the hype. The shirt came out a few years ago and is known as the ""yellow honey shirt"" - a yellow oversized cropped t-shirt with ""honey"" embroidered in gold thread on the upper left chest. Very basic, but very cute. I bought the shirt before I started working for the brand, and even wore it to the job interview.

Flash forward a couple months into working for the store, I realize just HOW popular this shirt is. Even though it came out a few years ago, it is still in production. The whole honey craze even translated into the brand making ""honey"" tank tops, hoodies, sweaters... etc. Whenever we'd get a new shipment, it would be sold out within hours or two days (depending on the shipment quantity). We'd get daily inquiries about the shirt. Needless to say the style is super popular and I got tired of hearing about it and seeing it. 

I decided to sell my honey shirt because I didn't even feel good about wearing it anymore. There were no flaws except for a small hole on the brand tag where the price tag was attached. I posted it on Facebook Marketplace while I was on my way to the store for a shift. Within a few minutes, someone messaged me about buying it. I arranged to meet up and sell the shirt right before my shift started, and she agreed. I initially asked if she could meet me right at the store, but she said she felt uncomfortable doing that because she didn't want to seem ""sketchy"" and be seen by employees in the store. I knew it didn't matter because I wouldn't care and neither would my manager... I spent my own money on the item, and what I do with it is my business. Still, I agreed to meet somewhere else closeby in the mall because I just wanted this shirt GONE, and if it made the person feel more comfortable that's fine.

I grabbed a bag to put the shirt in - it happened to be a bag from the store because I purchased something about a week before - and headed to the meet up location. The bag was a paper bag and had a little rip on the top but was still fully functional. I thought it was fine because she was buying the shirt, not the bag. The girl was pretty punctual and the transaction was quick and easy. She walked away and I walked to the store for my shift.

This was an opening shift on a Sunday, and there aren't usually many customers at this time. Guess who the first person to come in was? The girl I sold the shirt to! I smiled and said hi, not to greet her but also to acknowledge that we'd seen each other literally 5 minutes ago. She looked at me and her expression changed. She then asked me, ""do you have anything burgundy?"" I was a little thrown off because I thought she would say something about our interaction that happened minutes ago, or say something about being surprised that I work there, or SOMETHING. Instead she didn't seem to recognize me. I shrugged it off because maybe she had a bad memory or maybe it was the lighting that made me look different and I pointed her towards some burgundy sweaters we had. She left the store and I moved on with my day.

I worked as a cashier the next day as well and didn't think about the incident anymore. We got a rush of customers, so instead of one of us being a cash, two of us were. About halfway through my shift, the girl from yesterday is holding the paper bag with the same rip on the top. She came with a friend this time. Initially she was lining up in front of my colleague's cash, but my line opened up and I was the one to help her. 

I was really confused when she pulled out the shirt I sold her from the paper bag I gave her with a store receipt. I asked how I could help her, and her friend said ""Oh, she bought this a few days ago and she just doesn't like it anymore. She wants to return it."" I look at the girl with the shirt and she had a blank expression but wide eyes. I picked up the receipt, and it indeed said she bought a honey shirt 6 days ago. I picked up the shirt and knew it was the one that once belonged to me that I bought 3 years ago because of the same exact hole in the brand tag. Our return policy is for 2 weeks for unworn, tags still on merchandise that you can get store credit or exchanges for, no money returns.

In the moment I was still very confused on how she attained a receipt for the shirt, and then I realized that she probably did buy a shirt from the store but was trying to return the older used one. I knew it was mine, so I told her that. She didn't respond. I asked if she still had a shirt with the price tag on it, and she said no, this is the one she wanted to return. Her friend likely had no idea what was happening, or if she did, she didn't realize I was the one who sold a shirt to her. Eventually, they left and I didn't see the girl for months after.

TL;DR: A girl bought a popular shirt from a store, finds the same one used on Facebook Marketplace for cheaper and buys it. She wants to get her money back for the initial shirt by returning the used shirt so she would get to keep a brand new shirt at a discounted price. Little did she know that the girl she buys the shirt from Facebook Marketplace happens to work at the store she is trying to return the item to. She tries to return the shirt right after purchasing it off FM only to see the same girl is working there and pretends not to recognize her. She attempts to return the shirt again the next day to a different cashier but gets the same one. The cashier denies the return request and now she's stuck with two of the same shirt.",TalesFromRetail,1990,1564496934
Ohigetjokes,But that's not how the other guy did it!,"Apparently I've developed a reputation around here as the guy you hand a customer off to when you're sick of them. I'm comfortable with awkward situations, mostly because I get bruised and scraped around here so often the idea of being punched doesn't phase me. 

Plus, I really don't care what people think of me. That's less about healthy self-esteem than it is about a basic contempt for all mankind. 

So yesterday the manager comes out back where I'm receiving in stock:

""Hey can you hook up this guy's trailer for me?""

""Ya, sure.""

""Just so you know, he was super nice until I got to the part about getting an emergency phone number for someone who wouldn't be with him. All of a sudden he flipped, going: 'Why didn't they ask me for that last week' and 'This is an invasion of privacy' blah blah blah.""

""Oh great. Thanks for that, I'm sure this will be lovely.""

I walked out to find a white bearded gentleman in khaki shorts and safari hat half way through hooking up the trailer. He was doing it wrong, but with great angry enthusiasm. 

Since he's clearly hot under the collar I decide to get real cold.

""Hi. Those chains are on the wrong side. Let me handle it for you.""

I start hooking him up and, as expected, he launches into a tirade:

""Why is it that last week they just used my office number for the emergency contact, but today the lady says it has to be for someone who isn't with me?""

I don't even look up.

""She's right. It does.""

""But why did the young man let me...""

I cut him off: ""First of all, never ask why. People who ask 'why' aren't looking for a solution or even to actually understand, so let's just not do that. It's pointless. And second, sounds like you got one of the new guys.""

This is all said while I continue with my hookup. I don't look up so I couldn't tell you how he reacted.

He's quiet until I stand up.

""Are we done? Can I go?""

""No, I need a picture of the hookup to show I did it right and then we need to check your lights.""

""But the young man last week didn't do that!""

""Guess I was right then; new guy,"" I say tapping at my phone.

We stand there in silence for a bit while I wait for the network to catch up with us. It's obviously killing him to wait, which makes me smile a bit. Finally I'm ready to tap on his name in the list and take the picture.

""What name is it under?""

""O'Whateveritwas! It says that name on the contract!""

Oh, we're raising our voices now are we?

I freeze, look at him with raised eyebrows, and quietly say: ""Do I look like I'm carrying a copy of your contract?""

I wait, unmoving. The tension mounts until he retreats into his truck.

He's on the road about 60 seconds later and I head in to let my manager know what happened so she can deal with the eventual customer complaint I'll be ignoring.

I think it's the heat.",TalesFromRetail,2522,1564429378
tattooedAngel21,We closed 11 minutes ago and you’re still trying to come in?,"The store I work at closes at 6pm on Sundays. Around 5:50 I turn off the music, count one register down and close it and I close the gates in front of our big windows. If it’s 6pm and there’s customers inside, I’ll lock the door so new customers won’t come in. Then I let an associate open the door for the remaining customers inside when they want to leave. 

It takes about 15 minutes to close both registers (which is why I close one a bit earlier) and I’ll have the other one open to take purchases. After both registers are closed I have to fill out paperwork, a deposit and do the sales for the day. If anything we get out at 6:20pm if no one is in the store, if I have a few customers left it’ll be around 6:30pm. 

So, today, the last customer left around 6pm ish. I started to count down the register that hadn’t been closed. And guess who comes to our thankfully locked door. A GROUP of customers. There was about 6 people in that group and they kept tanking at the door. I told them we were closed and they just looked annoyed and walked away. Then two more customers tried coming and I told them the same thing. 

I hate customers who come in last minute or freaking five minutes before closing to shop for 30 minutes and mess up our recovery. I’m so glad I’m finally a manager so I can decide when I can lock the door and stuff.",TalesFromRetail,2872,1564379169
yellowlemondrops,Lady goes nuts over a homecoming dress in front of daughter,"So I used to work at a department store chain that has since gone bankrupt. The final months of the store being open were especially the hardest, because rundown stores attract...interesting people, to say the least.

I worked in the apparel department and most of the time, my work was easy. However, there’s one particular day that sticks out to me:

I get called down to the register for a price check. A woman is buying a homecoming dress for her daughter, and she’s telling the cashier that it’s $15.99, not $35.99. I go up there and scan the tag with my scanner, only to see that it indeed does ring up $35.99. Okay, cool, sometimes our signage could be incorrect so I walked back over to apparel to check. 

The rack that particular dress was on had a sign that said “Any dress priced $40.99 now on clearance for $15.99.” Not the exact prices but you get the idea. The dress this woman was holding was on the same rack, but on the opposite side, in which everything was normal price, as the sign on that side explains. I pull out my store phone and call the register and tell the cashier. She says “okay” and I move on to something else.

After hanging up, I hear screaming coming from the registers, and out of the corner of my eye, I see this woman and her daughter storming over to me. Pretending not to see them, I try to hide myself because this was the last thing that I wanted to deal with.

Woman: “Ma’am. MA’AM! Can I speak with you?”

Me: “Yes, how can I help you?”

Woman: “It says RIGHT THERE that these dresses here are $15.99!” 

Me: “All the dresses on this side here are on sale for that price, but that particular dress is on the other side here, and it is currently being sold at its normal price.”

Woman: Continues to spew her thoughts onto me as I pull out my walkie talkie and call for my manager.

My manager comes over and greets me and the woman.

Manager: “How can I help you?”

Woman: “YOU PEOPLE MUST HIRE SOME INCOMPETENT EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THESE PRICES ARE WRONG!!”

Manager: “Do NOT speak to her in that way.”

This lady throws her dress back on the rack and stomps around in circles throughout the area to find a new one. She’s mumbling under her breath, swearing incoherent nonsense. She picks up another dress, marked $14.99, and holds it in front of my face.

Woman: “SCAN IT.”

I scan it and it rings up...$12.99. Another incorrect price, although this one is lower than shown. Upon hearing this, she demands a corporate number. My manager is now asking her to leave the store and to stop bothering me, stating that pricing is completely out of our hands and there’s no reason for her to be mean to me.

Woman: “Am I being mean to you?”

Me: “I’m not going to answer that question.”

My manager then tells me that I can go ahead to go to another part of the store and hang out for a bit. From what I heard afterwards, the lady found a dress, saying “I hate it,” but purchased it anyway. Daughter looks very distraught the entire time. 

Oh, the joys of retail. While yes, our pricing system and organization was not the best, I had no control over that and was just a clueless 16 year old when I worked there.",TalesFromRetail,1884,1564320393
MasterMirage,'Can't you do that later? It's offending my nose!',"So it's a Friday night and our place is open until 21:30 We do our usual last order calls 10 minutes prior - everyone is all good for the night so we start packing up and cleaning down the house.

At this point it's 22:50 (1 hour and 20 minutes past closing) and there's one table left at the front of the house. We've pretty much done all our usual tasks so we start vacuuming and mopping down the back.

5 minutes into doing this, one of the ladies at the table raises her hand and gestures someone to come over so I drop my mop and walk on over.

Me: Hi there, did you need something?

Lady: Yes, that thing you guys are doing there, it's offending my nose.

Me: Oh the mopping? I'm sorry you find the smell unpleasant, it's a mixture of bleach and detergent that we are required to use to kill any bacteria on the floor.

Lady: WELL I DO NOT LIKE IT, CAN'T YOU DO THAT LATER?

Me: Unfortunately not, we're closing up shop very soon and this is the final task for the evening.

Lady: So you're saying you're using this unpleasant smell to make us bugger off is it?

Me: Like I mentioned, this is our final task for the evening and we have a lot of staff needing to go home. We're already past our closing time so unless you are happy paying overtime for the staff then they will need to finish this task asap.

Lady gets a bit flustered at this point and I go back to mopping. The table eventually asks for the check a few minutes later and makes a comment about customer service.

BoboMcGraw,I really hate hagglers,"I work in a charity shop. We occasionally get a few problem customers, rude people, shoplifters, and hagglers. 

A woman brought some perfume to the counter. It was a good brand, still in its box, priced at €15. She wanted it for €10. My manager happened to be present and told her no, she wouldn't get a 33% discount. The woman claimed €10 was all she had on her, but was told again that she was not going to get the perfume for €10. 

Eventually, and I think mostly to get her to leave, she was told she could buy it for €12.50. So miraculously she managed to find another €2.50.

But she didn't leave. She returned with a jumper priced at €5 and a second miracle, she found another €4. She asked if she could come back and pay the remainder later. I told her no, she had to pay in full up front. Her third miracle, she found the €1. She could be a saint.

Then, displaying an amazing lack of self-awareness, she said ""Well, it's for a good cause"". Though apparently not good enough to pay full price for anything.",TalesFromRetail,1854,1564225717
sharkteethies,sure I'll price check that shirt from my car,"Just had the mist surreal experience leaving work today.  For a quick background my store is currently having a sidewalk sale for anything that's been hanging around for a while, or is damaged or opened, ect.  Every item has a different color sticker on it that corresponds with a different discount amount.

Everything started normal.  I left the building after my shift, got in my car, backed out and almoooost pulled forward.  Almost because suddenly there was this teenage girl (TG) waving her arms in front of my car.  Thinking maybe I had a flat or something that she wanted to tell me about I rolled down my window.

ME: Hey, something wrong?

TG: No! I need help! 

Now, I'm a huge paranoid worrier, when someone says something like that to me I immediately think the worst.  What happened to this girl? Is she being followed or harassed? Is she lost? Does she have a flat? 

ME: What happened?

TG: Oh, I want to know how much that shirt costs. (She points over to the sale area where someone presumably who is friends with her, holds up a random shirt).

ME: You want me to-I'm in my car, I'm leaving! 

TG: But you work here right? You left out of that employee only door.  The guy working out here is busy with someone else.

I'm like, dumbfounded at this point.  This customer chased me down to my car to ask the price of something.  At this point I'm just more tired then angry, and I figure that just answering her question will be quicker then getting into an argument, and it'll help my swamped coworker out.

ME: What color is the sticker on the tag? 

TG yells over to her friend, friend yells back blue.

ME: A blue sticker means it's 40% off, there's a poster out that gives the breakdown

TG: Okay but how MUCH is it?

ME: What does the tag say?

TG: $10

At this point I don't know if I want to laugh or cry.  She can't figure out what 40% off of ten freaking dollars is and this conversation has gone on way too long.  I don't even know WHY I'm still at it.

ME: It's six.

TG: What if I gave you five? Can you take that?

ME: Miss, I'm in my CAR.  I'm not ringing anyone up I'm on my way home!

TG: Ooooh right, So can I tell the other guy you said it was fine?

ME: No... I'm going to roll my window back up, good luck.

I work in a supermarket which has a plants and flowers section. In spring we sell a lot of bedding plants, and you get about six flowers in that for £1. 

Last summer, an elderly man approached me and my manager and said he had bought some bedding plants they year before and they had not taken to his garden so he wanted his money back. We told him we couldn’t do returns for faulty items unless he actually brought the item back to us, as per our policy.

feckinghellm8,I Witnessed my First Grown Man Tantrum,"Just for context: I work in a woman's clothing store.

A few weeks ago I had an older gentleman come into the store to do a return for his wife. Okay, no problem, we do it everyday.

I confirm he has the right receipt and that's when I got down to the bottom. I saw that the date of purchase was beyond our 30 day return period. This means that he gets his return back on a gift card and for what it's coming up as today if it's less than the original purchase price. So the item he was returning was bought at 20% off but was now 40% off, and had about a difference of $9.

I explain this to him and he wasn't having it. He said it doesn't make sense, he has the receipt, others stores don't do this etc. We've all heard it before. I once again reiterate our store policy.

Obviously he wasn't relenting so I had the assistant manager come over. She explained the same thing I just did, and he kept arguing with her so eventually we brought over the store manager. She told him the same thing all three of us did. No matter how much he argued my manager would not give him what he wanted.

He eventually got fed up, took the item back and proclaimed that they're not making another purchase at our store in the future, then proceeds to stomp away and slam our doors open on the way out. In a store full of women.

crispysilicon,Man loses $6k cash in my store,"So many years ago, I'm having a pretty uneventful day at work when the phone rings.
It's a customer who was in the store an hour and a half-ish before. He asks if anyone found any money in the store. How much money are we talking about I ask. His answer, about $6,000. It's the proceeds from his car he sold just a few hours ago. Also says that if found he is happy to give a reward. I tell my coworker and we scour the place, but no luck.
The guy on the phone is disappointed, but is positive he must have dropped it here, asks if it's okay to come search. Be my guest I tell him. 
He shows up about 40 minutes later, spends an hour plus searching and researching the store. Nada. Finally he gives up. Says it just wasn't meant to be. Buys a soda for the road. Walks out the doors and throws receipt in garbage can outside doors. Then I hear him yell. 
I see him reach out to the garbage can and pick up a thick stack of money right off the top. He's literally dancing in joy. He accidentally threw it there with his last receipt. No idea how.

Phexler,"""This kindergarten math is too difficult for me!""","I used to work at a gas station in a big city. This gas station had an automated car wash, which was the source of most of our customer grievances. In the winter, we had to close the car wash if the temperature fell below -18C (about 0F), otherwise with everyone trying to get the salt off their car and the doors being open constantly, the water pipes could freeze and burst.

So, it's 5pm, it's dark out already, it's -20C, and I just got around to closing the car wash. This annoys most people and I never hear the end of it. But one lady was understanding, or, so I thought...

Both my co-worker and I have a line of about five people, and next in line for me is this lady in her mid-30s.

Lady: ""Hi, I got the sixty dollars on pump three, and I would like a car wash.""

Me: ""Right, well, unfortunately the car wash is closed right now because of the temperature, but I can still give you one and it will be good for six months. Sorry about that.""

Lady: ""Okay, sure. That's fine.""

Me: ""Okay, so, my boss came up with a deal that if anyone buys a car wash while it was closed due to the temperature, they get a $3 discount. This discount also stacks with the $2 discount you get for buying more than 25 liters (6.5 gallons) of gas, which you did. So, whichever car wash you want, it will be $5 off!""

Lady: ""I don't understand...""

She looks a little confused.

Me: ""I... Okay, you got more than 25 liters of gas, so you get $2 off any car wash.""

Lady: ""Right.""

Me: ""Right! So, you also get another $3 off any car wash because the car wash is currently closed due to the cold weather.""

Lady: ""Oh, okay.""

Me: ""Yeah! So that means you get a total of $5 off.""

Lady: ""Well, hold on, where are you getting the $5 from?""

At this point my mind just goes blank in disbelief. It's *basic* math. How does she not understand that 2 + 3 =5? Maybe she's just had a long day at work and is exhausted. That's okay, I'll just ring up her total. 

I keep my cheerful, friendly demeanor, and ask her which car wash she would like. She picks her car wash and I give her the total price. But she looks very confused now.

Lady: ""Hold on, that's not right. Shouldn't it be [this price]?""

Me: ""Uh, normally, yeah, but you get the $5 off, so--""

Lady: ""Where are you getting the $5 from??""

Lady is visibly annoyed now. And I'm running out of ways to politely explain how toddler's math works. I look over at my co-worker, who is clearly trying not to laugh while serving his customers. He gives me a subtle glance that clearly says, ""Good luck with this one!""

I look at lady again and fumble over my words.

Me: ""You... well you get... $2 off... and... $3 off, so... you get $5 off, y' know? Heh.""

Lady now looks like she is trying to comprehend time travel and astrophysics simultaneously. She slams her purse down on the counter.

Lady: ""Ugh, nevermind! I don't want the car wash anymore!""

Me: ""But--""

Lady: ""Just let me pay for my gas so I can go!""

Me: ""... Alright then.""

A customer and I were babbling about stuff, and I told her to try those churros a few blocks down (rural, takes 2 minutes). I thought nothing of it. Just popped up since we were talking about candle scents and food. 

Something came up. Her credit card wouldn't read in the machine or we didn't take that card. Something along those lines, so I held her items back (somewhat of a risk since 90% of the time customers never come back for clothes. Maybe they lose their wallet, who knows).

A young mom with a toddler and another child in a stroller are waiting in the line, when an older lady with her husband walk in. I finish up with my customer, and then say “I can help the next guest in line!”

The young mom is trying to get her toddler to walk up with her. Cue old lady.

“Well! I’ve been to this store MANY times, and I have NEVER been made to wait in a line before! Where is your manager, young lady! You’re being incredibly rude to me and I want to speak to your manager!”

Keep in mind, there is only the mom she would have to wait for, and even her husband is telling her “Dear, let’s not make a big deal, the line is right there. It won’t take very long.” I’m apologizing to her, saying I didn’t mean to be rude, etc. This lady will not be pacified, and starts threatening to call corporate.

spider-friend,ARE YOU HAPPY? QUIT GANGSTALKING ME.,"So, there's a shoplifter that always comes in my store. The last time we tried to kick her out, the police took two hours to arrive and she spent the entire two hours flipping out and screaming at us. She's disgusting, has sores all over her body, meth mouth, hacked off blond hair,  the whole nine yards. She's stolen a ton of stuff from us, we have proof, a trespass order, and though we've tried to be extremely nice to her in the past, she just couldn't stop getting her fix. 

&amp;#x200B;

She came in today, and this was the first time I had been on the clock for her post-tantrum shenanigans. The other managers are....somewhat cowardly when it comes to suspicious persons. I, on the other hand, take delight in pissing them off. Now, I deal with a lot of meth heads. And I happen to know the best way to piss off a meth head is to make them paranoid.

&amp;#x200B;

So she comes in with her boytoy, looking especially meth-y since the last I saw her. I say ""Hey! Nice to see you again! I'll be right around here if you need any help. And I give her the trademark stare. You know the one. The one that every mid-level under-paid over-worked manager gives that chills you straight to the bone as though Satan himself just shook your hand. She nods and keeps looking through the overpriced apparel, you know, the ones that have the curvy checkmark on them. You know, the ones that everyone comes in and rips the sensors off of? But I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

I stand right behind her, five feet away. And I stare. 

&amp;#x200B;

She starts wigging out a little. Puts a bunch of thin, easy-to-fold-and-stuff-in-your-pants clothing in her arms, and walks over to a different department.

&amp;#x200B;

I follow behind the whole time, just staring. Not saying a word.

&amp;#x200B;

She starts whispering to her boytoy. ""Look at this bitch. We're being gangstalked right now. This is gangstalking. I'm being gangstalked."" Picks up another piece of clothing. High price, sensored.

&amp;#x200B;

I just follow. Don't say a word. Just stare.

&amp;#x200B;

She moves to every department in the store. Every single one. The whole time I just follow behind her. Staring.

&amp;#x200B;

I can tell she's at least a little sober this time, because she's speaking in coherent sentences. She's telling her boytoy that I'm a bitch, I'm a whore, etc., etc., etc...nothing I haven't heard before lady.

&amp;#x200B;

She walks by me and says ""This is harassing. You are harassing me. I could call the police on you. What you're doing is wrong."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I just smile and said ""It's my store, turns out I can stand wherever I want!"" And kept staring.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, she gets fed up. She SLAMS her armful of merchandise on our front counter, STOMPS over to her bike, tells her boytoy ""We are LEAVING. I am SO SICK of being TREATED LIKE THIS. LOOK AT HER.

We have a small repair kit at work with some pliers, it has a bunch of o rings and spare clasps for jewellery. One day a customer came into my store with his family and asked me if we sold o rings. He wanted to fix his bracelet he purchased from another store. I offered to fix it and he didn’t want me to do it, so I put a couple of o rings in a tiny resealable bag and gave it to him. He asked for the cost and I told him it’s free, our repair kit had over 100 of these cheap little o rings. I told him that if he lost the the ones I gave him, to come back in and I’d give him some more considering they are quite small.

He came back in later in the afternoon, and I thought that maybe he would need some more o rings. Instead, him and his family gave me a box of expensive chocolates expressing how thankful they were and how much they struggled finding the o rings until they came into my store. They praised my customer service and were the kindest souls. I was in absolute shock because I didn’t feel like it was deserved. This will always stick with me, they absolutely made my year with it.

illogicalSolutions,Sorry but FedEx already left... but hold on one second..,"I work at a company that’s rather large in the Honda/Acura Aftermarket community. We hold a few world records and sell a LOT of parts for both street use and drag racing (on a race track) use. Over the last three days I’ve been working closely with a customer trying to verify his order as my system detected the address he was trying to ship to did not match the actual BILLING address of the card he was using and therefore we could not ship out his order (moreso to protect the company from a fraudulent order).  

I started to inform him that with the information he just provided, I was finally able to verify his order and was that we would be able to get it shipped tomorrow, as FedEx has already left...in the midst of me saying this, I looked up, saw the FedEx truck barely pulling out of the parking lot, and just reacted by flying out of my seat, running out the door, and chasing down the truck with my headset on. Truck driver heard me yelling, stopped, and let me get the package shipped out.. I told the customer I was able to stop FedEx and he could hear me gasping for air as I just had become super winded and thanked me over and over and said that nobody had ever gone out of their way for him to just get their parts a day earlier. 

Customer called me today (day of posting, not day of the event) to express his gratitude towards me. Such a feel good moment!!",TalesFromRetail,1807,1563410107

L: Can I have two packs of Newport light 100s?

Me: I’m sorry but we don’t have any. We’ve been having problems with the distributor so all we have are the light shorts.

MylilJr,Customer lies and assumes we are a chain retail,"I work at a small-but-not-so-small local furniture store as a cashier. When I say furniture I mean we mostly profit off of plates and other kitchen merchandise. Naturally because of the sheer amount of plates, when a store wide sale comes around customers tend to leave non-discounted items in the wrong place.

So from time to time customers are frustrated when a plate they come to check out comes out regular price which is 100% understandable.

Once during our store sale, I had a customer with around 2 dozens of varying items, mostly plates. Unfortunately for her none of the items ring up as sales price as they are our “hot buys” aka new seasonal items. 

She proceeded to claim these were supposed to be among our sales items and so I told her the plates she had are new dinner plates. Now, so that things don’t get confusing, the percentage sale she was claiming these were under was xx% off, which is the BIGGEST percentages off we have. That sale was ONLY for the dessert plate collection.

Her reply was, “These are plates! What else would they be used for aside from dinner? What’s the difference?” She then scoffed and crossed her arms in annoyance.

There is a ginormous difference. Dessert plates in that particular collection was small and often came with cutlery and sets to entice customers to buy in bulk.

I asked her if she knew where she got these from. I knew she was just lying but I was asking out of courtesy to see if some items were misplaced.
Lo and behold, she would only point at a generalized direction and acted as if this whole thing was a waste of her time (of course, not wasteful enough to simply show herself to the door and forget this whole thing).

At this point she began claiming she bought the same exact items just a few days ago. Mind you, these were 2 dozens of items of different models and location so unless she painstakingly memorized each of them there was no way she could’ve recalled that. I told her these items are recent and have not gone on sale for the duration of their shelf time. 

I think this was when she gave up trying to haggle me because she just let out a frustrated sigh and said “It must’ve been another one of your stores then, because I got those items xx% off. I don’t need them anymore.” And walked away.

This store is not a chain. It’s literally the only one in existence.",TalesFromRetail,2026,1563135688

nvfh33,Credit or debit only.,"This is by far my favorite tale to tell from my many years working in retail, though I tell it better in person. This story takes place around 2011 when I was a department supervisor in a sporting goods retailer. My department consisted of all of the apparel and accessories on the second floor of the store and was situated, mostly, by the exit to the attached mall. It was common practice for floor supervisors to jump on a register and take debit/credit purchases when lines got long and that particular register station was up to me to watch out for. 

Business as usual, I notice that there is a line building at the register so I head over to help out the cashier. Since I am a floor employee, I do not have a cash till. To get one is always an ordeal and not necessary to kill a line (it would waste a half hour to count the drawer in and then the same to count it out). Generally customers are happy to not have to wait as long, even if they are paying cash there become closer to checkout. Not today. It is also important to note that at this register station there were 4 registers and each lane is divided by display shelves filled with impulse buy items like water bottles and other small fitness items.

So I am going about my usual, ""I can take next in line paying credit or debit only"" and taking care of customers quickly. Today, however, there was a father roughly in his 30s with his two kids (a boy and girl probably around 8 &amp; 10ish). He became next in line, or so, for the regular cashier but I suppose that this was not good enough. What probably made him more upset is that I was now taking customers behind him in line. 

To be honest, I was on auto pilot at this point until the tantrum started. Still standing in the line, he started to demand that I ring him out. I first ask if he is paying with a debit or credit card. He tells me no, he is paying with cash and I politely apologize and tell him that I do not have a cash drawer and therefor would not be able to make change for him. After some choice words, I offered to take him if he was able to pay in exact change but he refused that as well. More yelling ensued about it not being fair, despite his wait time being cut by half or more. He then throws the armful of items he was buying for his kids to the floor, turns to the display next to him and clears two shelves of water bottles with his arms and storms out into the mall...leaving his two children standing there shocked and embarrassed. 

By this point the line was under control enough that I went and tended to the mess on the floor. His poor children, not knowing what else to do, started to pick up the water bottles from the floor as I tended to the pile of their items. Other customers helped and I assured the kids that they were not responsible for the mess or to clean it up but thanked them for their help. It was a good 10 minutes before the father came back for his children. I had enough time to both clean up the mess and hunt down a manager to then hunt down the number for mall security. Neither of which is a quick task. He showed up just as I was phoning security to let them know of the abandoned children.

Of all the adult temper tantrums I have witnessed, this was by far the most memorable. 

TLDR; Grown man throws a tantrum after saving time, makes a giant mess and storms off without his kids.",TalesFromRetail,1464,1562961525
tno2s,"She said she’s not a hugger, but that it looked like I needed one.","For some idiotic reason, when we (cashiers) get our tills in the morning, there’s only 4 20’s in the till. We also don’t ever have $10s for some reason. They just never give us any. So at the start of the morning I have $80 and a lot of fives and ones. 

I work at a HUGE grocery store. People buy hundreds of dollars worth of stuff. People frequently want $100 cash back or will pay for a $7 purchase with a $100 bill. Yes, even at 8 am. So today, I had no more twenties left, 20 minutes into my shift. I had ONLY 5’s and 1’s. Then a lady wanted $100 cash back. Geez.

I told her. Ma’am, I have absolutely no change for you. I put in the code on my register for a manager. They usually take between 5-15 minutes to just look at their notifications, let alone act on them. So me and this lady are just standing in silence. She asks why I don’t have more twenties. I say, that’s a damn good question.

She doesn’t wanna hold up the line so she says, I’ll stand on the side and Ill wait for them to bring you the money. Sure, i ring up more people. My manager comes and berates me, for not having change i guess? Then talks to the woman like she’s stupid, and drops off my change. The woman tells me she’s sorry I have to deal with this, and that my manager shouldn’t have talked to either of us that way. I tell her thank you and she leaves. The whole ordeal lasted probably 25 minutes. Poor thing.

Then the next lady in line can probably see it on my face, or she heard/saw the whole thing. She asks if I’m having a good day. I shake my head. She said that I shouldn’t let people get me down, and I should not let anyone else ruin my day because my day is for me. I smiled and thanked her then she said she isn’t a hugger but wanted to give me one anyway, and she came around and hugged me. I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable so I patted her lightly, but she hugged me tight, a real hug. She meant it.

It really meant a lot to me. My depression has come back, really hard this time. It’s hard to get out of bed and commit to being there for 8 or 9 hours at a time, especially when dumb crap like that happens. It felt so nice that she wanted to give me a hug, cuz she saw me as a real person, not just a cashier who doesn’t matter.",TalesFromRetail,2225,1562893018
Defenestrationism,Quick Thinking Saves A Coworker's Feet,"I worked with this guy a few years ago at the retail store where I'm employed.  He was generally a nice fellow, a bit obnoxious and overbearing, but otherwise a decent and jolly person.  He was diabetic and struggled with the typical foot issues which often come with that condition, including really bad foot odor.  He sometimes had to change his socks and wash his feet halfway through his shift to avoid being offensive to those around him.  

He was doing his usual sock change one day and apparently got the bright idea to try some 'all natural', concentrated, citrus-oil-based room deodorizing spray directly on his feet to see if it would help to stifle the odor a bit more. Pretty sure his reasoning was that natural = safe to use. As many of us know, that is not often the case.

Having come in on the aftermath of this with him getting red in the face and panicky because his feet suddenly started burning and he was frantically and clumsily trying to wash them in the sink in my department (he's middle-aged and not very flexible, so it was difficult for him), which didn't seem to help much.  I asked him what happened and immediately remembered that spray was oil-based, not for topical use, highly acidic, and likely had started to sink into his skin, making it difficult to wash off.  At this point I remembered some basic high school chemistry about bases counteracting acids and breaking up oils fairly well, ran to the back of my department, grabbed some baking soda, a bucket, filled it a third of the way with water, dropped a handful of baking soda in it, mixed it up quick and told him to immediately put his feet in the bucket.  

His relief was nearly instantaneous. We waited until the burning subsided completely and a few minutes more just to be safe, gave his feet a rinse-off, and followed up with some lotion because the solution likely stripped away much of the oils in his skin as well as the citrus oil.  A few days later, he thanked me for what I did and told me that he'd gone to his podiatrist to get help with the chemical burns.  The podiatrist told me that, in light of his other health and foot issues, I had probably saved his feet.  

I don't think I've ever saved another person's body parts before so this was a unique experience.  The kicker is that I flunked out of high school chemistry but did at least remember enough to help someone out.",TalesFromRetail,2180,1562853942
OonerspismsFarUn,"""Blood member"" tells me not to disrespect him because he made a mistake and got mad.","I work in a small convenience store chain in the upper middle US. This is my second employment here. I was previously employed two years ago. This is kind of important to the story.

A guy comes in this evening and wants to purchase two Jazz Black &amp; Milds. He has exactly $21.56 on his debit card. The total is $2.09. He gives me two quarters, takes three pennies from the penny jar, and pays the remaining $1.56 on a card. The machine prompts him asking if he wants cash back, he enters $20, and confirms. The till rings up, pops open, but says the change due is $0. We're both confused, but the receipt says he got $20 back. He starts raising his voice, so I raise my hand calmly, asking him to calm down so I can try to figure it out. 

He gets louder, claiming I'm disrespecting him, and walks out to show me on his phone that he was right. He gets in his car and drives away without the cigars he paid for. 

He comes back about 15 minutes later, admits that he was wrong, because his card charges $1 for transactions and he didn't have enough to get that cash back.

Uncreativeusername10,Angry customers are shocked by workers having human emotions,"Hey y'all, this is a story from a few years back when I worked as a receptionist at a nail salon. I recently left my long term customer service job, and I guess as a coping mechanism I've been reliving old awful experiences in customer service so I don't feel as bad. So, here we go. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the time that I worked at the salon I was 17, and I looked like it. It was a Sunday, and as usual I arrived 10 min early so I could set up my desk and go over appointments for the day. However, as I was walking up I saw a small line waiting for the salon to open... oof. 

This was not good news because this place wasn't the best managed. When we would first open we only had like...2 nail techs in (who usually were only in that early for their appointments). And since I was the receptionist (AKA the punching bag) I already knew this was bad news for me. I gulped down my anxiety and walked in, and I started setting up. I only worked weekends at this time, which is important to note because when I saw a full appointment book with no spaces open that I knew I was NOT responsible for, I was mortified. 

A few moments later, the owners started allowing the line in. I greet them and start to handle them realizing that the majority of them are walk ins...not even appointments. Going back to the badly managed thing from earlier- the owners would have killed me if I were to send away any customers. It didn't matter if there was literally no room to service them and we had 2 nail techs on the job, I was supposed to humor them. Now I did try to give them a heads up when the owners weren't watching me, by like trying to tell them that it would be a very long wait and that we have a lot of appointments coming in, but they could either take the warning and leave or think I was exaggerating and stay. We had a full lobby of waiting customers and only had 2 more nail techs walk in almost an hour after opening. 

Working there was kind of a nightmare for me because the nail techs knew that 9/10 times I would have to be the one dealing with angry customers, so they would kind of take advantage of that by blaming their own mistakes on me so I would get yelled at instead. For example, on this day since we were so busy; one nail tech decided to stop in the middle of servicing one client to just start working on another...and just kinda left the original one there with no explanation. When the client got angry and confronted the nail tech, they told her that it was my fault for not letting them know about an appointment...which was a blatant lie. The nail tech pulled that move because they thought they could get away with it and make more money in less time. That customer ran up to me, got in my face, and started screaming full volume at me that I was terrible at my job and that it was all my fault her day was ruined and ""what was I even good for"".  There was a lot more, but this was a long time ago and that's all I can remember. After she finished yelling at me she went back over to her pedicure chair and glared at me for the rest of her stay, at one point she even put up her middle finger at me. 

Not even 10 min later I was being screamed at by another customer for helping a client that walked in before she did... because she genuinely thought her time was more important than the other customer who was there before her. She was pretty nasty to me as well, said I was a stupid child. The original customer that I was helping was understanding and apologized to me for the other woman's behavior, and chose to leave. The woman who started the mess got very smug about this, and as I was helping her into a pedicure chair to wait for the next available tech, she purposefully stuck her nasty old feet centimeters away from my face while I was trying to adjust the water for her. 

On that same day the WiFi went out, so the computer wasn't accepting card payments for like an hour until the WiFi came back up. Cue more angry screaming customers. Keep in mind, my bosses witnessed all of this. They just didn't care. They never stepped up for me, they never helped me, they didn't even acknowledge any of it. I had to handle their mess all on my own. At some point while I was being screamed at by yet another grown woman I just started crying because I couldn't take it anymore. It was the type of crying that you try to hold back, but you just can't so it comes out sounding really ugly with snot dripping out your nose and your whole face turning red and swelling up. 

The interesting thing about this though....was that all the customers that were previously being as nasty to me as they possibly could be were *shocked.* Like they couldn't believe their eyes. They stared at me with utter disbelief and looked like they had seen a ghost. When their time finished and I had to individually ring them up they suddenly treated me with the manners they should have started with. They couldn't look me in the eye, and were extremely soft spoken and ran out hurriedly after they signed their receipt. Every. Last. One of them.

MissAmTO,Go rip it out of their hands for me!,"I used to work for a retailer that sold ""collectible figurines"" that had special releases. On my very last day, there was a limited edition release where there was only one special variant in the entire store. I was also on my own that morning, the seasonal associate who was supposed to be there pulled a no-show.
Now the rules about buying and seeling these were specific: 

- No line-ups outside the store before opening 
-Any line-ups will not be treated as such, first person to grab item gets it
- Only one variant per person
-No holds
-Cannot answer calls about said item 
-And since it was a variant, said item could not be looked up in the computer. 

So on this day, there were a few people lined up outside the store before the gate opened, a family of regulars and two guys I don't know. 

I open the doors, and the family of regulars goes straight to the back of the store for the item, while the new guys stop and chat with me for a while. 

I go about my usual opening business, opening audit, whatever. 
I'm disrupted by the new guys ripping apart the entire wall of figurines. I asked them what they were looking for, and when they named the variant figurine, I mentioned that there was only one, and that someone else must have already grabbed it.

Junglalo,I will fight you for a sandwich you don't sell,"I'm on mobile, sorry for weird formatting.

Okay, so, a little backstory for this.  This story happened a year and a half ago back at my old job at a sandwich shop that was connected to a truck stop.  At this shop chain there were secret menu items.  Our specific store did not participate in secret menu items as we did not get the ingredients (or enough of those ingredients) to actually make those sandwiches.  One sandwich was called the feast.  My manager had told us that we are never, under any circumstance, to make that sandwich.  The reason being is that the feast used all of our cold lunch meats.  Basically, you would put the amount you'd put on a large sandwich, then double it.  We never got enough product on our trucks to even do that.  Our manager was so adamant about not selling it that she even had it taken out of our system along with most of the secret menu item sandwiches.  Now that you have the backstory, let's dive in.

M=Me
C=Coworker
T=Truck stop worker
R= Excessively rude customer

So, it was a quiet night at the truck stop.  I was doing my job and restocking the food on the line.  When a customer came in.

R: I would like to order the feast.

M: I'm sorry sir, but we don't carry that sandwich here.

R: What?!  I've gotten that sandwich here before!

M: I'm sorry, but our manager had told us-

At this point he cuts me off while I'm talking and immediately just starts screaming in my face.

R: I've gotten it here half a dozen times before!  Are you calling me a liar?!

I learned later that the half dozen times was a lie.  We had only sold the feat three times to three separate customers before our manager cut it off.  It was using too much product.

M: Excuse me, but I'm going to get my coworker.

I left the sandwich prep area and went into the back room and explained the situation to my coworker.  My coworker then went out to the customer while I stayed behind the door to listen in.

C: What seems to be the probl-

Before my coworker can even finish his question, the customer cuts him off and immediately starts screaming and spitting at him.

R: That little b**ch who was out here before told me that you don't have the feast sandwich!  I've gotten it here half a dozen time before!  She was denying me service!

C: Sir, I'm sorry, but we are not allowed to sell that sandwich.  

In that moment, I swear I felt the building turn ice cold with the only source of heat being the customer's unbridled and unwarranted rage.

R: So you're going to f**king deny me service too!  What the f**k?!  I saw a manager on the other side!  I'm going to call your corporate office and I'm going to get you fired!  Both of you!

I was peeking through the window and I saw the customer lean down to try and read my coworker's name tag.  My coworker proudly held out his name tag and spelled his name out for him in a 'I'm done with this bs' manner.

A few minutes after the man had stormed over to the truck stop side, the truck stop worker came over.

T: Hey, what's going on?  This man says you're denying him service.  I want to get your side.

C: He wants us to make the feast.  It's a secret menu item that we aren't supposed to sell.

T: Why don't you just make it and get it over with?

M: Because our manager said no.

T: She said no?

C: Our manager said we aren't supposed to mention it, we don't know what goes on it, we are not allowed to sell it.

T: Okay, well, if your manager said it I'll go ahead and tell him that even if you could sell it, you're out of several things that are supposed to go on it.

She leaves our side and my coworker and I thought we had seen the last of him.  Not even five minutes after she had left, my coworker and I hear the man yelling at the top of his lungs in front of the sandwich area.  He sounds livid.

My coworker instructs me to not go out to the front and to be ready to call the police in case this customer throws a punch.  I wait in the back, by the door out of sight.

R: So everyone in this store is against me now!  I just want a f**king sandwich!  Give me the feast!

C: I'm sorry, sir, but we-

R: You're STILL going to deny me service!?  Well!  How about we go outside and settle this with our fists like men!  Maybe THAT will change your attitude!

C: You know what, sir, I have a lot of work to do.  I'm not going to go outside and 'settle' this issue.  That's something a child would do, and unfortunately, I'm an adult who doesn't have time to babysit.  Have a good night!

My coworker comes back to the back and we watch the customer leave.  As he leaves, he kicks over a table and two chairs.  He slams the door as hard as he can causing the hinges to come loose.  We never see him leave the parking lot.

M: I'm not going out to my car alone.  Not if that guy is still out there.

C: I don't blame you.  I can walk you out to your car when you leave.

As I leave, the truck stop worker had my worker pull his truck into the front customer area so he can get to his truck quickly and avoid and altercation with the customer.

I wish there was a happy ending to this one, but there really isn't.  A customer got away with nearly breaking a table and two chairs and causing damage to the hinges on our door.

To this day, I still wonder how someone could be so upset about a sandwich.",TalesFromRetail,1453,1562600511
vulfreim,"Lady bothers me about an item’s price as I enter the bathroom and go into a stall, and actually hounds me inside of the bathroom as well.","I’m the kind of person where, if I gotta go, *I gotta go.*

I was heading off to the bathroom (we do not have a staff bathroom) to do my business. A customer must’ve seen me go in and she said “excuse me!” I responded saying that I’ll be with her in a second as I really had to use the toilet.

She followed me into the bathroom. After I sat down in a stall, she started to ask me questions about an item. It was really awkward to do my business with someone actively talking to me, let alone a stranger. I told her politely to please give me a minute because this is a violation of my privacy, and she’s being incredibly rude, and that I’ll be with her soon.

She stopped talking but remained in the bathroom. When I flushed and left the stall, she followed me while I went to the sink to wash my hands to ask her question again. 

I gave up. She was really making me mad and I completely gave up. After I was done properly serving her, I called her a rude, stuck-up princess who lacks respect for anyone.",TalesFromRetail,3002,1562530234
RunicNature,"Lady doesnt want to pay full price for fabric, so she tries to be smart.","I work in the fabrics and crafts department of a large retail chain.

Yesterday I had a customer come in and she dropped about five bolts of fabric on my table. Half yard for each bolt. Okay, sure, fine. Throughout my cutting, she kept adding more and more and more bolts- totalling to about 20 bolts maybe?

Either way, she had enough fabric totaling somewhere around $40. When she saw the price tag, she just sorta scrunched her nose and began taking cuts out of the bundle I'd made for her. She did it with such a finesse that I'm almost certain now that she's done this before.

New price tag, $10. She had me take off at least 9 cuts from her bundle, though I didn't really count.

Now, store policy states that any cuts that are less than a yard, they're to be remnanted and discounted. I only got around to doing this to one of the pieces before I got pulled to do something else.

Several hours later, I come back to my table and there she is, digging furiously through the basket of remnants- the one cut I was able to discount clutched in her grubby hands. She notices me standing there and whirls on me:

""Do you have anymore remnants??!!!""

Me: ""no, sorry, that's all of them there.""

Lady: ""are you sure? I thought I saw some others a little bit ago.""

Me: ""yeah, I'm sure, I cleared out my remnant box about an hour ago"" 

At this point I pulled an empty box from under my table. It wasn't the remnant box, but it did its trick. Her eyes widened in stark realization that she must have been too late for her cheap fabric! She shuffled off and that was that.

This morning she returned. All those cuts she left behind she got again, half a yard each. 

She didn't know that those cuts she made yesterday were still sitting under my table, waiting to be remnanted. And they wont be until tomorrow.

Oh, retail.",TalesFromRetail,2930,1562452411

Just a little absolutely adorable event that happened in my shop

&amp;#x200B;

""My son is a little gnocchi"", she tells me, grinning. She is a lovely, cream skinned, green eyed, young woman, with hair so gloriously coppery one may expect a crown of clovers to be weaving through her curls.

It the stroller, the cutest little boy is waving at me, babbling enthusiastic greetings and smacking big wet kisses in my direction.  
Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not the biggest fan of kids, esepcially in retail where the can spell troubles quicker that thought, but I have a weakness: the well behaved ones, and this little kiddo with his hazelnut hair and skin as golden as a freshly baked cookie, is definitely one of them.  
""I.. I don't get it, sorry""  
Eyes crinkled in laugh, chocolate brown for the kid, vivid green for the mother, so different yet the very same expression, they laugh.  
""I'm from Dublin. His dad is from Naples. He's a little half potato, half pasta. A gnocchi!""

sflo97,Customers are STUPID,"I’m a cashier at my local grocery store. I’m very understanding and accommodating when it comes to how customers want their stuff bagged as long as they are nice. 

Well recently, a customer came in, and she told me to bag light, and for me to double bag the heavier stuff. That’s perfectly fine by me. 

I start bagging. After about 3 bags, she goes over to start putting them in her cart. But I can tell she is a little frustrated and starts to double bag what I’ve already bagged. Then she says, “were you just not going to double bag these?”

So then I said, “oh, I thought you only wanted the heavier ones bagged?”

Then she said, “well these are heavy.” And is frustrated. She later told me she has a bad back and that’s why they have to be light. 

I was a little frustrated by this point though. But I nicely said, “oh, okay. I’m sorry. Everyone has a different version of what “heavy” means.”

It got to the point where I was basically putting one item per bag then double bagging it. It was just annoying. She wasn’t necessarily rude, but she also wasn’t that nice either. 

Finally she leaves. Then, about 30 minutes later, she comes back in the store to ask what time it is for some reason. But when she comes back in, she has all 20 OF HER BAGS IN HER TWO HANDS. 

Why on EARTH did she make such a fuss about the bags being too heavy, if you were going to walk around with all of your groceries at once. 

Customers can be so dumb sometimes!",TalesFromRetail,1791,1562347933
StainedFingers,Takes From the Pumps: Wherein I Witnessed Domestic Abuse,"I must apologize in advance, because this story does not have a happy ending, to my knowledge. I must also apologize because my mind is not what anyone would call a steel trap, and this occurred over a year ago, so many of the details might be slightly off.

For anyone who has read any of my previous posts, you know that I work as a gas attendant in an area that doesn't allow you to pump your own gas. This often gives me a front-row seat to much of the craziness that occurs in a gas station/convenience store parking lot.

A woman pulled into one of my lanes and I went to approach her. It was clear she was upset about something; her hands were shaking and her voice had a slight quaver to it. She asked for a very small amount of gas and pleaded for me to make it as fast as possible. Normally, a request like this would annoy me, as if the customers thought I had significant control over the speed of the pumps, but in this instance it didn't bother me at all.

The gas was pumped post-haste and the customer went to pull away when a big pickup raced into the lot from the closer of the two entrances. My customer got halfway out of the parking lot before the truck cut her off by driving straight in front of her.

She swerved and managed to leave the lot, but the pickup followed and drove her off the road across the street. The driver, a muscled guy appropriately dressed in a wife-beater, jumped out of his truck, pulled open my customer's door, and pulled her out of her car.

At this point, both myself and the only other customer in the lot (it was well past midnight in the off-season for our town, so fairly dead) phoned 911. While waiting for the police to show up, we watched as the guy ripped a cell phone from the woman's hands and smashing it on the ground before starting to scream at her. The police, thankfully, arrived pretty damn quickly and cuffed the guy. Sadly, she must have chosen not to press charges, because they released him minutes later, and they left separately.

I get that there are two sides to this story and the woman could have done something horrible to him, but he could have easily hurt her or worse if she hadn't managed to avoid his truck.",TalesFromRetail,752,1562275438
alldayinfocus,I won’t reset anyone’s phone anymore...,"I work in a phone repair shop in South Florida. We see the worst. 

One thing we often have is people with the need to reset,restore their phone. I typically deny this service primarily for the reason I’m about to yell you, but I’d like you to understand how it’s comical in a way. People that come through this door for whatever reason have a lower iq than the rest. So when I tell people that a reset on their phone means that it deletes everything they can’t grasp or understand what that means. I go far into detail like this verbatim.

Me: the restore erases everything on your phone. Pictures, messages, mail, contacts, apps and everything will be gone. It will be as if you never owned this phone. A brand new phone as far as software is concerned. Everything of yours will be gone. 

That message  has grown over the last five years because people just don’t get it. So for a long while I had stopped offering to restore people’s phones. I just got into the rhythm of saying our computer doesn’t have iTunes and we aren’t authorized. It was a win for me tbh. I don’t like this job as far as the customers go and the repairs. Perhaps a bad POV but it’s made me grow cold and numb. So saying no to someone isn’t difficult especially if I know the other outcome can possibly be an issue. So keep this in mind going forward 

One day this mid age lady comes in and att sent her because of a issue and needed the phone reset. I had already started saying no but my boss was like nah man let’s just do it for her because att sent her and whatever. I ask him if he’s sure because she was already being a little rude when she came in and I got a not so bright vibe from her. So he tells me to do it and I’m like you’re the boss....I gave her the entire spill front and back. I reset the phone and immediately is lost on why everything is gone. I remember looking at my boss with a stare that said “you see why bro?” She’s than trying to login into her emails and this is when she is screaming that her email is signed out. She’s going on like this
OMG WHY THE FUCK DID ATT SEND ME HERE? YOU DELETED MY EMAILS!!! 

I start saying mam I told you this would happen when it’s reset. She goes on saying I never said anything. I said ummm yes mam I did. She’s like no you didn’t...I go ok cool we have security cameras so I pulled out my phone and went into our app and went right to where we had the convo and she than starts reverting and saying that it was unprofessional that I used the video as proof. That I should of just went by what she said because customers are always right......so now the entire company doesn’t do restores",TalesFromRetail,3249,1562193629
BobbyPotter,Customer gets mad that I'm saving her money,"I literally just remembered this story from a few months ago...

I work in a pharmacy but it's in a shop so we'd also have to help cover the tills. We have a permanent ""buy two get third free"" offer on vitamins and supplements. A woman comes to the till with three lots of vitamins at £5.99 per item, so the total is £11.98 but obviously she didn't hear me tell her the total because she then handed me a voucher to ""save £2 when you spend £15 or more on vitamins"". I told her that because of the ""b2g1f"" offer she's already saved £5.99 and her total is less than £15 so she didn't need to use the voucher :) :)

Oh she was not happy. 

Her: But I picked up over £15 worth so that I could use the voucher!

Me: Yes but because of the offer your total comes to less than £15, so the till won't let me put it through

Her: This is ridiculous, that's the only reason I picked up three lots, so I could use the voucher 

Me: ???? But the total comes to less than what it would if you had used the voucher anyway? 

Her: Yes I know that but I wouldn't have picked up three if I knew I couldn't use the voucher!

There was more back and forth between us and at this point I can see my colleagues in the pharmacy laughing at the whole interaction which meant me trying my hardest to keep a straight face, I just wanted this transaction over and done with cos her logic was honestly mind boggling and I knew I had other things to be doing (not the attitude when working in retail I know, but we were just going round in circles).

Eventually she paid the lower price and left but not without making sure i had definitely handed back her precious voucher and muttering something about how ""ridiculous"" the rules are. 

I still to this day don't understand her logic.",TalesFromRetail,1033,1562180669
ComputerGeek1100,Getting Yelled At Because of the Customer I Just Helped,"Background: I'm a cashier/assistant supervisor at a warehouse store that requires a membership. This week, since it's right before the 4th of July, is extremely busy and even though I wasn't scheduled to be at a register today, I had to ring for a while to help with crowd control.

**The Cast:**

&gt;Me: Me

&gt;Unprepared Customer: UC

&gt;Angry Guy: AG

UC comes up to my line with two air mattresses and some other large items. She has a question about the price of the mattress but it doesn't take too long to resolve. She's not argumentative at all when I tell her that it's more expensive than she originally thought (which is unusual), but I'm not complaining. Then It's time to pay.

&gt;Me: Okay, your total is $265.__!

&gt;UC: Hold on a second.

As nice as she was, she hadn't even started looking through her purse for her payment method. After a few seconds, she pulls out two pre-paid MasterCard gift cards, which of course have to be run through the PIN Pad one at a time. This takes about 10-15 seconds per card.

Together, these total $150, and she has to dig through her purse to find the other $120 cash.

I give her the change and tell her to have a nice day. Overall, not an awful customer, but she could have been more prepared. Then there's AG, who's right behind her.

&gt;Me: Hi! How are you today?

&gt;AG: NOT GOOD. I'VE BEEN WAITING TOO F\*\*KING LONG IN THIS F\*\*CKING LINE. IT'S RIDICULOUS. BE PREPARED NEXT TIME.

I should mention that processing the woman's two gift cards and then the cash payment took an extra minute at most over a normal transaction. I've seen much worse, including a woman who once took five minutes to look through her purse and then tried to pay with another store's charge card.

Honestly, I'm not even sure what to say, because anything I could have said would probably upset him more. Thankfully, he only has two items.

After jamming his card into the card reader and angrily punching in his PIN, his transaction goes through. I hand him his receipt.

&gt;AG: SEE, HOW LONG DID THAT TAKE?!?

&gt;Me: Have a nice day.

AG stares angrily at me and walks away. 

All in all, I didn't actually let it bother me, but I always find it funny when people use retail employees as a punching bag for their issues with other customers. I couldn't have denied her payments; this would have irritated/embarrassed her as well as caused even more of a wait for the people behind her while I waited for a void from a manager.",TalesFromRetail,1079,1562112724
adriyens,Tried cleaning up after myself. Customers weren't having it.,"I work in a retail store that, due to budget cuts, only has two or three cashiers stationed at a time. We try our best to be as efficient as possible, but the line always gets disgustingly long, especially in the afternoon and evening.

Today my shift ended at 4, but since I had to wait for someone to take my place, I didn't log out of the POS system until around 4:30. Now, attempting to be courteous to my coworkers, I started to clean up since it was a giant mess behind the counter (putting hangers away, sorting returned items into the appropriate bins, etc).

I heard someone screech ""NEXT!"" from the line, which was their delightful way of telling me I should be ringing them up. I acknowledged them but didn't do anything about it because there're other cashiers at the registers. However, they kept berating me.

&gt;*Paraphrased for length's sake. It was a lot of back and forth of us repeating ourselves, but the sentiment remains.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**Customer:** Are you gonna be ringing us up anytime soon?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Sorry, I just got off. I'm cleaning up right now.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Customer:** \*huff\* Well, you should be ringing us up instead of cleaning up. If you're off, why are you doing that?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** I wanna put everything away before I go.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Customer:** Well if you're on the clock, you should be ringing us up.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** You know what? You're right. :)

So I clocked out and left.

I didn't need to clean up after myself (usually they have some non-cashier store associate come in and do it), so there was no need for me to still be there.

-ColdStew-,A customer was too lazy to hand me a broken product and caused an extreme fire hazard.,"This happened to me a few months ago at the supermarket I work at. As most do, my store sells more than just food. We have all the items you could need to host a party or do some basic home repairs. It was these items that caused the issue at my register.

For those who aren’t familiar with working retail, when a customer doesn’t need an item anymore they can happily return it to the cashier and have it “go-backed” or restocked. However, some customers do feel guilty or are afraid to present the item so they just lay it somewhere. Usually this could be chalked up to annoying and it takes an extra 30 seconds to pick up after them. However it was in my situation that this shyness could have caused my entire register to light fire.

I clocked into work and I started ringing up customers, after about 5 minutes I start to smell something funny. I keep smelling and after about 10 minutes I realize it smells like a gas station so I look around and figure it would pass as most smells in the store do. After 20 minutes of checking people out I start to get a headache so I closed my register and started to search for where the gas smell was coming from. After looking around the base of the register and under the shelves on my side I look at the candy racks. We have small baskets suspended over the ends of the belts with 5 hour energy and granola bars for sale, each one has 2 layers. There I see, behind a box of energy shots, A LEAKING BOTTLE OF LIGHTER FLUID. Someone noticed that their bottle was leaking and HID IT ABOVE WHERE FOOD GOES.

I instantly put it in a bag and clean my belt, and shut my register off. We have old technology and quite frankly I wouldn’t be supposed to find exposed wiring under the belts of our register. I’ve always known people are lazy and don’t like to turn in go backs but this was something else.",TalesFromRetail,1325,1561758210

There was no customers behind them, and he asked so politely, that I was like fuck it, and invited him behind the counter. 

I told him to step up on the ledge where we put go-backs, so he could see better. I showed him how to scan the toy, and after his dad paid for the toy, he left a happy kid.

I then politely asked if she had Google maps on her phone (I am aware some people don't have smartphones or don't know how to use apps, so I wanted to make sure).

misskarne,When the parents are chill,"Hi! So I used to run kids' activities at a big-box hardware chain store in Australia (welp, every Aussie now knows exactly what store).

One of these activities was facepainting on weekends. The facepainting was free, and though I wasn't much of an artist, I did develop some decent skills with a brush. Once I got a decent manager I also got to get my hands on the really good facepaint in about a million different colours, which helped.

What I found out really early on was that some parents are *really* uptight. A little girl might say, ""I want to be Spiderman!"" and their parent would say, ""Oh no, sweetie, that's a *boy* thing, don't you want to be a princess?"" My rule was ""the kid gets what the kid wants"" but often the parent would talk the kid out of it. With some exceptions...

Anyway, these two were the most precious:

\- This one little boy - maybe seven or eight - one day sat on my chair and asked, extremely politely, to be a rainbow butterfly. His dad was standing right behind him, with this grin on his face, and when I looked up, he just shrugged and said, ""He saw the one you did on another kid last weekend and decided that was what he wanted."" So  I painted his face into a rainbow butterfly and he was so, so happy, and his dad took pics on his phone ""so we can show mum how cool you look"". After that, this boy and his parents returned every weekend. I painted him every multiple coloured butterfly you can think of, I painted him as a fairy, I painted him as a princess (and a prince one weekend because he decided he wanted to try that). The kid was so, *so* polite and his parents never batted an eyelid. It was the best example of cool parenting you could get. (He would get disappointed when some weekends I did glitter tattoos instead of facepainting, and then he realised I had pretty much every colour glitter under the sun too.)

\- This was another little boy, maybe six or seven. He was an absolute hoot, though, wanted to be painted all kinds of unusual things. The one I vividly remember was the time he asked to be a BBQ. I sort of looked at him and went ""A BBQ? Like you have in the backyard?"" and he was like ""Yes!"". His parents were shrugging helplessly at me and his mum tried to say ""that might be a bit difficult for the nice lady to paint"" but I was like, ""Well, let me try."" I painted a sort of cross-hatch grill on each cheek in black and then did two sausages on one cheek and something resembling a steak on the other cheek. The kid was *over the moon*. Happy as larry. He and his parents thanked me so profusely. I think the next week he wanted tools painted on his face. I mean, ya gotta do it, right? (I'm pretty sure he was also the kid who told me an incredibly vivid story about the Hulk-Spiderman because that Spiderman was *green* so could I make him green Spiderman, please? Honestly, to this day I don't know if Green Spiderman is a thing, but the story was cool.)",TalesFromRetail,2011,1561463797
MsLerv,Lady was upset that I didn't take her order when she wasn't standing in line and then claimed I stole a dollar from her,"I guess I should say that I'm on mobile and that English is my native language. This is going to be a long one.

TLDR; The title

I work at an ice cream shop where people tell me what ice cream they want and what toppings to put in. If someone would to order, they have to stand by the ice cream to start. Sometimes people start by our register, so we also ask if people need help over there if they look like they haven't been helped.

Unfortunately, the star of our story didn't do either of these. 

This happened yesterday. The store was extremely busy with us having a line that never ended. When things get like this, it's hard to keep track of who came first so we rely on the customers to help us by staying by the ice cream when they haven't had their order taken and to move down when they have been helped. Since the store is a little bit understaffed, I was working with two trainees who didn't have much experience with working with a long line so I was a little stressed having to help them with their questions while also working with the customers I had.

So the line was dying down a little bit with about three groups in line. I had just finished up with a group on the register and looked at the line to see who needed help. My two other coworkers were both getting ice cream and I saw two groups standing away from the ice cream. So I assumed both were being helped. 

When I went to the third group, I greeted them and asked what they would like. That when I noticed the second group, namely the woman, staring daggers at me. Knowing this look because our system isn't 100% foolproof, I figured that she hadn't been helped yet. I whispered to my coworkers that she needed to be helped. I took an order and my other coworker who had finished up with her group took the other order. 

So I make the ice cream and run to the back to grab some items we were out of. When I come back out the woman is at the register and I see my other coworker is helping her. I jump on the register to ring her up because I knew she would be upset. Before I could even say hello to her she said ""YOU skipped us. We (gesturing to her young daughter) have been waiting""

Having dealt with customers like this before, I say as sincere as possible ""I'm so sorry about that. We usually serve people at our ice cream case, rather than where you were standing"" I realize it might have sounded a little rude, but at this point I wasn't in my Customer Service(tm) mode due to all the other customers that had worn me down. 

I tell her her total and she snarks back at me saying she wanted a water bottle. I add a water to her order and tell her her new total, $7.65. She handed me six dollars, that I had counted multiple times because her total was over seven dollars and I thought that I just couldn't count. Then I said ""Oh! You handed me six dollars. I'll just need a dollar and sixty-five cents."" 

I see that she is reaching for more money from her wallet so I just wait patiently while she says ""I know!!!! I'm getting it!!!"" 

Her daughter hands her two dollars and she snatches it out of her hand and whips them towards me. I pick them up off the counter and recount the money quietly under my breath. So now I have eight dollars. 

When I finished counting the money, she yells ""I WANT a dollar in QUARTERS back!"" I was a little confused because she had only handed me $8.

I replied to her ""Out of eight dollars"" As in she was paying with eight and I pressed the button on the register so it would open and I could give her her change. 

When I handed her back 35 cents, she started arguing with me that she wanted a dollar back in quarters. When I told her that she only have me $8, she then said ""no, I gave you six and then handed you t--"" and cut herself off when she realized her mistake. Rather than apologize for her mistake, she again threw a dollar at me, it fell between the wires for the screen to the register and she started huffing at me like it was my fault that I couldn't catch a dollar that I didn't even know was coming my way. 

I took the dollar and made change for her. Before she left the register, she turned to her daughter and said ""I should have counted it in front of her face!"" In a nasty voice that made me so angry that I almost commented back. She walked out and I rung up the original group that I was helping. They were a more quieter at this point because of what happened. They paid and left immediately. I felt bad for them because they had to watch it.

When I went to the backroom to find my two coworkers hiding because they had never dealt with an angry customer before today (we had two previous to this one) and they were a little bit nervous.

At the end of the night when I counted down the drawer, we were only missing a penny. Which I find as a win because of how busy we were and that four of us total were using the same register all day.

If I'm being honest, I never saw her come in and I don't know why she got the impression that she would be helped when it looked like she already was being helped.",TalesFromRetail,649,1561410754
NottRegular,HOW DARE YOU SCAN ME?,"First of all, please excuse the formating because I'm on mobile. 
 
I was at the register with a regular customer and I was chatting with him about his day while scanning his products. After him there was this lady who was speaking angrily at the phone in another language. And she was really pissed off. 
 
Me:me 
AL:angry lady 
 
Me: Hello, do you want a bag? 
AL passes in front of the client card scanner: HOW DARE YOU SCAN ME!! I DON'T HAVE YOUR CARD, DON'T SCAN ME! LOOK AT HOW THE RED LOOKS ON MY WHITE SHIRT. 
 
At this point I'm so shocked that my words left me. I rang her products and the total was around 32€. She gave me 50€. I barely had time to take the money and to put them in the register before she spoke again. 
 
AL: WHERE IS MY CHANGE, I WANT MY CHANGE. YOU ARE TRYING TO STEAL FROM ME. 
  
I stay silent and give her the change. While she was leaving she yelled again. 

AL: Y'ALL A BUNCH OF THIEVES. I'M NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN. 
 
I turned towards her with a ""WTF are you on lady"" expression and then turned back towards the next client. He had the same dumbstruck expression and just shrugged.",TalesFromRetail,2026,1561366551
crowsinks,You're going to let a DOG in a PET FRIENDLY STORE???,"I have so many stories from my summer job working at a cashier at a hardware store. This one just happened today and it really pissed me off.
I'm on mobile, so sorry for any typos or formatting issues. 

The store I work at is pet friendly, so a lot of customers like to bring their dogs in since not a lot of places allow you to do that. A lot of the customers say it's their dog's favorite place to go and a lot of the cashiers and some other employees carry dog treats to give out (with permission, of course.)

I usually like to make light conversation with dog owners so I can get in some good pets and give their pup a treat or two. This time I was on the self check out, and a couple had some kind of great dane mix, I think. She was really big and had a gorgeous fur pattern. I gave her a treat and she was super good about it, calm and polite. She barely paid anyone else any attention at all. 

When I walked away, a different lady came up to me with a sour look on her face and asked me ""how can you allow those big dogs in here?"" Within clear earshot of the couple with the dog. I was stunned at first. There aren't a lot of people who don't like dogs in this store, and I was pretty sure if it was a small dog, she wouldn't have said anything. I just told her we were a pet friendly store and any dog was welcome, and she walked away shaking her head. 
The people with the dog were obviously a bit concerned, so I just told her what she had said and assure them that their pupper was welcome back any time. 

I can see her being upset if the dog was behaving rudely, like barking or jumping up, but she was just calmly waiting for her owners to be done checking out. I have never met someone so mad that there was a dog in a pet friendly store. We don't discriminate agaisnt dog breeds and nobody else should either. In my experience, the bigger dogs are better behaved, anyways.",TalesFromRetail,709,1561315742
megles7187,Why won't you let me commit a fraudulent return!,"So he may not have asked it outright but you'll see! Idiot basically asking us how is he suppose to commit a fraudulent return. 

&amp;#x200B;

So this guy comes in wanting to return a nailgun that costs 300 dollars, he had the receipt, the nailgun serial number matched the box and it seemed new. So no real red flags. I asked if he was getting another one today, he said no. That the guys at work bought it for him and it wasn't what he needed. (So right there he immediately admitted it wasn't something he purchased with his card, ) Casually I asked if it was a gift, if he was getting a better one. He said no, not right now. At this point I already know to just put it back on the card. 

&amp;#x200B;

*It's pretty common at our store for people who do this to always say they didn't buy it, as a way to preemptively explain why someone else does in the cameras.* 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, I get to just casually talking to him while I finish the return. Putting it right on back to the card. This is when he gets upset. Also, keep in mind when I asked if he was getting a new one, he said no because his story changes to managers. G=Guy, M=Me, HC=Head Cashier, S=Supervisor

&amp;#x200B;

M: Alright, just need you to sign this and 315.00 is returned back to the card.

G: Will do-signs it-

M: Have a nice day.

G:-Still waiting-

M: Something else I can help you with?

G: Uh, yeh the cash.

M: It was put back on the card, 

G: But it was debit, don't I get cash back?

M: Not automatically, 

G: But how did you put it back on the card without me having the card?

M: We don't need to have the card anymore, 

G: Well, I need the cash, I told you I was getting another one

M: (not going to correct him, bad service to do so and pointless as he'd deny anyways) Oh I guess I got caught up in our conversation and forgot. Sorry

G: Okay, but I still need the cash. 

M: Once it's been returned to the card we can't stop it, It's already out of our system.

G: Well, can you get a manager to do it?

M: I'll call one.-Try calling but only ones are busy head cashier comes over. I explain-

HC: Yeah um, we can't cash it out once it's returned to the card. 

G: I TOLD her I was buying a new one right away, 

HC: Well, she should have done it as cash then. But there isn't anything we can do about it. I don't know why she wouldn't have done it for cash. We can price match the better one for you to this one. 

G: No I don't need a price match. ugh, let me just call the guy and see what we can do.

HC: -To me while we are private- Why didn't you cash it out?

M: I asked if he was getting another one, said no. I saw no reason to give him cash if it's not his card. He also didn't actually ask for cash which is weird for return fraud but he didn't. 

HC: Well, next time just cash it out. 

He returns to the desk.

G: Okay, so can my buddy do a phone sale, and then we cash out the return?

HC: Can you repeat that, I didn't quite hear.

G: Can he buy the nailgun, then I can return it for cash? 

HC: So you want him to buy the nailgun over the phone, so you can get cash from the return.

G: Yeah, you guys do phone sales.

HC: We do, but not for debit cards, just credit cards. And not for tools.

G: Okay well can you give me cash for a credit card purchase? 

HC: No...

G: Okay, so I'll need to speak with your manager because I don't understand why I am being punished for her mistake.

HC: Alright, one is on the way. 

M:-Private to Headcashier- See he just wants the cash. 

HC: Yeah.. yeh.. I see now

Supervisor walks over. Asks the guy what he can do for him.

G: -Guy explains, saying it's the cashier's mistake blah blah blah but then his brilliant plan- So now we just need to do a phone order, to buy a new nailgun then return it for cash.

S: Okay, so you need the phone sale to buy a new nailgun then why not just buy the new nailgun, from us or somewhere else?

G: Because, I need the nailgun now

S: Well, either way, we can't process a debit card over the phone. Your buddy will have to come in with the card and his id and purchase it.

G: Really!?! I don't see why I'm being punished here, she made the mistake! 

\-More arguing I missed because it was my lunch break. Later my supervisor approached me-

S: So glad you didn't cash that. I reminded your head-cashier that for debit card returns over a 200 dollars that they must have the card with them. That guy was a F--ing idiot.

labbykun,Girl threatens to call police for refusing cigarette sale,"Mobile, formatting, etc.

So this happened a few years back, when I was still a fledgling front end cashier. I was working front register on a closing shift and this couple comes in.
They both looked to be in their late teens/early twenties. They approach the counter and look at the cigarettes behind me. The boy proceeds to point out which cigarettes he'd like, to which I reply (according to policy at the time) ""I'll just need to see both IDs please.""
G=girl
B=boy
M=me

B: oh, I'm not with her. (Walks out)

M: (a bit flabbergasted) um...well, I still need to see his ID, since he picked them out.

G: but I'm the one paying for them.

M: sorry, ma'am. Company policy says I need to see ID for all parties appearing under the age of 27 (blah blah blah).

G: well he said he's not with me. So just sell me the cigarettes that I want to buy.

M: (shrugging helplessly) I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to.

Girl continues to belligerently argue over something so obvious, then leaves when she doesn't get her way.

I proceed to tell my manager and we have a good laugh.

But WAIT. There's MORE!

The girl returns while I'm on another register (away from cigs but still very close by) and my manager (MGR) is just getting ready to pull the drawer for the night. 

MGR: what can I do for you?

G: I'd LIKE to buy some cigarettes, since your CASHIER wouldn't sell them to me.

(Note: managers at this company are strictly trained NOT to go against cashier decision on not selling age restricted items to anyone)

MGR: well, I'm sorry ma'am, but if that's what he told you then that's the final decision. I'm sorry.

G: (getting angrier) sell me these cigarettes, or I am calling the POLICE!

At this point my manager's easy-going, cowboy-like ""aw shucks"" persona slips just a little. He placed his hands on the counter, looks the girl in the eyes and says ""do it then.""

She left after that. I tell him that's the same girl and we share even more laughs.",TalesFromRetail,2130,1561236571
twiggy572,I Insulted the Intelligence of her Two Year Old,"Small/local toy store employee. Fun fact before I start (for people who haven’t bought any kid toys recently) that toys will have some sort of labels on them. The labels can include where it was made, age recommendations, choking hazards, etc. From what I’ve observed, 95% of toys meant for ages 3+ are labeled as Choking Hazards. Not just a safety thing, but a liability for the companies. Relevant to this story. 

So I have a lady come in and walk up to me at the counter. 

Lady: “I need a toy for my 2 year old child. But before you say anything, he’s super smart. I mean like he’s so smart. He probably is too smart for all of your toys!”

I walk her to our building/manipulative toys to show her some recommendations. I was showing her stuff for her child’s age group (not labeled as a Choking Hazard). I showed her one after another and she just scoffed at all of them. I showed her one of our more popular toys for 2 year olds and she exclaims

Lady: “That is an insult to my child’s intelligence!”

I explain briefly how any older toys will most likely be choking hazards as I try with a few more. Finally, I give in and show her a toy for a 3 year old. Mind you, I had been trying to help her for a while now and went through dozens of toys with her. 

Lady: “That toy is a choking hazard! I can’t give that to my child!”

Me: “Well if you’re child is as smart as you say he is then he should know not to put tiny objects in his mouth!”

I had no control of that coming out of my mouth. I just spoke what was going through my mind and I immediately walked away before the customer could mutter anything. Boss had a good laugh at that one.",TalesFromRetail,1473,1561152019
SufficientlyAwkward,Customer finds regular price item on clearance rack. Pandemonium ensues.,"Hello again from the women’s clothing store. This happened a few days ago at my store, and it’s been stuck on my mind, so I decided to share. *Obligatory posting from mobile line here.*

So in my store, we keep our clearance items on their own racks, as they have a separate promotion that is different from our regular price items. Right now we’re running BOGO Free on all clearance, while regular price is only BOGO 50%.

Our clearance section also happens to be close to the fitting rooms, so it’s not uncommon to find a regular price item occasionally left on the clearance rack from someone who didn’t want to put their item back or leave it with our fitting room associate. 

I was at the register sending an email when a young woman (YW) and her mother from hell (MFH) came up to the register to check out with my associate (A).


A: Hi ladies, I hope you found everything alright!

YW: Definitely! It’s our first time in, and I loved everything I tried on.

MFH: Ring us up please.

A: Okay. Since it’s your first time in, I’d like to get you signed up for our loyalty program so you can get our coupons...

MFH: We’re NOT INTERESTED. I asked you to ring us up. Now, please.

YW: Mom, chill. (to A) Maybe I’ll sign up next time. We’re meeting someone for lunch soon and have to get going. 

A: Of course, I understand. (starts scanning) It looks like you need one more clearance item for the BOGO free deal, since you have three clearance and one regular price item. Would you like to go grab one more item while I bag this up?

MFH: No, everything there is clearance. We got it all from the clearance rack.

A: Let me double check these really quick. 


At this point, I stop typing my email and step over to her register, because I know mom is going to blow up when we tell her the jeans in her hand are not clearance. 


A: (to me) These jeans here aren’t ringing up clearance and they don’t have a clearance sticker on them.

Me: That’s because they’re regular price, right up there (points to rack at the front of the store). 

Me: (to MFH and YW) Sorry ladies, someone must have put those jeans back there by mistake. They are included with the BOGO 50% if you’d like to pick out another regular price item to go with them.

MFH: NO, I want you to honor the clearance price on those jeans!

Me: Ma’am, I’m sorry for the confusion, but there’s no clearance sticker on these jeans. They’re marked $70, which is the regular price.

MFH: Well just give us the clearance price marked on the other item I picked out!

YW: Mom, I can just pick out something else.

MFH: NO. THIS IS THEIR FAULT AND THEY WILL FIX IT. I WANT THE CLEARANCE DEAL.

Me: Even if I give you the BOGO Free, you’re still paying the full $70 on these jeans. The free item would be the cheaper of the two, and I’m not able to just give you a brand new pair of jeans for free because another customer left them on the wrong rack. 

MFH: THIS IS A BAIT AND SWITCH.

Me: No, it’s not. The rest of these pants are right here (walks to rack full of this particular jean and points). 

YW: I’ll just pick out another clearance item. Give me a minute.


MFH glares at me and A the entire time the daughter is gone. 


YW: Here, I found this shirt. 

A: Great choice. Did you still want the regular price jeans, or are we waiting on those?

YW: Yes, I want them. 

MFH: NO YOU DON’T. WE’RE NOT PAYING FOR THOSE. 

YW: It’s my money, it’s my jeans. Please ring them up.

MFH: I can’t believe you’re letting them treat us like this! (stomps towards the door)

YW: *under her breath* I can’t believe you’re acting like this.


My associate finishes the transaction and the young woman leaves behind her mom after apologizing for her behavior to both of us. We tell her it’s no biggie, and to come see us again. To which she says, “Oh I’ll be back! But I’ll leave her at home next time.”



TL;DR: Regular price jeans were on clearance rack. Mother demands clearance price, I say no. Daughter still buys jeans and is super nice while mom rages away into the sunset.",TalesFromRetail,1878,1561129445
NyteMyre,"""Actually, you owe us money""","Little story my nephew encountered while working at the counter this week.

Last monday, the store he works in had a promotional beer item for sale. A sort of [mini-cooler box for a six-pack of beer](https://media.hopt.eu/img/p/32211-46595-v4_product_img.jpg). Now on that monday, there was a mistake with the pricing. First of all, on the display, it was written they were €6,75, but they were actually €5,99. Furthermore, the register incorrectly added an additional €1,20 discount on it. So in total, the box (+ a six pack of beer in it) costed €4,79 for the first day. The six pack alone normally costs around €5,15. The next day, they fixed the incorrect discount.

On the 3rd day, my nephew got an ""angry"" customer at the information desk he was stationing. 

**Customer**: Monday I bought this cooler box, and yesterday I bought another one as a gift, but this time I didn't get the discount. 

\**Shows receipts showing the difference in prices**

**Him**: That's correct sir, the discount was an error that was fixed yesterday.

**Customer**:  That doesn't matter, it should have been the same price! I want my discount!

**Him**:  That's not possible.

**Customer**: Yes it is... it's only €1,20, just give it to me! Don't be difficult about it. You owe it to me.

**Him**: Actually sir, you owe us money because the discount was incorrectly given.... would like to pay in cash or card?

I work at a large chain craft store, and have  recently been transferred to their framing department. However, I have worked as a cashier/sales associate for the last year. 

As most stores that offer coupons work, there are always exclusions for what said coupons can be used on. One of these items was a $30 cart that rolls around and can have art supplies and such put on it. 

I have had to fight off many customers who were so personally offended that they could not use a coupon on this item because in reality it is very cheap for this item. Most other places/sites will sell these for upwards of $40-50. But its always been the same; it's an ""everyday low value"" so no you cannot get 40% off of it. 

Until people complained enough that the whole ""edv"" system was completely taken down.

aKamikazePilot,"""If you knock down the price by 20% off, I'll FOR SURE buy this hose!""","Another day, another story about a customer and wanting an item for a different price. For those that didn't see my ""$115 pump"" tale, some background info! I work as a sales associate at my ""farm and other departments"" retail store, where I work the hardware and farm section. For this story, the other parties involved are my team lead (TL) and discount customer (DC).

This happened yesterday near the end of my shift. It was the first time that I opened my department on my own (and had little idea of opening procedure, thanks manager!). Anyways, by the time I interact with DC, I have neared wits-end with running around, answering calls, and other stuff. My first encounter with DC (and her husband) was over by our lawn &amp; garden section.

DC was ok at first, where she asked me if we had couplers for the larger-sized garden edging. She had already taken a look at what was hanging up, which was just couplers for the smaller version. I told her I'd take a look outside and see if we had any in our garden center (doubtful, but with how unorganized our store is, possible). Ultimately couldn't find it and told her and thought that was the last of her. Nope.

About 10 minutes later as I was walking to the front of the store after selling 2 guys a lawn mower (box and cart in toe), DC had one ""final"" question for me.

DC: ""Do you think we could get a discount on one of your hoses? The hose is all out of the package.""

Me: ""Yeah, we usually do manager markdowns on those. I'll call my team lead and see what we can do!""

*call over to team lead and explain the situation*

TL: ""For markdowns, we usually do 10% off of the price. Is it just out of the packaging?""

Me: ""Yeah, that's what the customer said.""

TL: ""Then yeah, just the 10% is all we can do.""

I explain this to DC, but she's was damn adamant about getting a larger price cut as we walked over and showed me the hose. Upon looking at it, it really wasn't that bad. It was one of those flex houses and all that was wrong was that someone opened the plastic top and maybe 2 feet of hose was on the outside of the packaging.

Me: ""Yeah, the 10% is gonna be the usual markdown we're gonna do.""

DC: ""But can you tell you guy that I'll **for sure** buy this if you give me 20% off??""

Me: ""I'm sorry but it sounded like 10% was the final offer.""

DC: ""Oh give him another call, it doesn't hurt!"" (cue my brain being exasperated that it isn't getting through her that 10% is the FINAL word)

Me: *standing awkwardly wanting this to go away* ""Hey TL, are you **sure** that 10% is the final discount?""

TL: ""Yes, yes 10% is all we can do!""

After conveying this to DC, she shrugged her shoulders and walked away because she didn't want to buy one out of the box that badly (huge eye-roll).

glamsterhamster,Preteen girl couldn't afford what she wanted,"I work in a fashion store at the mall that also sells a few housewares. This happened last week, I think around my third day on till as I'm relatively new.

A young girl comes in buying a couple things, a shirt and a water bottle, the kind that looks like a cup with a straw but reusable (just looked up and they're called tumblers lol). 

We have a store app like a membership card, I don't promote it to every customer but I decide to do it with her for some reason. 

Me: You can get 20% off if you download it now

Her: I already have it

Me: Oh, then would you like to bring it up on your phone? You can get 10% off (I assumed she already used it once and the 20% is only the first purchase)

She brings it up but the code I have to enter is not showing up, which I'd never seen before.

Me: Hmm, I'm not quite sure why it's not showing up

Her: Oh, I don't have wifi

Me: Oh, that's alright then

I tell her the total and she digs through her wallet for cash, then tells me she won't get the tumbler. I say alright and put it on the back counter.

A few customers later, she comes back, with the tumbler again. She counts out cash and a bunch of change and I help her count it out, but she's short by a few dollars. 

Her: I'll come back

Me: No problem

I put the tumbler on the back counter. A few customers later, she's back, with the same tumbler, again, and we go through the counting out change again, but she's still about 65 cents short. This whole time she kept calm and didn't show any sign of being upset.

Me: If you go find wifi, you could load up the app and get 10% off, then you'd have enough

Her: How much would it be with the 10% off?

Me: *applies the discount to check* it'd be $13.00, so you'd have enough

Her: Okay

She leaves, I put the tumbler on the back counter, and a while later, she comes back with another. The app works, and she actually hasn't used it before so she gets the 20% off, and the total ends up being $11 something. Three tumblers on the back counter, and the fourth hers to keep :)",TalesFromRetail,3257,1560888147
jellam1711,Woman wants a return so bad she blames her dead friend.,"Hi everyone this is my first post ever so I hope it's ok.

This story isn't mine but a friend I work with. We work in a clothing store and changed our returns policy so that customers only had two weeks to bring anything back. This wasn't a problem for most people as we made sure to let them know.

Story:
So this happened a few weeks ago and I have since seen the woman, she frequently tries to return items for stupid reasons.
She came in and was served by my friend who was very polite in telling her that her receipt was out of date.

Friend: I'm sorry mam we will be unable to give you the return as your receipt is out of date.

Lady: well I wasn't made aware of this change so it's not my fault (policy clearly displayed on every till).

Friend: I'm really sorry mam but there is nothing I can d-

Lady: go get me a manager this is unacceptable!

My friend not wanting to cause a scene goes to get the manager.

Manager: what seems to be the issue here.

Lady: this man won't refund my items and they are only a week past the date.

Manager: I'm sorry but due to our policy we cannot return the items.

Lady: but it's only a week late what was I supposed to do my friend died from cancer and I couldn't bring them back.

Friend (visibly upset): we are very sorry about you're loss but there is nothing we can do.

The lady continues to complain to the point my friend was nearly in tears, my manager notices and does the refund purely so the woman will leave, she walks out going ""I'll never come here again"" and promptly complains about our staff.

Yet behold, a few weeks later she's back trying the same thing again, but this time she deals with me. Sorry mam you ain't getting nothing back today.",TalesFromRetail,996,1560867061
MatticusPrime127,An Italian man was really embarrassed that I could understand him when he was cursing me out.,"So I work at customer service at a small grocery store I'm also the whitest Italian you'll ever meet. 

So it was towards the end of the day and I was doing my usual closing routine when an older Italian man wanders up to the desk and starts to angrily call for someone to refund an item. 

( I apologise if I butcher the italian, I'm an amateur lol) 

Me = me 
AM = angry man 

Me- Hi, how can I help you?

AM - IM SICK OF THIS STORE, THESE POTATOS ARE ROTTEN. 

Me- I see, can I see the receipt for them?

AM-  questo negozio è fottutamente terribile! 
(This store is a fucking terrible!)

AM-  il proprietario è un maiale, dovresti chiudere!
(The owner of this store is a pig and you should close!)

Me- I'm sorry to hear that :/ do you want a refund?

AM- Si, cazzo idiota
(Yes you fucking idiot) 

Me- Si, una momenta per piacere :) 
(Sure, one moment please :)

AM- ...tu capisci io?
(You understand me?)

Me- Si, io Sono Italiano, now I need to see your receipt still. (yes, I am Italian)

(At this point his face turned bright red and he seemed really uncomfortable being there.)

AM- No, no I do not. I'm done with this store.

nick_nat,Potatoes aren't all the same!!,"I work in a well known supermarket chain and one morning a lady comes and asks me where she could find potatoes. I politely take her over to them and show her the loose ones becuase i personally prefer to choose my own. She tells me that its not what she's after, she said she's after packet potatoes. So of course i pointed out that they were right next to the loose ones. The woman gets more agitated and says no, i want packet potatoes! I politely tell her the range we have ect. Evidently this wasnt good enough for the woman as she's more frustrated and tells me she wanted the mash potatoes  (pre made in a plastic packaging sorta thing) i politely take her to them an tell her that if she was more specific, I'd of been able to help her more easily! Still didnt stop her giving me grief though. Apparently i should of been able to read her mind and guess what form of potatoes she was going on about!

Cat008101,Women wants homeless man kicked out of charity shop,"Short story from when I volunteered at a charity op shop.

The shop I volunteered at was 100% non profit so what little money that was made went to the homeless and at risk youth The shop mainly sold things like blankets children's cloths and non luxury items and the majority of people of people who shopped there where below the poverty line or straight up homeless. 

Greta= Mean old bag in her 60's Homeless guy= Homeless guy and Me= Me 

A nicely dressed women walks up to the counter and in a louder then normal voice say Greta ""You there get off your phone and go see if you have and cookie jars"" I was not even on my phone my phone was in my pocket and I was making eye contact be for she spoke.

Me ""There are some (3) on the shelf just there"" points to a shelf not even 10ft away.

Greta \*huffs like Im an idiot\* ""I don't want any of those Im looking for collectable ones""

Me ""Sorry that's all we have, we may have some collectable biscuit tins though""

Greta ""Im not after a stupid tin Im looking for vintage novelty cookie jars.""

Me ""sorr' \*cut off by her demanding I ""go look out the back.""

Me ""There is no out the back that's all we have."" We immediately put all donated items on the shelf.

Greta ""I know there's a backroom."" storms off

Immediately after she walked to the back of the very small store a homeless man walks up and askes if we could hold some items till he could afford them. The items where a blanket, a beanie and a reusable water bottle. He said he could pay $3 now and get the rest later, The total was $7. 

I was about to tell him the $3 would be enough to cover all of it when we both here. "" Why put your grubby hands on them if you knew you couldn't afford it. And you \*looks at me\* why haven't you kicked him out, doesn't this store have any class.""- Greta Before I could say a thing ""You lied to me there is a back area."" Points to a exit to a close court area we share with another business.

Me to the homeless guy ""would you like a bag of bread as well"" we give out free bread. he tried to give me his $3 but I told him it was free and to be safe. 

Meanwhile the lady has been swapping between trying to talk over me and mumbling how she knew people who would get me fired. The homeless guy left and I turned my attention back to Greta but she had already walked up to the backdoor that said staff only and made a self congratulating noise as she rush through the door to the court yard and let it slam behind herself. A important thing about the door is you can only open it from inside. I heard immediately a muffled strand of insults and let me in. My plain was to wait 5 minutes but less then 1 minute passed and I cod hear the other business let her throw there way followed by a phone call telling me how Greta when off at them and how she would have us shut down.

_ieclipse,"""Get Out""","I work at a department store in a mall. Our store usually closes at 9, and there's always one or two people who come in last minute, but that's not a huge deal. 

However, a couple months ago, there were three ladies who came up to my group of registers around 8:30 PM with two shopping carts full of merchandise. They were the only people who had come up within the previous hour, so I figured this would be a fairly simple transaction and would only take 15 minutes tops. 

I was very wrong. 

When I rang up the first item, immediately one of them says ""Can I have a price"". I told them the price, and because it happened to be higher than 10 dollars, she responded with a stern ""I don't want that"". This transaction continued for over an hour, every item there was something wrong, or the price was a penny too high. At 9:45 I snapped, and thankfully did not have a name tag- I basically told them to pay with card and leave. 

They started with two carts of merchandise, and left with maybe half of a cart with bagged merchandise. Some people.",TalesFromRetail,873,1560611620
Knever,Lady gets mad when I don't tell her how much money I'm handling.,"I worked at a game store. We had a policy of doing cash drops whenever the register got to +$600. Take money from the register, log it, and put it in the safe. We're not supposed to do it with customers in the store.

During the holidays, it gets pretty busy, so sometimes we need to break the no-customers rule in favor of not having a large amount of cash in the registers.

Last holiday season, I'm working with my manager. Later in the day, my register prompts me to do a cash drop. I dismiss the prompt (which is allowed) to wait for a less busy time to do the drop, but the rush just doesn't stop. Eventually, my manager says to do it after I finish my current customer.

So I finish with my customer and have to tell the next customer to please wait as they're walking up to me, while not having been called (side rant; I really hate it when people come up before being called. We have a queue sign that says ""Please wait to be called"" but apparently some people are too important to pay attention to signs, and yes I'm in the US because apparently me using the word ""queue"" makes everyone think I'm from the UK or something lol).

I open the register, quickly take out the big bills and a chunk of 20's, and crouch down behind the counter to quickly count it.

""How much money ya got there?"" she asks. I'd love to say her name was Karen, but it probably wasn't. We did have a Karen who was a regular. A regular pain in the neck.

She'll be Marpit. I don't even know where she came from, but there she was. I didn't really know how to respond. I should have just ignored her, but my customer service experience taught me not to leave a customer hanging, so I thought it was proper to at least respond.

""Uh, sorry, I can't tell you that,"" I say and try to go back to counting. I may as well have said that her mother was rotting in hell.

""Excuse me?!"" Marpit says. ""It's not like I'm going to try to steal it or anything!""

This catches the attention of my manager, who steps in and says, ""Ma'am, he can't talk right now, if you're ready to check out, please line up over there,"" pointing to the queue.

Marpit wants to talk back, though.

""I was just asking how much money there was, I was just curious, GOD!"" she barks.

I think at this point she said she was going to wait outside (to whomever she was there with) and left.

I finished the drop and my manager asked me, ""Did she actually ask how much money you were handling?""

I shrugged as some of the other customers commented on how stupid Marpit was.

black_linings,Customer blew smoke in my face after telling her about my asthma...,"Just a quick introduction, I am new to reddit and I am sure I will be frequenting this subreddit regularly as I have a new story every day it seems. Anyways, this is one of my most memorable that happened not even a month ago. 

I work at a very large thrift store chain, and on this particular day I was outside accepting donations from donors and handing out coupons as a thanks. Unfortunately I have rather severe asthma, so this job can be difficult for me if I work too hard, and so I try to avoid strenuous work. 

Weekends are extremely busy and difficult and I had a history of asthma attacks on weekend days, especially in the heat. So to my surprise and frustration, a woman was smoking in her vehicle right in the donation center area. Not only is this rude imo, but it is illegal, as you aren't supposed to smoke within 9 meters of an entrance where I am from. She ALSO had an infant in the car with her, another time she broke the law here (it is against the law to smoke in a vehicle with anyone under 18). 

So anyways, I ask this lady as politely as I can to please smoke on the other side of the building as the smoke is bothering my asthma while I am working. She ignores me so I think nothing of it and just accept that I will have to work in smoke for a few more minutes, which is not out of the ordinary unfortunately. I continue my work, accepting donations as there is no time to spare on the weekends and I totally forget about the lady in the car. 

Clearly my request was not acceptable though, as I wasn't paying attention this... this lovely lady stood right beside me and snaps, ""It was f-ing better in my car, wasn't it?"", takes a huge puff of her cancer stick, and blows it directly in my face. 

Now I am not the best employee when it comes to customer service, so instead of clocking this woman in the jaw, I take a breath, and call my manager. She comes running, knowing that I don't usually call unless I really need it. She comes to the lady screaming profanities in my face and pointing at me, though for some reason I couldn't help but smile... Maybe because I am so used to customer abuse by now that I have to laugh it off. 

My manager politely asks her to leave (as much as she could over the screaming), until this lady decides to threaten me. Well, guess what, she got her ass banned from the store. Good job lady, was it worth it? I sure hope so. And I hope your life is just as good as your attitude.",TalesFromRetail,1302,1560566513

Zeekfox,Posting this one for a coworker from yesterday.,"Retail store.  Coworker is a cashier.  Three ladies approach her register with a piece of luggage.  Rather than hold up the luggage so the cashier can scan it, one of them ""rips"" the price ticket off and puts it on the counter.  

The cashier looks at the ticket.  $21.99.  ""Ma'am, this isn't the correct ticket for that piece of luggage.""  Customer and her friends proceed to argue that it came off the luggage and that it was definitely the price of it.  Cashier then proceeds to call the manager for help.  

Manager shows up.  He looks at the ticket and says no, also providing the evidence that the ticket says ""Duffle"" on it instead of luggage.  The ladies continue to press the issue, saying that it was the price on the luggage and that we HAVE to honor it!  They also got rather antagonistic, thinking that if they created enough of a scene that someone would cave and just sell it to them just to make them go away.  Manager was having none of that.  The ladies leave, but not before commenting that they were going to [larger competing store] instead.  Yeah, good luck.  

Manager went to the duffle bag area and found not only the duffle missing its ticket, but the original $64.99 ticket for the luggage piece.  Cashier got a company recognition card for her good work at the register.",TalesFromRetail,1304,1560471286
Alexandraisamazi,The deli is not a safe place for you to work!,"A couple years ago I worked for a grocery store in the deli. A chain that’s known for fresh produce. I had been in the deli about 6 months at the time this happened. I’ve also done first aid and CPR training. (Important I promise)

So in the deli we have huge meat slicers, knives, and the works everywhere. This new girl started about a month prior. She took awhile to train. She didn’t understand the way to put meat on and what direction it should face. Or that you shouldn’t open a new one above a trash can. Poor girl wasted so many pounds of good meat. Enough background and context, let me tell you about this faithful day.

It’s a Sunday. Our busiest day of the week. We are the only Deli in the area that sells this high end particular brand of deli meat. So needless to say we are slammed. Every sliver has someone on it and we have about 8 meat and 1 cheese slicer. I look at my coworker we will call Beth (not her real name for obvious reasons.) She isn’t looking well. I can’t remember what was off exactly. I just remember one of her arms twitching. After I finished with a customer I asked her to help me lift something when she is done. Basically just an excuse for me to get her off the line and in the back where I can ask her if she is okay. I ask and she basically says that no, she’s not okay. I inquire about what’s wrong, does she have any condition that’s causing her pain etc...  Beth informs me that she has MS, it’s been acting up lately, and she has seizures. I ask her to lay on the ground. Not the cleanest thing, but having her lay down is better than her standing. I call my manager, they get to the deli as soon as they can, and she starts seizing. I’ve never witnessed a seizure but it was scary. I just moved everything out of her way that she could get hurt on and waited for the ambulance to arrive. I talked to the paramedic and they take her away after I got her things for her. She didn’t know anyone’s phone number. 

When she came back from the hospital, which was 2 days later, I ask her if she thought the deli was a safe place for her to work. I also talked to the deli manager when he came in. She transferred to bagger. But please, if you have seizures, or a condition that can make you have one, do NOT work in the deli or anywhere around sharp and heavy equipment. It is not safe. Had I not pulled her to the back she would have had one while working a slicer, which is extremely sharp as we sharpened them regularly.

aKamikazePilot,"No sir, I can't give a $115 pump as compensation for us being out of our $50 sale pump (which hasn't even gone on sale yet)!","I've had my fair share of customers that I've dreaded helping out due to their attitudes or other characteristics, but this was the first time I had one of the weirdest conversations and people that could honestly be a true ""TaleFromRetail"". This all happened yesterday at my farm (and other departments) retail store.

I work in the hardware and farm section, and in the mornings there's only 3 of us working this section of the store (doesn't sound bad, but that's about 1/3 of the store, which is the size of a huge warehouse). For this tale, the main people are the weird customer (WC) and my team lead (TL).

We heard on the radio that WC needed some help with one of the tractors that didn't have a price sheet on it, so I offered to go over and help. WC wasn't bad at first, and was asking basic stuff about price, who made the engine, and so on. Eventually, he asked me about some sump pump that he saw in our ad that was on sale for $49. I did not remember seeing anything about it and we headed over to the aisle. No sales sticker was on tag and we were also out of it. In my mind, I had a feeling that it was our upcoming ad, but either way I told him and showed him on our inventory phone that we were out.

Me: ""I'm sorry, it looks like we are out, and I don't think there's a sale going on for it yet.""

WC: ""What?? Well there's this 1/3 hp one right next to it, you should give me this one for the same price since you're out.""

As the title says, that pump was $115. There was a millisecond where I thought about laughing and was thinking the guy wasn't serious. The serious look on his face and a shake of his head made me put that idea away. With how this guy was, I decided to call my TL over since WC kept on wanting to get a deal on this pump (not gonna happen sir).

All this time, WC is complaining about having to drive all the way from the town of ""Dark Prairie"" to get all these things on sale. The thing is, Dark Prairie is only a 15-20 minute drive away (cue inner eye-roll). Now my TL arrives.

TL: ""Hello sir, how can I help you?""

WC: ""Well I saw this sump pump in your ad for $50 and you don't have anymore, I'd like to get this other one for the same price.""

TL: ""Did you just get that ad? Because that's only for this upcoming Friday...""

WC: ""Well it should be like the grocery stores, it should start on Wednesday like them!""

TL: ""I'm sorry, but I can't give you that other one nor could I give you any for $50 since the ad doesn't start yet. I'm sorry but you gotta read the dates on the ad."" *this last line given with a huge shrug* 

Upon hearing this, WC immediately walks away without a word, leaving me and my TL just speechless. WC tried to talk to my TL later about other stuff on sale, and my TL mainly repeated that last line from above. After finding **one** thing he wanted on sale, he and TL were walking to the front, with me following behind.

WC: ""Yeah, he should definitely have the rest of the day off (referring to me).""

While this was said in a joking manner, my mind just thought ""Yeah, you're the reason I'd want the rest of this day off.""",TalesFromRetail,1348,1560427979
LBTT,Hey! You have customers waiting!,"I work at a satellite gas station for a grocery store chain in the eastern US.  It’s just me out there working.  I’ve just started my shift when a customer appears at my window and explains to me that she left her pump running and unattended and that it hadn’t auto shut off and so she spilled “a little” gas on the ground.

Okay.  Nothing a little kitty litter can’t handle.  I immediately move to clean up the spill.

When I get over there, the spill is massive!  There is a pool on the concrete even!  It’s so big that it’s just shy of needing to call someone in to clean it.

Before I can say don’t, the lady is in her car and driving off.  That, in and of itself, could have ignited the gas.  This is a bit more dangerous.

Thankfully, we have a plan of action for this situation.  I spread out what little kitty litter I had on the spill and go back for the big spill stuff.

It’s a guard to keep it from spreading and a fine powder that does what the kitty litter does but quicker and it takes far less and actually expands as it wicks the liquid up.

Anyway, I go to grab that and notice that people are waiting at my window.  It takes half a second to decide: work with the customers or avoid a potential fire at a gas station.

As I’m walking away with the spill kit stuff the guy in the front asks what’s going on and I inform him that there is a massive spill that needs cleaning.  I continue walking.  He then calls rather angered: “Hey!  You’ve got customers waiting.”

Really!?  I hadn’t noticed. “Yes sir,” I call back not stoping, “I also have an explosion hazard.”

You know.  A massive explosion that could potentially hurt everyone in the immediate area including the customers waiting.

He didn’t like this answer and follows behind me spouting off some nonsense that I had stopped listening to at the time.  We get over there and he can clearly see the issue but instead of calming down, I here him say how ridiculous it was that I left customers standing there and that he was going to talk to my manager.

I got the spill under control and left the soaking stuff to do it’s work and went back.  Those people waiting had left.  A couple had decided to pay at the pump but a couple had actually left.  I went back into the kiosk and called my boss.

My boss told me I had done the right thing and that I wouldn’t get in trouble.

To the left we have a customer service desk  and directly opposite our paint aisles (and a lot more beyond that but un-needed for this story) you actually need to come in to store, go towards the paint aisles then turn around to get to the desk.  


And we always have a manager (M) close-ish as when stuff needs refunding it needs a second authorization 

Customer (C) comes through our doors, at enough pace to hit the automatic gates. Instantly goes to our Customer Service desk.  
Me: (yorkshire accent) You alright? is there anything I can help you with?

C: Where is your paint?

Me: Pardon? (Genuine confusion, you can't miss the paint)

C: (slower and louder) WHERE IS YOUR PAINT?

C: What do you think you're doing?

Me: showing you the paint... (steps out behind desk and moves behind her so she turns around)

C: You should never point! it's rude!

Me: I do apologise madam, just your question caught me a little... off-guard and I forgot my manners for a second.

C: MADAM, DO I LOOK LIKE A MADAM?

EmzeeRosee,Why can't I buy that already sold TV?!,"You know, I'm not even mad at this customer. I'm just concerned for their mental state.

Today was a public holiday in Australia and unfortunantly I was rostered on despite not volunteering. I didn't mind because of the pay rates, but at the same time I knew today was going to be a nightmare.

I was right.

Ten minutes into my shift, I had a pair of men come up to me asking to purchase one of our 65"" TVs. These men didn't expect to buy a TV today, and were not prepared to see that we had a really good deal so they were discussing options on how they could take it home since their car wasn't big enough to fit a large TV inside. Since I wouldn't be able to do a home delivery until early next week, I happily agreed to let them pay for it but keep it behind the counter with me while they went to borrow their friends car which was big enough to fit the TV into. I do this occasionally as there is no real harm with it - customers know that anything behind the counter is not to be touched and is store business. Well, usually this is the case.

Instead, here Karen comes in. Typical older woman with the mission of ruining everyone's happiness. Twenty minutes after these guys left I come back to my counter (I ducked out the back really quickly to speak to my manager about something) to see Karen pulling on the 65"" TV by herself as a young teenage girl looks on behind her.

Me: ""Excuse me ma'am, but you can't touch that."" I called out to her immediately. ""Would you also mind stepping out of here please, this area is for staff only.""

Karen: ""Oh, sorry. Its just there are no more of the 65"" TVs on the shelf and I wanted one. I saw it here so I was just going to take it to save you from looking.""

Me: ""I appreciate it, but this TV is actually being picked up soon, it's already been sold. I can have a look if we have any more though. ""

I was kind of annoyed as this woman had ignored the obvious separation between the shop floor and the staff area and had stepped into my work area where she could have touched or damaged our equipment she isn't trained to use. The TV itself also weighs about 40kg and this woman was smaller than me and I struggle pulling it myself, she could have tilted it the wrong way and let the box fall which would have damaged the screen. I wanted to avoid a disagreement since I basically told this woman to 'eff-off' and since the public holiday rush had died down a little I decided to see if I could get another TV for her. I normally wouldn't do that when it was more than a little busy since these TVs were really heavy and I'm not strong enough to get them off pallets by myself. I bring Karen over to my computer and I check our system where it appears we only have 1 in stock. It was the display, meaning we didn't have any left. Oh how I love my luck.

Me: ""I'm sorry but we don't have any more in stock in the moment, I can check any other nearby stores if you'd like, (nearby branch) is only 10 minutes away""

Karen: ""No, I can't travel there. I needed it from here, can't I just take this one and you can send those other people to the other store""

Me: ""No, sorry but they've already purchased the TV and it is theirs. Is there any other TV you were interested in? We also have the (other brand) 65"" TVs. ""

Karen: ""No! I want THIS one.""

At this point I genuinely didn't know what to do, I had told her multiple times that the TV was sold and I was polite in telling her that she couldn't take it yet Karen was only getting annoyed and the teenage girl with her was over at the phone cases we sell and was visibly grabbing random ones, looking at them and dropping them to the bottom of the shelf instead of putting them back.

Me:  ""You can't have this TV, it isn't for sale. I think (other retail store in centre) sells them, go check with them""

Luckily Karen only gave a exaggerated sigh and stormed off. The two guys came in about twenty minutes later to pick up their TV and they thanked me for being a ""lifesaver"" for allowing them to do that.

I guess in public holidays, you win some and you lose some.

I hope Karen didn't get her TV.",TalesFromRetail,1875,1560164915
moods-,Customer thinks he’s a genius for discovering a loophole,"Back when I started at Family-Friendly Retail Store That’s Known for Its Flip Flops, we had signs on all of the registers that said “If we don’t ask you to sign up for our store credit card during your transaction, you get a $5 gift card free!”

I had a middle age man come through my line and buy some items. I asked him if he wanted to sign up for our credit card, and he declined. I proceed to tell him his total and he pays. Then he then reads the little sign we have on our registers informing them of the free $5 gift card if I didn’t ask him to sign up for our credit card.

He checks out and goes to our section near our register where all of our impulse items are: Candy, trinkets, keychains, dog toys, etc. About 5 minutes later, he comes back to my line with a small toy that cost a few dollars.

Because I just offered him the credit card, I didn’t ask him this time if he wanted to sign up for one. You see where this is heading. He walks up to my manager and demands a $5 gift card because I didn’t offer him the opportunity to sign up for our credit card during this transaction.

Honestly...to spend a few dollars just to get a free $5 gift card and think that you’re honestly sticking it to the man...wow.🙄",TalesFromRetail,1790,1560117284

&gt;L: Hi! I'm looking for a box of chocolate.
&gt;Me: okay, sure! is there a specific one you're looking for?
&gt;L: Yes. i need some chocolate for boys. i'm going to bring it to my grandson.

of course, i have zero idea what this means.

Neurotica_XOXO,Crazy lady doesn't know what brushstrokes are and tries to frustrate me into giving a discount.,"I sell art prints. In this story I was at a convention. In my booth I'll hangup 3-5 of each print (packaged in clear plastic) and have a few prints in frames for display. The rest of my stock I keep unpackaged under my table. The girl in the story is like 19-20, nerdy looking, tall and lanky with dark hair and and thick rim glasses. She talks like she's shy and nervous but her actions say otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

So this girl comes up to me with a print in her hand and points to a spot and says ""this is damaged"" 

Okay, fine, that happens sometimes when they're out. I look to where she points and see nothing. 

I say ""I don't see anything"" but she assures me there's a speck. I figure maybe my eyesight sucks so I thank her, grab the print and put it under the table to examine more carefully later and possibly fix.

She pauses for a second, like waiting for me to say something else and then turns around and goes back to where the others are hung up. She grabs the two remaining and stares closely at each print. She puts her face like half an inch from each print and her breath fogs up the package.

She brings them up to me and says these are damaged too. I again see nothing. I take them out of plastic to show her (maybe she's seeing something on the plastic?) Nope, she still sees specks (allegedly in different places on each print.) I try to explain to her that she might be looking at brushstrokes, but no. She assures me they're all damaged.

&amp;#x200B;

At the time I thought she was just picky. In hindsight I'm pretty sure she was trying to get a discount for a ""damaged"" product. When she started this game she probably didn't realize I don't put up all my product and I have hundreds of prints in my stock. You'd think me pulling up a heavy box full of prints would make her reevaluate her plan, but no. She was determined af.

&amp;#x200B;

This chick made me individually go through my entire fucking stock, like 70 prints. Examining each print like some fucking art detective. Each time nervously laughing and saying ""Sorry... I'm sorry."" Each one had something wrong with it, something only she could see:

*""A corner is bent/frayed"" - you won't see it in the frame. -No.*

*""It's scratched."" - I'm pretty sure that's a brush stroke and part of the picture. Feel it, you can't feel a scratch. -No.*

*""There's a mark on it"" - It's coated, you can just wipe it off. -No.*

*""There's a fingerprint on it"" - That's because I just touched it, it wipes off. -No.*

*""There's a speck"" - that's PART OF THE PICTURE -No.*

I wanted to SO BADLY tell her to get the fuck out of my booth. 

After 40 minutes of this we get to the last print, and of course she says there's something wrong with it, then looks at me expecting me to come up with some solution to her imaginary problem, to offer her a discount because somehow all my products are damaged and nobody but her has ever noticed.

I just said ""Oh well"" and started putting the prints away. 

She paid full price for the 3rd print I showed her. 

I did not offer her a business card or ask if she'd like the artist to sign it.",TalesFromRetail,1979,1560022107
Rathbane12,Ten minutes of my life I want back,"Alright, so this happened about a year and a half ago so around Christmas 2017 and it will always stick with me. 

I work in the scrapbooking section of a craft and hobby store.  Anyways, the phone rings and I pick it up. The lady on the other end says they’re restoring a RV from the 70s and are currently working on the lazy Susan. I explain we unfortunately don’t have anything suitable for that.  

She then says she saw the metal extension posts on the website and says they’re what she needs.  

I explain they’re used for expanding post bound scrapbooks and are not strong enough nor appropriate for lazy Susans.  

She insisted that they’re the right thing. So I spend The next five minutes explaining to her what exactly these things look like despite her having a picture on the website. She wants to know everything. Price. How many are in the package. Their color (silver. I had to tell her about five times they were silver...freaking silver) , the mechanics of how they screw together. 

When it’s all said in done she’s still clueless but still thanks me.  When it’s done I groan and literally face palm. 


Cut to thirty minutes later.  

Another phone call.....it’s the same lady. 


She wants me to reconfirm everything we just talked about so she can tell her husband what to look for when she sends him there. 

Cue another five minutes of me describing things again, price, how many are in a package, color (for those of you who forgot...silver) , and the mechanics of how they screw together. 

Once again she thanks me and is just as clueless.  

I then proceeded to walk to the break room, go into one the employee restrooms, and unleash a loud primal scream. 

The two coworkers I scared the crap out of asked if I was okay. I said yeah but deep down I was afraid I may have damaged my vocal cords.  


Two hours later an old guy comes in, and you guessed it, asked where the scrap book extension posts are. I show him them and go about my business cleaning my department. 

He pulls out his cellphone and preceded to call someone and told them, ‘No, these aren’t what we need. ‘

I wanted to cry.

legenddarkrai,My store loses all power in the middle of the night,"I'm a part time cashier at my local grocery store, and they normally have me on the closing shift 3pm-12am, aka midnight, when we officially close. 

The story starts yesterday at about 10:15-10:30pm, after all the non-closing cashiers and shelf stockers leave, so we were left with our customer service manager (CSM), our actual manager (AM), me and one other cashier (OC), and 3 stockers. We were all doing our thing; because we were a smaller store, I was at the register checking out a line of about 5 people, and the other cashier was sweeping up the front. 

I started scanning the next customer's stuff, a bunch of french breads, when all of a sudden, the lights flicker and then everything goes dark, a loud popping sound and alarms start going off, and I'm left with the emergency power powering my register screen, basically blinding me with the bright blue and white UI and the sudden near-absolute darkness. I'm looking around wondering what the hell to do when the actual manager rushes up behind me and tells me to get everyone out the door as soon as possible, which in hindsight was probably to prevent anyone from stealing, causing panic and hurting each other, etc. 

I found out from this event that I actually do really great in high pressure situations, so immediately I start yelling, corralling and ordering all the people in line and getting them out the door alongside AM, who was forcing the doors open to let them out. It actually went rather smoothly, even with a couple kids crying from the shock of it all. After they were all out, I was sent by AM to scour the rest of our store to see if there were any stragglers, so I  fast-walked around the store, looking through each dark aisle to see any silhouettes of confused and/or stealing customers. 

No one was there except a couple customers in the pharmacy area who just turned on their phone flashlight and kept shopping, which was really funny to me, that all they did was turn on a flashlight and continue shopping like nothing happened; they didn't even steal anything, literally just continued shopping! I escorted them out, and thusly the store was empty of customers, and every remaining employee aggregated to the front near the doors, where the emergency power shut down every register, and the only thing illuminating the store at this point were small lights lining the outside rim of the interior of our store. 

AM tells the lot of us to guard the fire exits, which we have three of, in case someone tries to get in or out? Maybe? I honestly don't know the specific reason behind it, but after a while of chatting with the stocker that was guarding one of the fire exits, we get told by OC to get to the front again, where we started making a plan.

&gt;CSM: Okay now that everyone's here, first things first, we need to get some screwdrivers, and board up the doors.

&gt;Everyone laughs from the joke

&gt;AM: Okay but seriously, we need to do something about all the coolers and especially the meat. We do not want that getting warm and lose a ton of money.

&gt;One of the very knowledgeable stockers: We have some seram wrap in the back, we can use that to wrap up the displays to keep them colder for longer.

At that, I agreed to that and immediately followed him to the back room, where AM then tells everyone else to follow us, get some seran wrap, and start wrapping up the middle displays; the displays have the yogurts, the sausages, macaroni salad, etc. 

First thing I do is tell OC to help me out, getting all the bags of flat pretzels off the top. I get a spare cart that was inside the store, and we start loading it up with the bags. After we're done, I tell OC to hold the wrap down while I wrap all the way around, tripping over display crates and a stack of alcohol all the while. 

AM is freaking out over the wall of meats because seram wrap wouldn't hold to make a wall covering it, so they had to improvise; they took cardboard boxes and flattened them, to place on top of the meats to keep them cooler for just a little longer. In the end we had to do the same thing for the juices, the *other* wall of meats near the front, and the open freezer displays next to the wall of door-freezers. 

Me, OC, and another stocker very shoddily wrapped up two displays with the sausages and stuff, covered up the meat, juices, and open freezers. Unfortunately we didn't have nearly enough cardboard boxes to cover everything, so the eggs, bacon, cheeses and their cottage and cream variants, and a few puddings and cakes couldn't be covered up. 

Honestly, from there, we just kind of loitered around until it was time to go home at midnight. We somehow miraculously did all that work within an hour after the power went out. By that time, most of the emergency lights were off because emergency power was running super low, so everything was getting darker and darker. 

The AM had written down all our names to clock us out once the power comes back on, since he, as the top ranking manager at the time, had to stay in the store to keep it ""running"", relatively at least, and to ensure its safety during the blackout. I talked to him when I came into work today, and apparently it was only literally a few minutes after all of us left, so it didn't take much longer for him to do his last duties and then go home. 

I can only imagine the hell that the morning shift had to go through though, putting all the boxes away, cutting up and removing the seram wrap, and putting lowered price stickers and barcodes on *most* of the supposed-to-be cold items, especially the meats. On the bright side, the morning manager praised us for our quick thinking and efficiency in taking care of all our stock. Granted, we didn't cover the cheeses and vegetables.... but I'll take it nonetheless. 

This whole thing was one hell of a team building exercise though! And the most interesting thing to happen in my short, nearly 3 months of working here. It was a lot of fun too, running around a grocery store while it's pitch black.",TalesFromRetail,1096,1559900113

spellstep,Bubbles for kids are dangerous,"This happened about a week ago, with the weather where I live improving I've been asked to demo toys outside are shop to drive up sales. I was showing of a this hand puppet thing that you dip in bubble solution and wave around to make bubbles, it's actually actually good product for young kids.

Anyway as I'm showing it off to a group of passersby an old woman rushes over to me.

OL (old lady): That's really very dangerous!

Me: (confused) I'm sorry, what is?

OL: Those bubbles! They could get in someone's eyes and really hurt them!

Now I've gotten plenty of bubbles in my eyes from my time demoing over the past few weeks. No. They don't hurt.

ComputerGeek1100,"Guy Threatens to Have Me Fired Because I ""Didn't Ask"" Him Something (I Did)","**Background:**

I'm a cashier/self-checkout attendant at a membership-based warehouse store. I've been at this job for two years in July, so I'd like to think I know the policies pretty well, as well as how to explain things to people.

**Cast:**

&gt;Me: Me

&gt;RG: Rude Guy

&gt;NL: Nice Lady, another woman in line who happens to be the mother of someone I've known since elementary school (now in college)

**The Story**:

Tonight, I was on a register 5 minutes after closing, myself and two others taking care of the line of last-minute shoppers as fast as possible.

Anyway, RG is next in line. I scan his membership card and my register says ""CARD EXPIRED RENEW NOW/SURCHARGE WILL APPLY""

At my store, since a membership is required, a 20% surcharge is added to anyone's total whose card is either expired or wants to shop as a non-member.

&gt;Me: It says here that your card is expired.

&gt;RG: WELL WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? YOU'RE CLOSED, RIGHT?

&gt;Me: It would be $55 to renew for the year, but if you choose not to renew your card today, there will be a 20% surcharge on your bill.

&gt;RG: GIVE ME MY CARD

Leaving his items, he storms away. I turn to the next customer and start helping her. She laughs with me and asks if he's leaving. I look down the front line and see that he's stopped at customer service. *Great*.

A few minutes later, he comes back and cuts off NL. When it's his turn, he gives me his card again:

&gt;RG: Customer service said you should have renewed it for me.

*I thought I had made it clear what his options were at the register - looking back, I could have probably been more explicit but he never asked whether or not he could renew at the register, so I assumed he wasn't interested when he yelled and then stormed away.*

*Also, a note about me. I'm not the most confrontational, and sometimes, when I get flustered, I stumble over my words a little. This happened here*.

&gt;Me: I-I apologize, sir-

*I was going to say, ""I didn't realize that what I said was unclear"", but he cut me off*.

&gt;RG: (in a mocking voice) OH, ""I-I-I-I APOLOGIZE""! NO, HOW ABOUT YOU LEARN HOW TO DO YOUR JOB? YOU SHOULD BE FIRED.

At this point, I've lost all respect for the guy and I'm honestly kind of hurt. I can't control that I occasionally stutter when I'm flustered, and it doesn't happen often at all. I decide to keep my mouth shut because I know that any response I have will just escalate the situation further. It's also 15 minutes past closing at this point and I'm really not in the mood to have an argument.

**BONUS**:

For some reason, RG stuck around after his transaction was done, possibly to look for a manager to complain to. Before he gives up on that, one of my coworkers walks by and asks me if I'm working on Saturday (she wanted to switch shifts)

&gt;Me: Yeah, I am.

&gt;RG: Pfft, maybe.

Of course, implying I'd be fired before then. This part didn't even make me mad, it was just hilarious to me.

Anyway, after he left, I had a good laugh with NL, who saw everything and has known me for years. She brightened my mood quite a bit after RG almost ruined my day.",TalesFromRetail,1335,1559616054

A place often frequented by older people and tons of European tourists. I used to work in a store that sold women’s, business casual attire and accessories. A little on the pricey side for my taste, but it was easy work.

It was the end of summer and tax free weekend for back to school shopping. Families with their kids flooded the mall looking for new outfits. I was working the sale floor, going back and forth to clear out the dressing rooms. I was walking back to put a handful of garments back on their racks when I spot an energy drink sitting alone on the perfume display table. Clearly, someone had left it behind, so I picked it up and put it behind the checkout counter for if someone came back to reclaim it. I return to clearing the dressing rooms when a minute later, a tall woman in neon athletic wear stops me. 
“Was there a drink on this table?” She asks me, seeming relatively calm.
I smile and nod. “Yes, I have it up at the counter for you.” I say, and lead her up to the checkout counter. I retrieve the drink and hand it back to her.
Her response to this was not ‘thank you’ but “I was only gone for a second! You saw me put it down!”
I honestly couldn’t tell who had left the drink there because the store had more customers than usual and I was focusing on putting away clothes.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t see you put it down. I just happened to see it on the perfume display and went to hold it for you. I apologize if it caused some confusion.” I say with genuine politeness.
The woman glares at me. “Yes you did!” She snaps. “You were right there when I walked away! You saw! A second later it was gone!”
It’s at this point I see that this woman is blowing the situation out of proportion. I sigh and continue to be as polite as I can.
“I honestly didn’t see you, ma’am. It’s a bit busier than normal.”
She’s clearly not accepting my apology. “You don’t talk to me with that attitude! You saw!You’re a little rat going around and stealing from customers! You should be ashamed! You’re lucky I don’t report you!” The woman then turns and leaves in a huff.
“I hope your day gets a little better, ma’am.” I call out to her.
Luckily, my manager was at a register behind me and witnessed the outburst.
She rolls her eyes and looks at me sympathetically.
Needless to say, we never saw that woman again. Hope she gets over her caffeine addiction because it seems like it’s messing with her nerves too much.",TalesFromRetail,836,1559507793
BigBuda,Boy I feel like a jerk.,"Yesterday I was puttering along on my switch when a customer walks in. It's an old lady who comes in fairly often and I say my normal greeting while internally thinking to myself, oh god it's her, she always talks to me too long. Well she goes and grabs her item and come up to the register and we talk for a bit and she hits me with this.

Old Lady: I better get back to (retirement comunity/nursinghome), it would be nice to go back to a house and a family. I'm so glad you talk to me

Me: *screaming internally* well I hope you have a good day.

Old lady: I admit I was a little depressed when I first got there but I've made some friends. And you are always so nice to me when I come here.

I don't know what's worse, either this lady doesn't have any family left or her kids just dumped her in a home and dipped.

euphorickittty,Why isn't a store you don't work at not answering the phone?,"I worked as a manager for a popular chain cafe for many years. This is by far one of the most bizarre calls I've ever had (and as others in food service management can attest, we get a LOT of crazy calls...).  


CC: Crazy Customer. Me: Me   


CC: Hi, I've been trying to call \[store in a completely different city\] and no one is answering. What's going on? Are they open?  
Me: I'm sorry, I'm not sure why they aren't answering. As far as I know, they should be open.   
CC:  Well why aren't they answering the phone??  
Me: I'm not sure.. as I'm not there... it's possible they are quite busy   
since it is dinner rush right now?

CC: Well can you call them and find out what's going on?  
Me: I can, but I've got the same number as you do for them. 

CC: UGH, who's your boss? I'm going to make a complaint!  
Me: ...You're going to complain to \*my\* boss because another store isn't answering the phone? 

CC: YES, you obviously aren't interested in helping me. 

Me: I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm just not sure what you want me to do? I'm not at that store. I have no idea why they aren't answering the phone.   


This went on for a few minutes. I ended up giving her my district manager's name at her insistence. But... he's not even the district manager for that store.. Karen's are so weird. I still have no idea what she wanted me to do? Teleport there and find out what was going on? Or did she think all stores with the same name had a central hive mind and we were in constant telepathic communication?   


TL;DR: It's not even that long... just read it...",TalesFromRetail,1524,1559462834
sarah_caughill,I (16f) was asked out by an older guy the other night..,"So I'm a cashier at a grocery store for background. My store sells beer but I can't legally touch or sell it till I'm 18.

It was around 10:30 at night and I was the only till open, so my manager was hanging close by doing what he needed to get done but still close enough to override any beer that came through.

 These two dirtball-lookin guys came through with only beer and one of them had cans in his pocket that he was loading onto the belt (I don't know why he didn't just use a basket but whatever)

I called my manager, he came over and I stepped back and stood at the end of the till (where you'd stand to bag). He was doin his thing and the guy that had the beer in his pockets was making jokes about how he wasn't stealing and showing his pockets and I just did the typical customer service laugh cause this guy seemed to think he was being hilarious.

His friend was paying and this guy continued to make jokes, walked around near me and lifted his shirt, still joking that he ""didn't have beer hidden anywhere"" I think he was tryna flex but he had a small gut and weird slouch lines.

I just look at him and again, customer service laugh. He pauses and looks at me, moves too close for comfort, and asks if I'm single. (He looks to be in his mid 20s but a rough mid 20s with a face tatoo and a skinny fat figure if that makes sense)

My immediate response was 

""I'm 16""

He made the weirdest noise I think I've ever heard, grabbed his beer cause his friend had just paid, and walked faster away than I've ever seen anyone walk without it being a jog or run.

My manager that night was actually one of my best work friends and we both just laughed our asses off when they were gone then went back to business as usual.


Added bonus story, I got a random nosebleed at work today and got to chill out behind the customer service desk for half an hour while someone else filled in for me. That was fun.",TalesFromRetail,696,1559426956

""No, I want a human.""

Kingeh1,DO I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT?,"A few years ago I worked in the airport in an electronic store. The store was massive so each salesperson had their own department and we didn't mingle with other departments.   
Back then I was only 22 and I was working in the digital cameras department. this was over 12 years ago by the way just to put you guys in perspective. 

Smartphones were just beginning to show up and in no way they were popular as they are today. 

One day on a relatively none busy day me and 3 of my friends are waiting for clients to come in to the store. it was between flights so the airport was pretty empty and we had some free time. 

A young woman around the age of 24-25 walks in and slams an automatic translator device on the counter right in front of me. The conversation is going something along these lines:

Young Woman: ""Hello, I bought this last year when I flew abroad and it never worked from the moment I bought it. I want to get a refund or someone to fix it. ""  


Me: ""hmmm Ma'am, this is the photography stand, I can't help you with this and even if this was my department, we don't do customer support in the airport. You can try contacting our customer support and they will help you when you're back home.""  


YW: ""No, that's not good enough. I paid a lot of money for it and it never worked. I want you to fix it now or replace it"".

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""But I don't know how to fix it... and we can't just replace it""

&amp;#x200B;

YW: ""that is your issue. I want you to fix this NOW""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Okay... what is the problem?"" (normally I don't take crap from people, even at work I will put them in their place even if it means to lose a sale. My managers are always okay with it as long as I'm being professional. But this was just when I started working so I didn't have a lot of confidence in myself and also I was extremely bored at work).

&amp;#x200B;

YW:"" It never turned on. Not once from the moment I bought it!""

  
Me: "" Mind if I take a look?""

&amp;#x200B;

YW: ""Go ahead... but it won't work i'm telling you""

&amp;#x200B;

I take the translator device and press the 'On' button. 

  
YW: ""Do you honestly think I never tried to press on? what do I look like? an idiot?""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""What? no... i just tried it""

I continue to examine it. pressing on the 'On' button a couple more times and it's not doing anything. I turn the device over and open the battery chamber

&amp;#x200B;

YW: ""DO I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT WHO WON'T PUT BATTERIES INSIDE???"" she screamed from the top of her lungs. ""DO YOU TREAT ALL YOUR CLIENTS THIS WAY OR IS IT BECAUSE I""M A GIRL?""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Ma'am please relax I never said you're stupid or anything I just want to examine this product""

  
YW: ""THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME JUST REPLACE IT. **IT'S NOT WORKING**""

&amp;#x200B;

I pull out all 3 batteries and look inside. I then turn the batteries around and put them back in. facing the way it shows in the battery chamber. I close the chamber and press 'On'. The device turns on. 

I place the working device on the counter right in front of her. she looks at it with horror. 

no one at the counter is saying a word. then I finally break the silence after like 30 seconds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: It's working now. 

&amp;#x200B;

YW: ""Oh... hmmm err""

&amp;#x200B;

I stand there in silence just smiling. 

  
YW: ""You guys will make fun of me once I go away... aren't you?""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Oh, yes... definitely. so if you don't mind I'm having a real hard time keeping the laughter inside.""

Zeekfox,Had a guy try to return a garden hose.,"Retail store here. We carry mostly clothes, but have some other things too. This time of year, we have a section for outdoor things.  

Customer came in today. He was trying to return a garden hose. Clearly looked used. I work in the loss prevention role at this store, so I don't run the register myself, but I'm right near the customer service desk. Conversation goes as follows-  
Cashier: ""Do you have your receipt for this item?""  
Customer: ""No, I bought it last year. But it doesn't work and there's a warranty on it. So I want to get my money back or exchange it for a new one.""  
(Nevermind that we don't have any more, and haven't since nearly a year ago.)  
Cashier: ""Without a receipt you can only get store credit for the current value of the item.""   She then scans the item for a price lookup. ""And that's only fourty-nine cents since you bought it so long ago.""  
Customer then points to the price on the ticket. ""This is how much I paid for it, and I want a refund for it.""  
Cashier reiterates our store policy on refunds. ""You'd need to have your receipt to get back what you paid for it. We can look up reciepts for customers who lost them, but only if it's from the last thirty days because our system only goes back that far.""  
Customer: ""Well that's not my problem!""  

(I had to stifle a laugh. In my head, I was thinking, ""Uh, yes, that is your problem. It's not our fault you neglected to hold onto the receipt or bring it back in a timely fashion.)  

The cashier didn't really have much else to add here and the guy asked to talk to a manager. Manager comes up and says the exact same thing our cashier said, adding that any sort of warranty on the package would have to be taken up with the manufacturer, not with our store.  

Some of us were laughing about the guy later. We're used to people bringing back items with no receipt and being subjected to any markdowns on said item and being told they can only get $0.49 for something they bought months ago, but the ""That's not my problem!"" exclamation was totally new.",TalesFromRetail,1003,1559303366
psellars2,I will report your closing store,"So I worked for a retail company for a while until they had to shut down. We received the announcement that the company was bankrupt and would be closing all stores. Now once the announcement was made, a policy was implemented that everything would be sold as is. No refunds or exchanges. 

It is also important to note that obviously everything was on sale (50-90% off). MOST of the items rang up the sale price automatically. However, there were some items in which we had to manually change the price, otherwise it would ring up the regular retail price.

On the last day we displayed giant posters all over the store stating that this was the last day that we would be open.

A few more notes before my shift ended I get a call from an irate customer

Customer: I bought this video game. It was supposed to be 75% off but I was charged the full $59.99

So I look up the transaction and sure enough, the employee who checked him out did not charge the right price. So even though we were not supposed to do refunds, I felt that I could make an exception. I also want to note that he had paid with a credit card

Me: I’m sorry about that sir. I do see where the employee accidentally rang up the original price instead of the sale price. Even though we are not supposed to do refunds, I will be more than happy to refund the difference to you. You’ll just need to come back in with the product, the receipt, and your credit card

Customer: I live too far away. Just go ahead and do it over the phone

Me: No sir. I can’t do that. The way our system is set up, I order for me to be able to refund this, you will have to bring the product in with your credit card

Customer: Don’t tell me your system can’t do this! Every computer made within the last 10 years has the capability to where you can go in and edit the transaction. Just go in and change the transaction to charge my credit card the right price

Me: Sir, our computers are 16 years old

Customer: Look...I’m not coming in. You will do this right now without me coming in the store. I am going to check my credit card first thing tomorrow and if I am not refunded the difference I will be reporting you to the Better Business Bureau

At that point, I tried to explain to the man that the ENTIRE company was closing that day but I only got out one word before he started shouting at me (I have no idea what he was saying) and repeated his threat to call the BBB bad he hung up the phone.",TalesFromRetail,1465,1559242276
MagistrateDeTemps,Woman with 100 incorrect coupons probably caused $500 if not more of loss to the store.,"I worked in a grocery chain in Texas that is pretty popular. Chances are, if you’re a Texan, you already know what store I’m talking about.

We had a sale on Marie Calendars or some frozen food brand where if you buy one frozen meal, you get a dessert of the same brand for free, the catch is that it had to be a certain size. They were the smaller variety.

Just as I was about to go home, a woman comes through my line with a bloody cart full of the frozen foods on sale. This was literally all she bought. 200 items, half food, half dessert. It’s so bizarre that I feel like nobody is going to believe me. By this time my bagger dipped out and this woman clearly wasn’t going to help bag so I was trapped. 

After I scanned everything, I went to scan her coupon, but it was denied. The desserts she had bought were large, full pies. 13$. The coupon was only for smaller desserts that were 6$. I decided to just call my manager over. When the woman realized what I was doing, she hastily told me that the “man over there said it was okay.”

Yeah, no he didn’t. But I digress.

My spineless manager made me push through every coupon. That means I had to manually type each coupon. For whatever reason, you can’t do quantities of coupons. I also had to adjust it to where it would take off 13$ instead of 6$.

Lasted a good 15 minutes. What the hell?",TalesFromRetail,2715,1559080800
jssfrk856,"Lady, it's literally my job to know more than you","Many years ago, when I was in high school and shortly after, I worked in a very prominent video game retailer. At the time of this story, Fable: The Lost Chapters had just released for the original Xbox. As it was nearing Christmas, of course many parents were shopping for their children's presents. I enjoyed gaming much more back then, and I also enjoyed reading as much as I could about new releases, so I could be as good at my job as possible.

Well, one fateful day, a Wild Karen appears.

As soon as I was free to help her, I approach her and ask, pleasantly, how I could help her. 

Me: Hi there. How can I help you today?

Karen: I need Fable: The Last Chapter, for Playstation.

Me: I'm sorry. It's actually Fable: The Lost Chapters, and unfortunately it is an Xbox only game.

Karen \[increasingly beligerent\]: No. I saw it. Fable: The LAST CHAPTER for The Playstation 2. It is one of their platinum hits. 

Me: Ma'am, I'm sorry. But the game is made by Microsoft. It is only available for the Microsoft Xbox. I can help you find something similar for the Playstation, though?

Karen: Whatever, you don't know what you're talking about.

The Wild Karen flees.

In my mind, I was screaming at her. ""Lady, I work here. I play these games. I get paid to know more than you do about them. If you knew what you were talking about, you would know that Fable is produced by Microsoft, so it would never be on a Sony system. And you would also know the correct name of the game. And you would also know that Platinum hits are the Microsoft value games. Greatest hits are the Sony value games. Get away from me"". But, being professional, I said nothing and moved on to help the next customer.

valkeriimu,Customer doesn't understand that I need still to ring up the free product for a BOGO,"Basically I work at a pretty large makeup store. One of the brands is currently doing a BOGO where if you buy this little kit, you get a free full sized brow gel from their line, which would normally cost $24 on its own. There are different colors, so the customer gets to pick out live product off the shelf for what color they want and put it in a slot in the box to complete the BOGO. Obviously, as a cashier I need to ring up this product as it is live product, and the computer automatically marks down the price to $0 when it's combined in a transaction with the kit.

Lady comes up and has the BOGO plus two more products. I ring her up, taking the brow gel out of its little spot so I can ring it up, then putting it back in the slot and bagging her stuff.

Lady: No, that's part of the set.

Me: I know, for the BOGO, right? I still have to ring it up for inventory purposes, but you're getting it for free.

Lady: But you rung me up for four things, I only have three. 

Me: I understand, but the BOGO is two items, the kit and the gel have to be rung up separately, so you do have four items.

Lady: But this (indicates brow gel) is a part of this (points to the kit). 

Me: Again, ma'am, I know. But they are still two separate things and I have to ring up the freebie for inventory purposes. Again, you're still getting it for free.

Lady: Then why are you charging me?

Me: The card reader on your side only shows unit price, not the transaction exit price, so the gel is free. That's why your total is only $54.

Lady: But you're charging me!

Me: Ma'am, if I were charging you for the gel, your total would be $78 instead of $54. I must ring up the brow gel for inventory, but the computer is giving it to you for free.

And I'm not quite sure she understood, but she shut up at that point and just paid. I made it a point to hand her the receipt instead of putting it in her bag so she could see that she got the gel for free and was being a dumb-ass who wasn't listening to me. What do people think ""you're getting this for free"" means? that i'm secretly charging you and pocketing the cash?",TalesFromRetail,2156,1559018734
kittenmish,"""I can't possibly have done this, so that makes you stupid""","This is my first post here, and I thought it would be cathartic to share this particular story. It’s been about a week since this happened, and it still stresses me out to think about it. 

I’ve worked in a phone shop in the UK for nearly three years now. An older lady (OL) came in, looking vaguely familiar, and since I was the only sales consultant free I approached her. When she asked for a manager I explained he was busy and asked if there was anything I could help her with, which we’re encouraged to do if the manager is with another customer. At my offer, she came out with this gem. 

&gt;OL: You can help me understand my phone bill, but I hope you’re not one of the stupid ones who work here. 

My jaw almost dropped when she said this, and I saw another customer turn around to stare at her in disbelief. Plastering a smile on my face and keeping my voice as controlled as I could, I said “I can assure you I’m not stupid.” She huffed and handed her phone over to me. 

As I’m loading up the app for the phone network she’s with, she starts complaining about another staff member, and tells me how she complained to the manager “that he was a great big lug with his nails bitten right back”. I suddenly realise where I know her from- she’d been in a month before with a newer member of staff who had been way too blunt and dismissive with her. He’d also explained the phone bill to her, but had gotten really impatient when she didn’t understand what he was explaining to her. At the time, I thought- and still think- he didn’t handle things as well as he could’ve, but I understood why he’d been this way after dealing with her myself. 

This lady could not understand that the reason her phone app now read “JUNE BILL - X AMOUNT” at the top of the screen was because the May bill had been paid. I loaded the May bill up, showed her that the payment date was taken several days earlier, and that the screen now showed the next payment that was to be taken. 

&gt;OL: But I added something to my bill a week ago, and it’s not showing up here.
&gt;Me: The extra £4 charge? Yes, here it is on the May bill. It’s been grouped into the last bill. 
&gt;OL: That’s the second time I got that charge, why? It’s not fair.
&gt;Me: It says here you rang an Irish number on the 21st of April. Ringing Irish numbers isn’t part of any of our phone plans. Do you recognise this number?
&gt;OL: It’s my gardener’s number, but I didn’t ring them.
&gt;Me: Have you been charged before for ringing this number?
&gt;OL: Yes, but I deleted his number last week, so I don’t know why I’ve been charged again.
&gt;Me: If you deleted his number, you’ll still be charged for previous calls you’ve made. 
&gt;OL: (stares at my blankly) I don’t know if I rang him. 
&gt;Me: I’m not sure what to tell you, as it states here that you rang him on the 21st of April. That’s why you have this extra charge.

She muttered something under her breath, which I think might have been “you’re not telling me anything”, but switched to a direct tone. 

&gt;OL: Can you print me off a statement?
&gt;Me: Your phone statement? Yes, I can do that for you no problem.
&gt;OL: No no, not that. I can see that here. I want a bank statement. Can you go to the bank and get me that?
&gt;Me: ...no, I can’t do that. It’s a breach of data protection. There is a bank just around the corner, though, they can print it off for you.
&gt;OL: (throws her hands in the air) Data protection this, data protection that. Why can’t you just get it for me?
&gt;Me: Because the bank wouldn’t allow me to access another person’s statements, and I could lose my job for doing that.
&gt;OL: (huffs) So you’re not going to do anything for me. I thought you were meant to be one of the smart ones?

In nearly five years of working retail, I have never lost my temper or raised my voice to a customer. This time, it took everything in me to keep my voice controlled even though my whole body was shaking with anger. Her words had caught the attention of several of my colleagues and some customers who were staring over in shock at what this wizened old bat had just said, and they could probably see the fury I was holding back. I was done with her.

&gt;Me: I think it's best if you wait for the manager, as I don’t feel I can help you.
&gt;OL: Wait, I just need this explained to me-
&gt;Me: I have been explaining this bill to you and you haven’t been listening to me. With the way you’ve been speaking to me, I cannot deal with you anymore, but my manager will be more than happy to help you.
&gt;OL: But I just need to know where this payment went! 

I took the phone from her, again loaded the May bill, and silently pointed to the date it was taken out. She studied the phone for a moment and then let out a deep breath.

&gt;OL: So it was already taken out, and my next bill is for June? 
&gt;Me: Yes.
&gt;OL: And the extra charge was on the last bill?
&gt;Me: Uh huh.
&gt;OL: That’s all I wanted to know!
&gt;Me: And that is what I’ve explained to you several times. 

She started packing up her things, sighing and laughing to herself, while I stood there with a stony expression. 

&gt;OL: After all that, I think I need to lie down in a darkened room.
&gt;Me: Do you understand your billing queries now?
&gt;OL: Yes yes, I see it now.
&gt;Me: So I’m not stupid, am I?

She looked genuinely surprised at this, as if she’d completely forgotten what she said. My blood was still boiling, and I knew I’d regret it if I didn’t call her out on what she’d said. She put her hand on my wrist and patted it patrionisingly, suddenly smiling. Strangers touching me puts me in a lot of discomfort, so I pulled my hand away from her. 

&gt;OL: (voice now sweet) I’m sorry I said that, dear. You know I didn’t mean it.
&gt;Me: Regardless, you implied I was stupid when I was trying to help you.
&gt;OL: I’m sorry, I’m sorry. It’s just so frustrating when people don’t understand you.

Evidently she didn’t see the irony of her words. She grabbed her bags, thanked me and left, and I went into the storeroom to scream for a few minutes to let off some steam.

When I was speaking to my manager about it later, he was furious at how she spoke to me and mentioned she’d been similarly rude when he’d helped her before. Other staff members congratulated me for keeping my cool, and I thanked them for not stepping in and letting me deal with the situation myself. God knows what she would’ve said about me then. 

My mother asked me later why I didn’t tell the lady that I have two degrees which proves I’m not stupid. I pointed out to her that I shouldn’t have had to flex my education – educated or not, people don’t deserve to be disrespected by crazy old broads who huff and puff through every explanation and don’t listen to you. I’m just praying that the next time she inevitably comes in, I have a good excuse not to serve her. 

tl;dr: lady calls me stupid for her not understanding her phone bill. i lose the last of my faith in humanity.",TalesFromRetail,1182,1558975090
Daiquila,Customer wants discount on clearance. Gets told no 4 times,"This happened yesterday and what took place was probably my weirdest experience with a customer who shall be referred to as CB (choosing beggar).

Its Memorial Day weekend and the store is packed. I was running clothes and helping customers, even though my managers told me not to. I was checking the system to find something for a customer when CB walks up to me. The conversation goes like this

CB: Do you work here?

Me: yes I do.

CB: Okay, is there discount on clearance?

Me: No, clearance doesn't get discounts.

CB: But theres a sign that says jeans are 40% off.

Me: Yes, but those jeans aren't on clearance. 

CB: But I found these clearance jeans in the same area.

Me: People often mix up clothing that they think are the same. Besides clearance doesn't get discounts unless there's an event going on that specifically says so

At this moment one of my managers (who I'll call M) comes by and notices that I am struggling to get through to this guy.

M: Hey OP, what's wrong?

Me: CB was wondering if clearance had discounts.

M: I'm sorry sir but clearance doesn't get discounts.

CB: But I found it in an area with 40% discount.

M: Customers mix items up all the time. We only give discounts to clearance items during certain events. Let me show you with the price checker.

The manager grabs the pair of jeans and uses the price checker. To no ones surprise, the price was the full clearance price. The man seemed a bit baffled and walked away. I also went back to work but a little frustrated that it took two people saying the same thing for him to understand. I guess he actually didn't understand because roughly ten minutes later, that same guy approached me while I'm by a wall full of jeans. 

CB: See look, it says 40% off.

Me: Yes, but those are for regular priced jeans, not clearance jeans.

CB: But i found it here, it has to be 40% off.

Me: No sir, like I said before, someone probably mixed in some clearance jeans with the normal priced jeans.

CB: But these are skinny jeans and those are skinny jeans so clearly they should have the same discount?

Fed up with this guy, I call in a manager to help with the situation. Lucky for me, the same manager comes to talk to the CB. I stood back excited to see him get denied for a fourth time

M: I'm sorry sir but those clearance jeans don't have any discounts. 

CB: But I found them here and it clearly says 40% off.

M: We already used the price checker to prove that there are no discounts.

CB: But I used it on different items and it made the item cheaper.

M (starting to get annoyed): Congratulations but that doesn't affect the fact that items in clearance don't have any discounts.

We both walk away and I noticed the man was still standing there after the conversation for a while. He probably stood there for 10 to 15 minutes before leaving the store. I head to the back of the store and start fuming to my coworkers. I mean seriously, it's already cheaper than the original price, why try and make it lower?",TalesFromRetail,640,1558956137
WhyteWolf1992,"So you were charged 78 cents and you say it should have been 75 cents? You do realize you’re complaining about 3 cents, right?","So this is my first post to reddit and even though English is my first language and I write non fiction in my free time, typos and mistakes happen so give me a shout if you find something I missed!

So, I used to work in retail for just shy of nine years. In that time span, I worked the front check out as a cashier, an attendant at the self check outs, the courtesy bar where customers can process returns/exchanges or buy cigarettes, the floral counter, and occasionally the apparel desk. Yes, we were a big store that did everything, but didn’t really do it all that great sometimes. Jack of all trades and a master of none, as some would say. 

So anyways, this story, as most do, takes place at the courtesy desk. As I mentioned, we sell cigarettes here, rent out carpet cleaners, issue rain checks, process returns and exchanges, and handle price discrepancies, all while being expected to answer the phone in a timely manner (don’t you DARE let that phone ring more than three times!)

On this particular day, my store had corn cobs on sale for a multi buy special. You know, the kind of sale that’s usually something like 2 for $5 or $2.99 each. Well, my store tended to do things a little differently and the customers loved it. For us, instead of that single item being $2.99, you could buy one and still get it for $2.50, they just advertised it at 2/$5, because, you know, “business”. So for our store signs, multi buy prices would always list the individual price in a smaller (but in NO WAY illegibly small) font below the multi buy price. Always. This meant that, for the odd occasion when the individual price would be higher and a customer tried to dispute it, we could point it out and say it’s a multi buy, and that would be it. But not today …

So onto the story. The sale for corn was 8/$1. I know, it’s a steal! But for some of you clever readers, you might have already noticed that $1 divided by 8 is 12.5 cents and no store in their right mind will list something for a half cent so the sign read 8/1$ or $0.13each. No big deal, right? Wrong. Not for this lady. 

P.S. This was years ago, so the dialogue isn’t verbatim but it’s to the best of my memory. 

So I’m standing alone in courtesy, as we call it, and an older lady, late fifties at best, walks in with a receipt. I greet her as per normal and she seems very pleasant, a nice reprise from most of the older people that came into this store. I swear, most of them just wanted to give us a hard time. So anyways, I ask her how I can help her and she puts her receipt down on the counter and says, “I just bought some corn and was over charged.”
She points out the corn on her bill and it also shows there that the price 8/1$ or $0.13each.
So I nod and ask, “Oh, what was the price supposed to be?”
“It was supposed to be eight for a dollar,” she says. “I only bought six so I should have been charged 75 cents and I was charged 78.”
I pause for a moment and take in the fact that this woman is squabbling over 3 cents. I do my best to hide my reaction before I work some quick math in my head to find that six times the individual price of 13 cents would, in fact, be 78 cents. I then say to the woman, “Actually, Miss, the price is right.”
Before I can even explain myself, she interjects and says, “No, i was doing the math when I picked them out and they should be 12.5 cents each. In that case, they would be 75 cents. After all, I was two short of the full eight and two times 12.5 is 25. 25 cents off the dollar means 75 cents.”
I had hold my breath as she went around explaining this to me in so many roundabout ways. At this point, I was thankful for my years of experience in keeping my retail composure. Smiling to her, I politely explained, “Yes, I understand, Miss, but this sale is part of a multi buy and you need to buy all eight for the multi buy price to apply.”
“But this store always has the individual price the same as it would be if you were to buy the whole amount,” she argues.
She wasn’t wrong. At the point in time, our store never did the elevated individual pricing. That change wouldn’t come about for some time. But still, no store would list a price in fractions. “I understand, but it says right here on your receipt that the individual price is 13 cents each, which is only because we can’t actually list something for 12.5 cents. So, if you were to buy the full eight, the register would adjust for the proper pricing. I know, it’s a little weird, considering how our store pricing normally works, but it’s only because they couldn’t evenly divide the one dollar by eight. I am sorry, but the price you paid is right.”
She looks at me, still remaining calm, but not at all convinced. She’s made her point and I’ve made mine, but she’s not happy. She WANTS those three cents.
I can see that she’s about to argue further and, at this point, we’ve already discussed this for easily five minutes. There’s no one behind her in line, but I’ve had enough of this conversation and I absolutely refused to call my manager over 3 cents. It would be beyond a waste of time since I’ve had managers bend to the customers for way more. At this point, I take a soft breath and say, “Miss, I can refund you the three cents, but the price is right.”
At this point, she smiles and says, “Yes, I think I’d like that.”
As soon as she says that, she looks down to her receipt again and I’m so thankful because I could not stop myself from mouthing “wow” in an elongated manner and she was oblivious to it. I took her receipt in my hand and this is when this whole situation just got better. At our store, our return policy, as is the case with most stores, is that the refund must be applied in the same way it was paid. Meaning, that if she paid on a credit card, I had to refund it to her credit card. And boy did she use her credit card. So I key in a corn cob for a refund, altering the price to 3 whole cents, and look to her as I say, “Okay, the refund will go back on your credit card since that’s the way you originally paid for it.”
She hesitates a moment and I can only guess she’s about to ask me why I don’t just give her the cash. Surprisingly she doesn’t say anything and just fishes for her credit card. 
You’re lucky, lady, because I was NOT giving you cash. For those of you who don’t know, Canada has removed the pennies from circulation which meant I would have had to give her a 5 cent nickle and, with minimum wage currently at $14 at the time, she already wasted over $1.17 of my time and I wasn’t about to give her one penny more.",TalesFromRetail,1371,1558821696

I just started working part time as a cashier at a grocery store thst sells mostly produce , deli and butcher products, and thst sort of thing. I went theough training shifts and this was my first day working by myself. I had a sheet of common PLU codes (produce codes) and I've memorized several already. I felt like I was doing well. Not the fastest since I kept hsving to check codes, but not making any major mistakes.  
  
I got a guy who was buying something that I had to manually enter the barcode number for. It takes a second to read thst long string of numbers, but his order got done and he was on his way. I greet the woman who's next in line and do the whole bit while I start scanning in her stuff. Her response?  
  
 Dear, can you see?""  
  
I try to play it off like ""haha, my vision isn't the best but I manage!"" as I can feel the blood drain from my face and keep ringing her up.  
  
You looked like you were really straining.""  
  
I'm legally blind. You can't tell by looking at me, I just have prescription readers on I finish her order and she leaves. I start ringing up the next person and I'm just trying not to cry. I felt like I was doing so well on my own and managing everything fine. Then this woman points this out and I just feel awful. No matter how hard I try or how well I feel like I'm doing I'll never be able to operate normally. My disability is always there and nothing can change that. And people can tell something is wrong with me.  
  
I'm about to graduate from university with a CS degree as an A student. But this one woman's comment nesrly brought me to tears in the middle of a grocery store. And I cried about it when I got home. I don't even want to go back to work tomorrow after this.  
  
I know this will probably be buried, and it was probably a pretty depressing read for anyone who did. But it makes me feel a little better writing it out. Not much, but a little.

MGThanatos,Store thief involuntarily more than makes up his theft,"This is my first post on here and it's a story that happened to my mother who works as a regional sales manager at a discounter.
I'm on mobile and English is my 2nd language.

So this happened a couple weeks ago I think.
One worker, who was re-stocking, saw a dude take a cheese (yes, a cheese) and put it in his jacket. As the store employees have little headsets for better cross-store communication, he gave that information to the cashier.

The dude of course just tried to rush through and was stopped by the cashier, asking if they could come to the back because he was suspected of shoplifting.

The thief then tried to book it, ran into the first sliding door which opened too slow, almost ripped it out of the frame, ran into the second one, then made it out. While running away and (probably) to his car, he fell and slammed on the ground so hard that even the cashier running after him felt the pain he must've gotten from that.
In the end, he gets away.
BUT! In the parking lot, there lays: The cheese. And 10€.

Police were called, they just took everything to protocol and even joked why they were called when they have 10€ and the cheese.

aerstes,No ma'am we're not gonna move the farmers market closer to your house so you can save 25 cents,"So I work for a farm. The owner is also the manager of the farmers market association in town. We do 3 markets a week, one at a local park, one on a roadside property owned by the farm, and the third one just recently was moved back into the downtown area where there's a lot of foot traffic. This is obviously great for all the vendors and we're all really excited that the city is making room for us, which has been really difficult to achieve in the past. 

But obviously there are customers who will be crabby no matter what, right?

So two weeks ago, we had the opening market at the downtown site. Things get busy and i'm trying to wait on people as fast as I can while still being friendly and chatty because everyone is curious. I look to see who the next customer is and recognize this older lady (OL) who used to come to the market frequently but who I hadn't seen in awhile. She was the kind who didn't really ever buy much but always wanted to suck up your time with conversation. 

I greeted her, chatted to her a little, then she got a very serious expression and said ""now if you'll excuse me I need to yell at your boss""

Oookay then. I took the next customer but kept my ear on her obviously. When my boss is done with the person he's waiting on, she gets his attention.

OL: I'm mad at you. 

Boss: uh why?

OL: because this market used to be closer to my house and now it's not!

Honestly my boss and I both chuckled at this becuase we thought she was at least half kidding. 

Boss: (still thinking she's kidding around) well everyone else is happy we moved locations. 

OL: (getting more irate) well im not! I had to pay a quarter for parking! You need to move the market back. 

Boss: we didn't get any business there. We were losing vendors because of it. 

OL: I don't CARE. It was more CONVENIENT for ME! Move it back! 

Boss: ...No.

She stormed off shortly after. The kicker is when I got back to my car at the end of market I had to pay a whopping $7 total in meter fees but you didn't here me complaining or demanding a location change because of it!",TalesFromRetail,2294,1558645547
BlueWindMcfly,Lady tries to return something without the receipt... Or the product.,"This sub reminded me of one of my favourite retail stories from days of yore.

I worked a holiday season at a store that sold calendars, and very little else. Things were pretty straightforward and simple most of the time... Until *she* came in.

She came up to the register, and told me that the calendar she had sent her mother on the other side of the country had two Aprils, and no May. 

Me: Our apologies, that is a manufacturer defect that happens sometimes. I can exchange it for another one, or give your a refund. Do you have your receipt?  
Crazy Woman (CW): No.  
Me: No problem, I can still exchange it.  
CW: Well, I sent the calendar to my mother in \*city on the other side of the country\*  
Me: No problem, she can just take it back to a \*calendar store\* in her city, let them know the situation, and they can exchange it for her.  
CW: No, I want a refund for the defective calendar you sold me.  
Me: Unfortunately, without the receipt or the calendar, I can't give you a refund. Now, like I said, if your mother can take it to a store in her city...  
CW: NO! I will not ask her to do that! It was a gift! You will refund my money! 

She proceeds to take her bank statement out and angrily points at the transaction.

Me: I'm very sorry ma'am, but I can't do a refund based on your bank statement.

She continues to yell and scream and make a scene for a good 5-10 minutes, and though I don't remember the details, it was mostly about the age old adage ""the customer is always right, and you will give me my refund!"". Meanwhile a line starts to form behind her at our only till. My manager was on her break when this started, but came to help me as soon as she came back. She told the woman the same thing, and asked her to leave.

Crazy Woman finally leaves, but proceeds to yell at the people in line behind her on her way out ""they sell defective calendars! Don't buy from them!""

Still boggles my mind a decade later.",TalesFromRetail,1605,1558583065
Lokesenna,Lady cries because we “hurt her feelings”,"The other day this woman comes into the shop I work at with her 3 teenaged daughters, I work at a used clothing store. It’s consignment and our prices actually beat out most thrift stores, and about 1/3 of our stuff still has the tags on it. She’s just rude from the get go, demanding up front without so much as a please. She’s got armfuls of clothes she wants to try on. We have limit of 6 items per dressing room to keep count and help detour shoplifting. Our store is also small so unfortunately we only have 4 fitting rooms.

We let her into a room and she literally takes 15-20 minutes per 6 items she brings in to try on. We timed it. By now a line is forming outside the rooms because technically 3 are in use and it’s a busy Saturday. My boss has a policy that if a line is forming we have to start letting the others try their stuff on too and tell the hogs to get in line, all very nicely of course. Well this woman started arguing with our poor fitting room attendant whom is just 16. My boss steps in and tells her the policy, nicely. The lady storms out of the room.

Later she comes up to the counter with probably two 13 gallon trash bags worth of clothes. We start ringing her up, it comes to about $190. She moans and drones on about how expensive it is the entire time we’re ringing her up. She’s looking for a discount. My boss won’t budge, neither would I to give her one. Her teen daughters are looking quite embarrassed to boot, seems like this is a regular thing. 

She pays and leaves. 

Then several minutes later she comes back in the store crying and pointing her finger in my boss’s face.

“I don’t like how I’ve been treated here! You were so rude to me! You hurt my feelings!” She claimed. She’s nearly 60 years old too.

My boss asked her what she could do to make it better, (she just wanted it over with already).

The lady suddenly stops crying “Well you can start off with apologizing to me!”

My boss told her she was sorry that she had to follow store policy because other customers matter too.

Then the woman replies “I was kinda being a f***er” then asked for a hug then left.",TalesFromRetail,806,1558539866

M: um okay. (Walks the 5 feet over to the wall with her)

C: standing there staring at the spray paint, she then sighs very loudly

M: *quiet for a moment* uhm so do you need help finding anything else today?

Me: oh yeah? How did you like it?

C: I used it to spray paint a 400$ vase of mine and it ruined it l, I’ll have you know.

C: the spray paint fucked it up! The spray paint I bought from your store!!!

C: well can’t you just use this one off of the shelf? Like you already know what happened to it. You know it’s this one.

M: I need the physical product in the store in resell-able condition with a receipt to do a return. Also from what it sounds like, you’ve already used the product.

C: UGH fine. Just give me the refund for the vase then.

M: did you buy the vase from one of our stores?

C: no?

OW: Do you have cashmere sweaters in pink?
ME: We might in the future but currently only carry them in a few colors at this time. (We would add new colors of items all the time)

MotherEST2017,Literally not my problem,"I work in an expensive store in a affluent town. Last week I had a man come in and purchase three ceramic ornaments. He told me he was going to take them on a plane with him. I advised him that we can organise shipping for him but he was adamant that he wanted to take them with him today. 

I packed them up as well as I could, all individually wrapped in bubble wrap, plastic air bags in any spaces/gaps and then wrapped all three together in heavy duty bubble wrap and then another layer of heavy duty bubble wrap on top. 

Today I received a phone call from the same man, his ornaments are broken. The airline made him sign a disclaimer about flying with fragile items but according to this man I need to replace them in good faith. I explained that once the items have left our store, unless they are faulty we have no responsibility for them. He continued on at me about how I should replace them as they were broken and he had spent a lot of money. The conversation went around and around.  

I eventually told him I would pass on his concerns to the store owner in which he replied that they would probably fob him off. 

I honestly don't understand why he thinks my store should replace them as we didn't ship them, I offered our freight services and even the air line told him not to do it. Good lord I need a drink",TalesFromRetail,1389,1558408431
sufferingretail,“This is discrimination”,"About 6 months ago I had a customer approach me as I was tidying a clothing rack and ask where our petite clothing section was. I walked her over and explained that while the section itself is small, we do many items in a petite style that can be ordered for free next day delivery, or we can check another, larger store and if they stock it, call and reserve it for 24 hours for her. She smiled and thanks me, seems great right? I thought so too and went back to the rack I was at previously.

Around 15 minutes later she found me again at a different part of the store. Conversation went as follows:

BC - Bitchy Customer

NC - Nice Coworker

Me - ...

BC: Um, excuse me?

Me: What can I do for you?

BC: Why is there hardly any petite clothing?

Me: As I said before Ma’am, the section is small in store as we don’t sell a lot of it and so can’t justify the space on the shop floor being given to something that doesn’t make us a great deal of money, however we can order you any item of petite clothing for free next day delivery in store or next day home delivery for a small fee. I’m happy to look through the website with you and process any orders or check a local store for the stock for you?

BC: *clearly gearing up to something* This is unacceptable! Why wouldn’t you stock something aimed at shorter women! Look around the store, who in here is tall enough for regular clothing? THIS IS DISCRIMINATION!

I started to flounder at this as she was growing increasingly louder and continuously bringing up that it was discrimination, despite me explaining we could have it for her in store, next day, for free.

NC: What seems to be the problem here?

BC: THIS GIRL (I’m 21) IS BEING RUDE AND DISCRIMINATORY TOWARDS ME BECAUSE I NEED PETITE CLOTHING! (I’m 5’5, not exactly tall myself)

At this point I faded out of the conversation and slowly backed away, not really knowing how to handle the situation so leaving it for my coworker who has 25+ years of experience.

Turns out the lady filed a formal complaint about me and the coworker, but we just had a good laugh about it and frequently throughout the store now all shout “This is discrimination” at one another when something doesn’t go our way.

I work in a retail department store. Our policy for shoplifters is like most other retail stores, regular associates can’t use physical contact to stop a shoplifter, only the LP can. Associates are encouraged to “customer service” the suspect. This entails following them around undercover while “organizing” the products around their location. 

Today my manager took me off register to “customer service” a woman with a cart full of stuff. She caught our attention due to her sketchy behavior, including refusal to make eye contact. She had shoes, clothing, bags, beauty items, all stuffed into her cart. When she noticed that I was there I used it as an opportunity to plug our in-store credit card due to her mass amount of merchandise. 

I took her to my register and she got a “phone call” and started yelling into her phone about missing her wallet. I then offered to hold her items until tomorrow. She hightailed out of the store, and left her cart full of merchandise.

My manager and I started going through this cart. She had taken a ton of clothes off the hangers. We were pulling beauty items out of empty shoe boxes, clothes and jewelry out of purses. It was crazy seeing the mass amount of merchandise she had stuffed into empty bags ready to run out with. We decided to ring up the merchandise as we were organizing it just to see how much it was worth and we got to $940. 

After checking the security cameras we found out she got out with a pair of shoes and a phone charger. She left her old shoes in the shopping cart, too.",TalesFromRetail,2125,1558315971
MajorAlBowie,Refund my worn out underwear or I'll SUE you!,"Texting from my phone so my apologies for any mistakes.

A few years ago I was the manager at a store for a company that specialized in As Seen On TV products.  As you can imagine it was a pretty fun job.  I was allowed, even encouraged to try out all the products so we could promote them better.  The down side however was some of the...interesting customers that wanted refunds for the wierdest things.

One rather slow day, I had just finished restocking the shelves when a customer came storming into the store.  The look on his face was comparable to the grumpy cat...if it was human.

Me=Me
GM=Grumpy Cat Man

Me: Anything I can give you a hand with sir?

GM: These are defective!  I want a refund!

He put a plastic bag bag down on the desk and took out a very ratty looking pair of Tommy Copper boxer briefs.

-For a bit of context, the company return policy was basically exchange or store credit with a few refund exceptions based on manufacturers guarantees.  Any clothing items, were strictly final sale due to hygenic reasons, but we would occasionally allow exchanges for defects within a certain time period.  The policy was always printed out on the reciept, and we had an official 8×10 copy from head office with the heading ""RETURN POLICY"" set up in plain sight next to the register.-

Me: Can I see your receipt? 

He handed it to me,  still scowling.  I looked at the purchase date and saw that the purchase had been a bit over 5 months ago. It was also stamped ""FINAL SALE"" In red ink.

Me: Sorry Boss, but it looks like this was purchased over 5 months ago.  Not only that, this item is Final Sale, as it says right here..*grabbing a highlighter and tracing it over the bold ""FINAL SALE"" stamp.

GM:  No!  Thats bulls**t!  This is YOUR product, so its YOUR responsibility!

Me: I'm afraid not boss.  Unfortunately we're not the manufacturer, just the retailer.  And I'm afraid this isn't a defect.  It's wear and tear.

GM: Get me your manager!

Me: *Pointing to the nametag on my lanyard* I AM the manager sir, and I'm sorry but that's our company policy.

GM:  Bulls**t!!!  I could sue you for this! If there was such a policy, it legally has to be in writing for customers to see!

Me: *losing my patience*  It IS...SIR!  Here... *Highlighting it on his receipt* ...and HERE *pointing to the aformentioned sign in front of him.*

I watched his face get red as he looked from his receipt to the sign and back. 

GM: Well...*glaring at me* You'll be hearing from my lawyer!""

He grabbed up his item and receipt, turned on his heel and stormed out.

Me: Ok!  Take care now!  Have a great day!😁

MuchStandard,You want to complain because of what????,"So I used to work at a UK convenience store as a supervisor and was working at the checkout. 
These two girls come with a pack of beer at my till and as I took the beers from their hands to scan them they hit a corner of the till and on of the beer just popped open and spilled everywhere: on the till, the girls in front of me and myself.
I extensively apologized to the girls, gave them tissues to dry themselves, etc... They weren’t mad as it was clearly an accident. 
Nevertheless the guy behind them proceeded to go to my coworker saying that he wanted to make a complaint. My colleagues points to me as I am in charge. (C for customer, Me for me)

C: I want to make a complaint 
Me: what happened?
C: the beer spilled all over me 

The guy was a solid 2m behind the girls, I mean he probably got a little bit on him but come on 

Me: I’m sorry about that, it was an accident
C: I don’t care, I want to make a complaint
Me (getting slightly frustrated): Well, it spilled over me too
C: It doesn’t matter, you’re working 
Me (at this point I’m over it so I just grab a customer service card and gives it to him): whatever makes your life less miserable.

He just groaned and left.

brightspee,"the good ol' buy, wash, &amp; return","I work at a bra/underwear/lingerie store, but not the big one you're thinking about. Recently, we've been noticing some regular customers coming in, and this one lady, who my coworkers have unfortunately labeled ""the crackhead"" has really stood out to us. This woman is short, skinny and blonde, and dresses like a 15-year-old girl, when she's probably in her 30s. She always has a snapback and a backpack on, and whenever she's shopping she is overwhelming loud, giggly, jittery, and shops extremely fast. The first time she made a purchase she was in the fitting room for almost an hour, basically trying on every pushup bra and pieces of lingerie we had in the store. She made an absolute mess of the fitting room, but at least she ended up finding a bra and panty set she wanted to buy. As I was ringing her up I asked her if she was getting this for a specific occasion (as I do with most customers), or if it was just for fun. She goes on to talk for 10 minutes about her photoshoots, modeling, and her instagram. About an hour later, my coworker is cleaning out the fitting rooms, and runs out shrieking, holding a pile of panties away from her. This customer tried on all of our panties and lingerie WITHOUT leaving her own panties on. Everything was pungent and needless to say, it all went into the damage bin. We were all pretty upset about it, but we tried to remind ourselves that she is a top customer and always spends over $200 every time she comes -- we'll just remind her the next time she goes to try things on.

Another time she comes in, we have an assistant manager training with our team. This customer wants to make a return. When she takes out the bras and panties she wants to return, our store's manager examines the products and concludes that they have been washed and that she can't accept or process the return. I'm sure most of you would be able to tell, as it was pretty obvious, AND the bras smelt like detergent. Listen, if I can figure out which brand of detergent you're using (my take = Downy) then you've clearly washed them. Obviously this woman denied it, getting really defensive and claiming that she ""would have to be crazy to wash and then try to the return"" the stuff. Our store's manager reiterated it again that she can't return it, and went into the back. The assistant manager training with us, from another store, processed the return after our manager went to the back, probably because she hates confrontation. Regardless, my coworkers and I were confused and upset, and once our manager came back, she was FURIOUS. She went behind our backs and violated the policy that is very clear on the receipt, and now she's gone and let her get away with it.

&amp;#x200B;

She has come in a few more times since, and tried to return washed items several times. One of those times, the same training manager processed the return AGAIN, and added this customer on instagram. Finally, in a pretty intense encounter, our store manager confronted the woman the last time she tried to give us worn and washed items and refused the return. We haven't seen her since.",TalesFromRetail,1060,1558109079
Mimsay,Customer tracks me down after 4 years to scold me for not following company policy,"I worked in sales at a large cemetery for several years until about 6 months ago. In early 2015, I sold a cemetery plot to a lady who's estranged mother had died. They had not spoken for 20 years. After the funeral, it was my job to sell her a headstone and try to persuade her to purchase additional cemetery plots for herself and other family members. She was a nightmare to work with. 15 minute appointments lasted hours because she talked non-stop and she expected someone to be available to assist her 24/7.  She called me at home at 10pm one evening to ask how to spell a word for her mother's headstone. I sold her 2 cemetery plots for herself and her high school aged son, and she also reserved 2 additional plots in case her son married and had kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

When she reserved the plots, I told her our company policy was to only the hold the plots for 30 days, but that I left the reservations in the books indefinitely. I told her that I would not offer them for sale to anyone else, but, if someone else asked to buy them, I would have to sell them to that person. I told her that if I ever left the company, I could not guarantee that the company would leave them on hold indefinitely, and that the only way to guarantee the plots would remain unused was for her to purchase them. We had easy payment plans with no interest, and you could sell them if you later changed your mind. I know I told her this, because I told every customer the same thing for 5+ years. I could've repeated the spiel in my sleep. We also gave written price quotes. At the bottom of each quote sheet it said, ""Prices and plot reservations are valid for 30 days."" I liked to keep the reservations in the books and use them as a sales tool. Every once and a while, I would find the years-old reservations and call the families and ask if they were still interested in the plots because I had another family looking at them. My company knew I did this, and approved of it so much they told other sales people to try it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, almost 4 and a half years later, she calls my cell phone at 9:30pm and said the sales lady that took my place called her out of the blue and asked if she was still interested in the plots. The sales lady told her ""If you want the plots, you need to purchase them now, otherwise we cannot continue to hold them for you indefinitely."" (My sales pitch, still in action!)  She told me this was very upsetting as I had given her a contract that stated they were on hold indefinitely and she wanted to know what she could do. I said, ""You don't have a contract that says that. If you remember, I told you blah blah blah the whole spiel again (which I still have memorized), and that on the bottom of the price sheet, it says they are only good for 30 days. She said, ""Well it was such an emotional time, I didn't read the 'fine print.' I only went by what you said."" I reminded her that I said the exact same thing, just with more detail. I reminded her that I sent a letter to her and every other customer that I'd told that to that I would be leaving the company and that I couldn't guarantee the plots would remain on hold, since I wouldn't be in charge of that anymore. Honestly, that was a last-ditch sales pitch so I could go out with a bang. But, I did really care for a lot of my customers so I didn't want them to be surprised. This did not sit well with her because she just started shrieking about how I lied to her and now she was devastated that she had to buy the plots now or lose them forever and she didn't have the money for the down payment. I told her I'm sorry she was unhappy with the cemetery but since I don't work there anymore, I can't help her with anything cemetery related and please don't call me again. She hung up and texted me all night about how mean I was until I finally just blocked her number. 

&amp;#x200B;

The down payment for the plots was less than $100. Her mother left her well over a million dollars. Wonder where all that money went?",TalesFromRetail,1923,1558035820
kurisu313,You can't pick up something we don't have!,"I work for a corner shop in England.  It's part of a chain but it's a small store so we only ever have one employee on at a time.  One day, the phone rings and the conversation starts.  AM for Angry Man.

Me:  Hi, this is [shop], Kurisu speaking.

AM:  Uh, hi.  I was there this morning and I left my keys behind.  

Me:  When was that?

AM:  About 4 hours ago.  I'll be down tomorrow to pick them up.

Me:  Ah, that's when my co-worker was on.  I'll just see if she put them in the box.

I take a look in our little lost and found box which is just underneath the counter.  There's a couple of keys in there that have been there for a while that were never picked up.  I was familiar with them.  A quick rummage doesn't show any new keys in there.

Me:  Well, I'm looking at the counter right now and-

felines_and_reptiles,Lady Calls the Police Because She “No Longer Likes her Photos”,"So some background. I used a work at a fairly popular photo studio that used to be inside a large box store (but wasn't actually owned by the box store) before they went out of business.

The studio rarely offered Full Time work outside of managers but if you were willing to be a ""Bouncer"" then you could pick up more hours by bouncing between studios. I was a Bouncer. This sometimes meant driving nearly 2 hours, passing four other Big Box Stores before finally arriving at the one that I was working a particular day.

Another thing I should add is that photo collections could run anywhere from $7.99 to $399.99 depending on how many prints you got or if you fancied yourself a canvas piece. The higher priced collections (anything above $159.99) would buy you the copyrights to your own photos as well as the digital files on CD. Having the copyright allowed you to take your photos anywhere you liked to have more prints made.

We all still here? Awesome.

I was working in a studio about 40 miles from where I lived and it was the fourth time I had ever worked at this particular studio. I already LOATHED this studio. I had already dealt with a mom who chastised her deaf daughter for not smiling when I asked her to (another story for another day) and a mom and adult daughter who had come in for maternity style pictures but then became pissed when I asked when the baby was due because no one was actually pregnant (Yeah, I'm still trying to pick my jaw up off the floor and its been years)

But this day? This day the craziest of them all would make the other two sessions look like nothing.

In comes a lady with who I assumed were her parents or just two random old people who followed her around and only spoke Spanish. She had come in to finish paying for her photos and pick them up. Now, this was about 7 or 8 years ago so I'm paraphrasing here.

Crazy Mom = CM and then Me is well, me.

CM: Hi there, I'd like to pick up my photos.

Me: Oh sure, your name?

She gives me her name and I flip through the drawer to find her photos. Its a thick envelope so I already know she got one of the more expensive packages.

Me: Here they are.

I open the envelope and carefully pull out the twenty or so prints of her little girl. Cute kid. Looks like she was an absolute ham for the camera. (someone else took these photos, not me)

Me: Aww, isn't she the cutest? How old is she?

CM: Oh my God, they turned out great. She's four. 

Me: I love that age. 

We all flip through the photos so that Mom can examine and approve. Her and the older man and woman with her are all cooing over them. 

Me: How do they look, Mom?

CM: They're perfect.

Me: I love to hear it. Now, it looks like we have a remaining balance of $200. I'll need to get that before we can release them.

CM: Right.

She pulls out her wallet and gives me the $200 in cash. I enter it into the computer, money goes in the till, we have a $0 balance, a happy mom, happy maybe grandparents. All is right in the world.

Something in the Ozone changes.

CM: (after looking through her pictures one more time, finding her CD of all of her pictures but still seems to be looking for something) Um, when I talked to the lady in the Photo Center, she said I needed a paper with that said I owned the copyright, where is that?

Me: A paper?

CM: Yeah, with the copyright?

Now, I had only worked with the company for about a month and honestly, no one had ever asked me this before and no one had ever told me about needing a copyright release form.

Me: Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know but I can ask.

I'm the only one in the studio so I have to call my manger. I ask her about the copyright and she lets me know that there's a .pdf file on the CD that contains the release. Great. Problem solved.

Me: My manager let me know that the release is actually on the CD so when you take the CD into the photo center, it'll be right there.

CM: Can't you just print it out?

Me: I'm sorry. I don't actually have a printer for that. (This location honestly didn't have one)

CM: Well, I don't believe you.

Me: I'm sorry?

CM: I don't believe you. I want the copyright.

Me: The copyright is on the CD, but unfortunately, I'm unable to print it without a printer. You can probably have it printed at the Photo Center when you have your extra prints printed.

The Crazy Mom is quiet for a moment and I think shes absorbing everything I've told her and everything will be okay again.

Wrong.

CM: I don't like these pictures. I want my money back.

Me: I'm sorry?

CM: I don't want these ugly pictures. Give me a refund.

She shoves the envelope of photos back at me and folds her arms.

Me: Ma'am, unfortunately we are unable to give refunds on photos.

CM: Yes you can, give me my money back.

Me: I really can't. All sales are final.

CM: Just open the register and give me my money. The money I just gave you?

Me: Once the money goes in, I'm unable to get it back out. Refunds can only be processed by Corporate

(This was actually true. I later became a manager and even then, I wasn't allowed to give refunds on photos. They never even taught me how to do it. I mean, honestly, what are we supposed to do? Sell your baby's pictures to someone else?)

CM: You can't give me the money I just gave you.

Me: No, Ma'am.

CM: I want to speak with your manager. Call her again. 

Me: Sure thing, Ma'am.

I call my manager back and explain the situation. Manager = M.

M: Didn't you have her look at the pictures first before she paid?

Me: Yeah, and she approved them. But she wants a refund now. Do you want to speak with her?

M: No, I don't. Just tell her to call corporate and we don't give refunds.

Me: Um, okay.

I hang up.

CM: Why didn't you let me talk to her?

I'm heated at this point because she's pretty much screaming at me and Big Box Store customers checking out are staring. I'm shaking with anger but I'm doing my best to continue my best customer service voice.

Me: Because she didn't want to speak with you. Ma'am, I'm sorry but we are unable to give refunds at the studio level. Only corporate can.

CM: If you don't give me my money, I'm calling the cops.

Me: You're welcome to do that, Ma'am but there's nothing else that I can do but give you your photos.

CM: I DON'T WANT THOSE. I - WANT - A - REFUND!!!

She slams her hands down on the counter and I step back, pretty sure this lady is going to hit me.

Me: I'm sorry, but there's nothing else that I can do.

CM: Fine, I'm calling the police and I'm suing you. I'll get you fired.

Honestly, why do they all say this? Why do they all think that they have the authority to get anyone fired? Oh no, a customer is unhappy, better fire the employee that they abused.

At this point, she walks away from the studio and into the store while apparently calling the police on her phone. I don't know if she was pretending to try and scare me or if dispatch just told her to stop being a lunatic because no cops ever came.

I take this opportunity to get some water and call my manager to let her know what was going on.

M: She's really calling the cops?

Me: I guess.

M: What's her problem again?

Me: She liked the pictured, paid the $200 she owed for them. Then asked about the release form, wanted me to print it. I told her we didn't have a printer.

M: That studio doesn't have one?

Me: No. We should probably get one after this. But after I told her we didn't have one, all of a sudden, she wanted a refund and said the pictures were ugly.

Manager kind of sighs. 

M: What a crazy \*\*\*\*\* Hey, while I have you on the phone. I wanted to ask you about entering our Manager in Training Program. The (Studio closest to where I live) Manager is quitting and I would like you to take her place. 

I'm startled.

Me: Oh, absolutely! I'd love that.

M: Great. Call me back if the psycho comes back or the cops come.

They never did. Lady never even took her pictures that she paid for.

TL:DR Lady calls the cops because I won't give her a refund, says she'll get me fired, may have gotten me promoted instead.",TalesFromRetail,2388,1557949511
Jakfan15,Sit on the potting mix and you will turn into a tree.,"I work at a grocery store where near our large registers we have a display with different types of potting mix. Quite often kids love to climb and sit on them while their parents are getting rung up, which I don’t mind. 
It was a few years ago when, once again, two kids were playing on the potting mix. There parents told them to get down, which like all small children do, ignored them. 
It was at this moment an idea came to me. I like to help the parents out as much as possible, knowing how much of a handful kids can be. 
I turned to the kids as I was still scanning and bagging and said, “You know, if you sit on the potting mix too long you will turn into a tree?”
The kids just looked at me, kinda shocked before jumping down and running up to their parents. One of them bravely said to me (most kids are too shy to talk back) and said to me, “That’s not true!”
I just replied, “Well, where do you think the trees outside come from?” 
The kid looked confused like it made sense but didn’t at the same time. Needless to say, the kids didn’t climb back on the potting mix and the parents got a good chuckle out of it.

Background: I’ve been working retail since I was 16. As soon as I could get a job my parents drove me to the mall dressed nicely and said “see you in a few hours” and that’s how I got my first job. Relevant because that’s where I was working at the time of this story. I was around 17 at the time. I worked at a small kitchen gadget store in a big outdoor but covered mall. Nice area. Not too big of a city, but off the highway so a lot of people come by. Now that you have an idea of the setting let’s dive in.

It was a rainy evening. Now, at this store it was common for one person to close alone as there is a drop off in customer traffic after like 8 as the mall closed around 9 on a normal week. It was around 8, I was leaving. My favorite coworker, an elderly woman that was as sweet as pie, was closing. I say goodbye and go on my way home. Normal night. Was gonna go get a lunchable and ice cream from the grocery store. Hey high school life. On my way out a strange man comes up to me and insists on walking me to my car. It’s raining and he has an umbrella. He had to be in his 40’s and he had a son my age with him. I asked him to leave me alone, he didn’t. So I made up some bs story that I left something behind and ran back into work. Told my coworker. I had security escort me to my car.

NautiBoppi,She really smelled bad.,"When I was in college I worked part time at a ""do it yourself"" floor covering store. This store was owned by a really great guy and it was staffed by him, his two sons, two other guys, and myself.  We sold carpeting, tile, vinyl floor covering, etc. I was originally hired as a stock boy and that was my primary function but when it got busy it was all hands on deck for sales. They had a policy that if I though I wasn't going to close the sale I was to turn it over to to one of the sons or the ""old man"" ( he actually was only in his 40's).

One busy day a lady comes in and I went up to help her. I was immediately hit with some of the worst B.O. I have ever experienced in my life. I mean it made my eyes water and I was actually getting dizzy from her strong pungent smell.

I excused myself claiming I thought we might have some items she was interested in that hadn't been place on the floor yet and went into the back storeroom to find some help.

I found the owner's oldest son who laughed at me and said he'd handle it. A few minutes later he came back into the storage area gasping for air. He turned it over to his younger brother and he didn't last any longer. Finally the old man says he'd handle it and proceeded to work with this lady for over an hour and a half. He sells her a ton of stuff. She owned several properties she was fixing up.

After he finishes the sale and she left we asked him how the hell he could stand the stench. His reply was ""boys, all I smelled was her money"".

 they walk around alot looking at everything and I keep watch. At one point G1 said ""she's watching me"". Then G1 gets some five cent candies worth 25 cents and asks for a plastic bag for her FIVE CANDIES. Red flag #1. 

I gave the bag cause most kids come on bikes and she seemed to have no pockets.
They keep walking around for a while and G1 kept rustling her bag behind aisles I couldn't see her clearly and looked at me a couple times behind a aisle of chips. Red flag #2.

Something's fishy. The aisle she was behind, across horizontally was a sink so I decided to bring a cup with me so I make it look like I'm rinsing my cup to get a better look to clear my suspicions.
 The. Fucking girl. She attempted to steal two LARGE chocolate bars, a mini cup of Pringles, some nerd candy boxes, and a Hershey's bar. I snagged her bag from her and yelled at both of them that they should know better and is this what their parents taught them, etc. 

I told em to get out and they ran out quickly.
I just can't believe how this girl thought she was sneaky and how she thought we could get away with stealing so much candy... especially at such a young age.


NOTE: I know y'all are gonna say ""why didn't you ask for their parents number and get them or call the cops""
I've never really dealt with such a situation before, and I was really angry so I guess rational thoughts were not present in the moment, lol.",TalesFromRetail,923,1557702597
Nigthsmile,Lady forces me to say the word “Panties”,"Working at a small retail clothe store it can get you a lot of characters for customer.

This one literally happened yesterday. After ringing up this old lady that had bought 2 bras, I start taking the receipt and say my usual cashier line. 

Just for context Me=Me and Panties lady= PL

Me:”If you want to exchange or return and item please do so with your original receipt. You’ll have 45 days to do so.”

Pl: “Can bras ve returned here?”

Me: “Well yes, the only item that cannot be return from intimates would be the bottom one”

Pl: “Panties”

Me: “Yes”

Pl: “No, No, I want you to say it. Panties”

Now im just confused because this old woman is starring at me trying to get me to say the word “Panties” as if I was 2 and never knew about female underwear. After just starring at her I proceed to answer with. 

“Yes, Panties”

And after that she just leaves after mocking me because apparently she made me blush. It shocked me still that by me trying to be well mannered and gentle I still get weird people like this pantie lady.",TalesFromRetail,1992,1557662855
angrymarie,The sweetest customer shutdown.," A lady called to say that the birthday cake she had bought from our store has bits of plastic in it. Furthermore,this cake had been shared with an entire class of young kids. Customer was soo afraid that her son would be deathly ill from the plastic that she had spent the whooole evening and night at the ER just in case. So of course she had to miss a day of work. So we needed to make all that right.
I knew something very important that she apparently didn't,but decided to string her along a bit.
I asked all the questions. What kind of cake? Are you sure it was this store? Frozen or bakery? She assured me that it was fresh from our bakery. So I told her she needed to talk to my store manager,because I wanted to share this golden moment.
 SM got the same story from the lady. Asked all the same questions,grinning at me the while.
Then he said to her that it was the very strangest thing,that this horrible thing had happened. He then let her in on that little piece of critical info that she was missing. 
 ""Do you remember that Hurricane we had seven months ago? Yeah,well it destroyed this store,our bakery,and all our frozen food cases,and those have yet to be restored.""

Writer4God,When shoplifters lose their minds...,"When I worked in a thrift store, theft was always a big issue and it was always hard to track even with a full staff.  We have our ""regulars"" and some of those regulars have been banned. This is one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I was doing my thing and stocking merchandise on the sales floor when I notice a regular thief making her rounds (we'll call her RT for short).  She smiles at me as she peruses the clothing section with an open backpack hanging from her shoulder.  We have a policy where backpacks are checked in at the cash wrap to prevent theft.  I ask RT if she minds checking her bag in and she obliges and goes back to looking at our stuff.  I then do some work related stuff of my own until I get flagged down by my assistant manager (AM).  AM pulls me aside and tells me that the backpack RT had on her shoulder belonged to us and the contents inside ALSO belonged to us.  I was also instructed to NOT give the backpack back to her should I end up cashing her out.  The store manager (SM) stations herself near the cash wrap along with AM (apparently, they were watching the security cameras) standing next to the cashier.

&amp;#x200B;

I was on fitting room duty as I watched the whole situation unfold; it was like watching a train wreck.  You can't look away but you can't help but stare. RT approaches the cash wrap with her items and asks for ""her"" backpack to be returned to her.  AM calmly and politely tells her no, that backpack belongs to the store and if she wants it, she can pay for it.  RT loses her marbles and starts screaming and cussing and pitching a massive tantrum, big enough to get the attention of the whole store, both employees and customers.  SM tells RT that she is no longer welcome and banned from the store (something my co-worker wanted to have done for a long time) and if she stayed and pitched a bigger hissyfit, the police would be called.  RT continued her tirade for about a minute or so and left empty handed.

ambassadorpenguin,"Paying cash doesn’t help your chances, lady.","I work in a cell phone store that closes at 8pm. When there is no customer in the store, the door is locked at 8 pm on the dot and displays have been already taken down 5 minutes prior, money precounted and waiting to be saved at closing.  

Wednesday a car pulls into a spot in front of our door at 8:01 pm. By that time, our displays are down and money has been counted and deposited because no one had been in the store for 4 hours. Closing got done early, all I needed was to lock the door and hit save on the deposit screen. Done and done!

Customer pulls on the locked door at 8:04 pm, after I have set the alarm and scanned my finger to clock out for the night. I yell from the back of the store that we are closed, and she yells back that she just needs to pay her bill. I tell her again that we are closed. She still pulls and yells. 

Well, now I’m going to show her that we are closed by going out of the door and locking it behind me. As I get to the door, she tries to shove her way in with her daughter. I tell her a third time that we closed at 8 pm and she would have to come back tomorrow. Cue the water works, the begging, the pleading. She **HAS** to pay her bill! Her phone will get cut off. Just please! It’s just a bill pay. Then she utters the words that ultimately shut down the thought of reopening for a bill pay...*”I’m just paying in cash!”* Yep, that doesn’t help your cause. 

After explaining to her that I was not going to turn off the alarm, clock back in, open a new cash drawer to take her payment which would result in me having to count and create a new deposit and reclose the drawer, she finally decided that calling me a bunch of names was the best route to take.

Instead of setting an example of no means no for your child, you show her that getting not getting your way means you throw a tantrum. Great job, mom!

A customer came up to pay for her items. (Customer = C, Me = Me)

C :  Do you take this loyalty card?

Me :  No, sorry.

C :  It's always so difficult to find out where you can use these!

As I myself have that same loyalty card, and I saw she fiddled with her smartphone while waiting in line, I offered up, what i considered, helpful advise.

Me :  They actually have a great app, which informs you which shops in your vicinity accepts said loyalty card. 

The customer just nodded. While she paid, she made a comment on something, I don't remember what, but apparently it was a joke...

C :  Aren't you going to laugh at my joke???

I didn't know it was a joke, until she said so, and it definitely were not funny. At a loss for words I just said:

Me : Sorry.... I.... have a weird sense of humour??

She didn't make more out of it and left. 

1 hour later my boss pulls me aside, and ask me if I had a ""bad"" customer earlier? 

Apparenly she called the store and asked to talk to the manager, after she got home.  She claimed I was rude and told her to look up herself where the loyalty card could be used. She also complained to my boss that I didn't laugh at her joke, and that not laughing equaled bad customer service.

My boss was understanding, and told me that these kinds of customers can't be pleased.

ERROR-404-life,"Customer refuses to donate to charity, demands I give up my pay for it","Hi! This is my first post, but when I found this subreddit I had a story that immediately came to mind, and I knew I just had to share it. Sorry for rambling.

For clarity, I live in a tiny rural town in Australia. Everyone knows each other and the local meth addict kind of town. It's completely feral and I have many a story for that some other time. 

I work in a popular dollar store in said small town. I have worked there for nearly a year now, but this store has been there since I was a kid. Every year, they have a charity week, where all the employees collect donations, which are then sent off to a bigger charity that the store has sponsored at the end of the week. It's quite fun, and I got to dress up (I had to wear a Rainbow Dash style wig, which all the kids loved).

I had a system to asking for donations, to avoid it being awkward. My feral aunt/boss doesn't seem to understand the concept that people who pay with card don't often have spare change on them to give, and had a go at me for the way I did things, but hey, we still raised nearly $850 in that one week, so I must've done alright. Anyways, anyone who paid with cash, or had a purse or wallet on them I would ask if they would like to donate, and explained to them the charity we were raising for (I can't remember the name, but it was for kids with heart diseases, which caused a lot of people to donate right off the bat). 

As I was working one day, rainbow wig and all, this young girl goes up to the counter, presumed mum following in tow, eyes on her phone. I'm fine with parent's being on their phones (I barely get off mine, so I can relate) but she just like did not look up, not even as she was turning corners or anything. I walk over behind the counter and scan all the girl's stuff. She was so excited, clearly having just gotten out of school, and had like a diary and some pens. The mum sets her phone down, screen still on messages, then grabs her purse and fishes through it and pulls out a $20. Because she's paying with cash, I ask ""would you like to donate to charity?"" She looked at me like I was fucking Nightcrawler. This was the following exchange:

C: what?

Me: we have a donation box set up, would you like to donate any loose change you have rattling around?

C: why?

Me, a bit dumfounded: because it's for children with heart conditions, to help them-

C, cutting me off: why would I give my hard earned cash to some random cashier?

Me: uh, it's fine, you don't have to donate, I just ask everyone-

C, giving me a hard glare: why don't YOU donate???

Me: I already have...? (we have the option to donate some of our pay to charity, it is just taken off the total when we sign. I gave like $50 with everyone else)

C: really?? how much? If you really cared, you would give all your savings. But you're just some dumb kid!

Thank god I had a regular who was waiting in line. She shoved her basket forward onto my counter, pushing the woman out of the way, silently giving her the biggest fuck you.

She just stormed off, and I put her $12 change in the donation box like I was instructed to do with everyone else. The people in line all just dumped their change from their pockets into the box.

I have so many other stories of crazy city people coming into this local shop and just fucking my whole day up, but this was probably one of the weirdest experiences.",TalesFromRetail,1984,1557228747

We recently had two people quit so my part time hours for the last couple weeks have been full time.

I was ringing her up, and she had too many items for our bag carousel so I had to put some off to the side. When she turned it to begin picking up her bags some fell over onto the ground. I go to pick them up, but that's not enough for her. She demands that I give them to her for free, which I can't, because I dropped paper towel and napkins. I explain I can't, since nothing broke, and she goes  off on tangent about how I was rude, threw her stuff on the ground, and this is why I'm clerking in a store and don't have a real job.

I look around and see no one else around besides my regular, so I lean in real close and go ""hey lady, youre a bit of a bitch. Just so you know.""

AngelWithAnArrow,Old lady cusses me out and gets instant karma.,"&amp;#x200B;

I work in a very small store in a very small community, and have worked there for over a year now.

This particular store is surrounded in very small houses, usually occupied by the elderly and middle aged single mothers with their multiple kids, and the younger customers are all usually on financial aid of some kind.

Now I LOVE my job on most days, usually everyone is friendly and I have a hilarious and lovely group of regulars that I love to speak with. However, this time I had a night of almost no sleep, and had to serve all of the usual jobless alcoholics and junkies in the area that morning, so I was a force to be reckoned with on this morning. 

I tried my best to be upbeat and friendly with everyone, because my mood had nothing to do with them whatsoever and they didn't deserve to see it. 

UNTIL- 

Agnes walks in. She is an elderly lady who comes in every second day, almost never speaks to the employee's and is usually not an issue for us- but this morning she was an absolute nightmare for absolutely no reason.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of necessary detail for all of you- my store has a checkout policy, where you only need to call for someone else to jump onto another register and serve customers- IF  there are more than 3 customers waiting, otherwise one is enough, and I have over 4 years of retail experience (I'm 21) so I am LIGHTNING fast on the register and can serve those three people within a minute.

&amp;#x200B;

I am serving one man in front of me, another man is behind him- and Agnes is behind the second man. When Agnes joins the line of customers- I am just finishing serving the first man, and moving on to the second when I hear her complain to another customer.

Agnes: ""They're supposed to ring for someone else (another employee)"" She says in a very grumpy voice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't hear what the other customer says, but he doesn't sound at all bothered. I ignore her and continue to serve the man in front of me, while I hear her continue to complain about me in the background.

I finish serving my customer and Agnes walks up to me with her basket of items, I smile and say 'Good morning' and begin scanning her items.

She leans forward on the counter and glares daggers at me.

""***You are supposed to call for someone else when there's people in the line!""*** She growls at me slowly as if scolding a child.

I feel my heart begin to race, but I try my best to keep calm. I have an anxiety disorder, and do not cope well with confrontation, especially when I have done nothing wrong, so I tend to get upset very easily. 

I explain the policy to her as politely as I could, that I do not have to 'call' for another employee unless there are more than three people waiting. When she joined the line there were only 2.

Agnes: ""I DON'T CARE, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CALL!""

Me: \*Beginning to shake\* ""I just served you within 15 seconds of you joining the line-""

Agnes: ""You all think you're f\*cking clever in here, don't you?"" She grumbles as she pulls out her purse to pay for her items.

My eyes widen to the size of dinner plates and I feel my heart beat faster, I feel the anger rising. ""...*E-Excuse me*?"" I ask, and she shakes her head as if she didn't even hear me.

""Stupid b\*tch"" She grumbles as she places her card in the card-reader.

&amp;#x200B;

That was it. That crossed the line for me. 

I press the button on my screen to 'Cancel the transaction', and she briefly freezes as the machine refuses her card. She looks up at me in anger, and gives me a face that says 'What?""

Me: ""I'm not going to serve you if you're going to speak to me that way."" I sound quite firm, but on the inside I am *angry* and NOT in the mood to deal with the disrespect.

She just scoffs, pushes her basket of items towards me, which I take, and continues to cuss me out.

""YOU ALL THINK YOU'RE F\*CKING CLEVER IN THIS SHOP"" She yells at me, and I (somehow) manage to contain the tears, ""FINE TAKE THIS STUFF! STUPID F\*CKING BITCH-"" She continues as she storms out of the shop.

&amp;#x200B;

I turn to face the new line of customers that has formed during this confrontation, and I notice that everybody is looking at me in sympathy. I take a deep breath to try and steady my (now racing) heart rate and say to the man in front of me,

""You can't demand a service while simulaniously insulting those providing it for you"" and take another breath before I begin to serve him.

That's when I notice. 

***Agnes had left her bank card in the card-reader.***

&amp;#x200B;

I let out a short laugh and say ''Karma'' before placing it on the counter behind me, making the customers laugh too. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few customers in the line gave me a thumbs-up, letting me know I was not in the wrong and that I did the right thing, but I was still extremely shaken up. My anxiety does not allow me steady emotions at this moment in time, and I did end up calling for my coworker to take over my register while I disappeared into the back of the store for a quick cry and a panic attack.

My supervisor was supportive and brought me a glass of water, assuring me I did the right thing before leaving me alone for 10 minutes until I felt well enough to return to work. 

Agnes did not return to the store to retrieve her bank card until a few days later. She got confronted by my supervisor for 'Cussing at members of staff', but she denied everything. My supervisor didn't believe her (later told me it was because she has done this before) and I have not seen her since.",TalesFromRetail,2048,1556851236

avgtiddygothgf,"""You like DnD?""","Hey y'all, this is just a short little memory from my old job. I'll be ""me"" and my clueless coworker will be CC.

Okay so I worked at a gas station for about five months working the 2-10. When I moved to a new town with friends, I had to switch to overnights (9pm-7am) at a location in my new town. On my first night there I had someone there to help since there were different tasks for an overnight than for the 2-10 shift I was use to. This guy was so clueless and completely lacked social awareness. 

CC: do you like DnD?

Me: not really.

CC: look at this meme

Meme: *is DnD related*

Me: I don't get it? 

CC: it's DnD.

Me: yea, and I just told you that I don't really like DnD.

CC: *continues to show me DnD related things until he leaves at like 3am*

The guy didn't even show me how to do the things I needed to do, but I only lasted 4 shifts there anyway.",TalesFromRetail,1308,1556739288
discardedMenace,Lady tries returning products she already used,"So I work at a craft store and yesterday I worked my first 8 hour shift. And for some reason a ton of wack people decided to come through my store yesterday. So here's a collection of stories!

---

We were pretty busy around noon, and we don't have very many carts. I'm up front working cash register, and a lady comes up to me. 

C: Do you have any more carts?
Me: Sorry, I just sent someone out to look for carts. It looks like all of our carts are in use at the moment. 
C: Oh, okay. Can you look again?
Me: [having just checked like 5 minutes ago] Uh, yeah sure.

I radio in and ask someone if they can go since I have a bit of a line. The lady just hovers next to the cash register and stares at me. I'm kinda uncomfortable, but I just keep on keeping on and ringing people up. 

After a few minutes the lady clears her throat pointedly and I look over.

C: Okay, this is UNACCEPTABLE. I'm going to go next door to [Red Circle Store] and if there aren't any carts when I get back, you're going to be in HUGE trouble.

I went on my lunch before she came back so I don't know how that ended.

---

A lady comes in with a return. Okay, no biggie. She pulls out five bias tapes and two receipts and puts them on the counter.

C: Okay, here's the deal. I bought this bias tape at the store in [neighboring city]. They were all 20% off. But I decided to exchange a few of them for another color and then buy some more, and I didn't get the discount. 
Me: Oh, did you want to return these and re-ring them up with the discount?
C: No, I just want the discount on the entire purchase.
Me: Well... I can't give you a discount on your whole purchase if you don't have all of the product here with you. 
C: I already sewed the other bias tapes. Can't you return the ones I have and tack on the extra amount?
Me: Uh... unfortunately I'm not able to do that since I need the actual product to be able to do return.
C: Ugh. Okay, here's the deal. Why don't you return these, and when you ring me up, give me a discount of $5.60 to make up for the discount I didn't get.
Me: [not wanting to incur the rage of a middle aged white lady] ...Yeah, sure. I can do that.

Well, turns out the computer didn't want me to do that. I called my manager to deal with it because I was so confused and I guess she was able to appease her. You're my hero, manager.

This one is a little shorter and less wack.

I was ringing up this lady who had a ~5 year old girl with her. The mom puts a few things down and the little girl puts down two bottles of pink glue next to it. I ring up all of the mom's things, then grab a bottle of glue and scan it. The mom yells ""WAIT, NO"" and she lunges across the counter and grabs it from my hand. The mom said the daughter had put it down without asking and she wasn't getting it. I, in shock, just go ""uh... okay"" and void the one I had scanned.

TL;DR: Middle aged white ladies in a craft store are not a force to be reckoned with.",TalesFromRetail,1249,1556472448
Decadorian,Man calls police on my store for giving the correct change.,"I work as an assistant manager at a large crafts retailer. One day I am on a register helping out with busy lines when I get an older couple at my register. I ring everything up and then she pays in cash. After I give the wife (W) the change she asks if she could get change for 2 dollars in quarters. I say alright and take the two dollars and give her 8 quarters. I thought everything was perfect until the husband (H) chipped in.  

H: You need to give my wife the correct change. She gave you two dollars...  

Me: I did give her the correct change sir.  

H:  No you didn’t. I was standing here the whole time. You need to learn how to count money correctly.  

Me:  I took 2 one dollar bills from her and gave her...  

H: Don’t explain your mistake to me. Talk to my wife and apologize to her.  

The husband then proceeds to leave the store while I’m standing there with his wife. She gives me a sympathetic look like she knows I was right.  

W: I’m sorry about that. I will just be taking my things and leaving now. Thank you.  

She leaves the store and meets her husband outside. I’m watching through the doors as her husband approaches her, probably asking if I gave her the right change. All of a sudden he starts shaking angrily and stomps back in to the store.  I’m standing there thinking “Oh ****. What is this guy’s problem?”  

The man stomps right in front of me and gives me a dirty look.  

H:  I want to talk to the highest manager here right now!  

I call the store manager and he meets the guy up front.  

H: This idiot needs to learn how to count change correctly. My wife gave him 2 dollars and your idiot gave her 8 quarters.  

Manager:  8 quarters IS 2 dollars sir. But we can check the cameras above the register just to make sure everything was done correctly if you’d like.  

H: Don’t waste your time. You are both stupid beyond compare. I’m calling the police.

The police show up and ask what is going on. We state everything that happened and even offer to show them the cameras. The police say theres no need and ask if they want us to escort the man off the property. The store manager says yes because he is banning the man from our store.  

I still have no idea why that guy thought 8 quarters wasn’t 2 dollars.  

tl;dr Man thinks 8 quarters in change isn’t equal to 2 dollars. Calls the police on us and gets banned from our store.",TalesFromRetail,2909,1556388246
Moonstruckderp,Your daughter did what with lipgloss?!,"I'm on mobile, English is my first language but I am dyslexic so prepare for some bad spelling and or grammar mistakes.

Players of this story. AM: angry mom. AD: angry dad. BM: bowel movement... uh I mean boss man. Me: mischievous entity. 

So for a little back story. I worked in a small women's clothing store in the mall, it was based more around Chinese/ Japanese clothing styles. BM ran another store at the other end of the mall with Chinese furniture and other random bits thrown in for good measure. 

I should add BM is a horrible man with no commonsense, and I seriously disliked working for him. Now on with the story.

It had been a slow day, school was still in so I had been cleaning up in the store, dusting sorting the clothes, because if I didn't my boss would call me while watching the camera feed. Making sure I was doing something. 

Suddenly I heard the distinct sound of people stomping their way over so I turned around and walked back up to the register.

AD: Hello do you sell lipgloss here? 

This man looked like he wanted to reach over the counter and strangle me.

Me: we sell lip gloss. It's all right here on the counter in the front.

AD: No not like that.

I sat there confused wondering what this guy could be talking about. This man was fuming and his wife looked like she wanted to cry but was holding back as hard as she could.

AD: My daughter told me she came to a mall and went to a Chinese store in the mall and bought some lip gloss out of a case. When she got home she opened it to put it on and tased herself in the face.

Instant horror and recognition filled my face as a light popped on in my head. The other store my boss ran sold small weapons as well. Small knives, daggers, swords, and hidden tasers. Someone at his store had sold a teenager a small taser and she zapped herself in the face.

I tuned back in at that point.

AD: We tried the Himalayan store downstairs but they pointed us up here. So where did our daughter get that lip gloss?

He still looked like he wanted to start screaming at me with everything he had.

Me: I'm sorry that happened sir, but we do not sell tasers here. I can point you to the store at the far end of the mall. I know the sell small weapons so that might be your best lead. I'm terribly sorry that happened to your daughter and I hope that she is alright.

I watched as the dad spun on his heal and marched off like a man on a mission, his wife tailing behind him looking like she wanted to fight someone.

I looked up at the camera and pointed at it shaking my head, not sure if he had been watching the show through the cameras that had been installed a few weeks before.

Honestly I never found out what happened with that story even though I asked a few employees about it but they didn't know either. I really hope the girl was alright. But who the hell buys lip gloss out of a weapon case?!

TLDR: Teenagers bright idea to light up her face has disastrous results.",TalesFromRetail,1152,1556338033

I make closing announcements 15 minutes, 5 minutes and then the actual closing announcement. 
There's this lady who is continuing to shop after we closed.
A night crew member goes up to her and goes ""Ma'am were closed"" 

She ignores him. 

He says it again. 

Ignored. 

He says it again and she goes ""I know."" All nasty. 

So ten minutes after closing, i decide to call the police to escort her out. The police and the lady are argueing in the parking lot and one of the cops walk up to me and goes 
""She talking crazy"" 

I give him my side of the story and because she got so aggressive police had to ensure she wouldn't come after me or my co worker as we walked to our cars. 

Now, i dont care if you need to grab like one or two things more after I made the closing announcemt but if you CONTINUE to shop and then be rude to an employee when you know we closed 10 minutes ago then it's extremely rude, and inconsiderate.

lilredsnapper,"Lady yells at another customer for ""taking her piece of salmon""","When I was in high school, I worked at a fish market.

One afternoon when I was working this lady walks in and one of my coworkers goes out to help her (we'll call him B). The lady wants to buy a kind of smoked salmon that we made at the store, which was quite popular. Because it was so popular usually what we kept out on display was not all we had (we almost always had more in the walk-in fridge in the back.) Anyways, so the lady tells B how much she wants but is indecisive about whether or not she wants another piece so B puts the amount she asked for on the scale and is waiting for her to make a decision. While she is still thinking another customer walks in and I go out to help him. The guy asks for a piece of the same kind of smoked salmon so I grab the last piece in the display case and put it on the other scale. The lady then turns to my customer and says to him ""hey you took my piece!"" B then tells her that there is more in the back and that he can grab her another piece. While B is trying to calmly remedy the situation I ring my customer out and as he leave he politely tells her to ""have a good day"" and she yells at him to ""F\*\*\* off""

After B has gone to the back gotten her another piece and rung her up she then starts to leave and tells us that she ""knows the manager and he will hear about this.""

After the whole ordeal we go back and tell our manager asks us exactly what happened (he was at the store, in the back) and we tell him. He then tell us that he has no idea who lady is (there was a window in the wall separating the front and the back so he could see but not necessarily hear) and that from what we told him, we handled it exactly how he would have.",TalesFromRetail,612,1556229580
VitaminChtonian,I refuse to say 'no' to my child so I'll use 'octopus',"A few years ago, I worked at a toy store. It's in area where conservative meets alternative so it's a mishmash of parenting styles and behaviours from the kids.

&amp;#x200B;

One interaction that stuck in my mind was a mother who looked like she rubbed a magical bong three times, and wished for the Greenie Genie to teleport her and her beatnik-looking kid from Woodstock '69 to the 21st century.

&amp;#x200B;

Within 2 seconds of entering, the kid flies to the front counter where keep all of the dollar-toys. Stamps, rubber balls, fidget spinners, slinkies, those kinds of toys.

&amp;#x200B;

He starts pulling out a pair of wooden aeroplanes from the shelf and begins a pretend dogfight. The mother flips out and I can tell she wants to take the toys off him but is restraining herself.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead she just says ""Octopus! Octopus!"" over and over again. It sounded like a command.

&amp;#x200B;

At first I assumed she named her kid Octopus, she was 'alternative' after all. However, after she then said the name 'Snoopy' (not real name), I realised the kids name was not Octopus but we also didn't stock any aquatic animal toys where Snoopy was playing.

&amp;#x200B;

The mother notices me watching from behind the register and she looks at me apologetically.

&amp;#x200B;

Octomum: ""I'm sorry, he keeps touching the toys when I told him he could look around only.""

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't mad, kids are kids and plenty of them go nuts when they enter a toy store.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Oh...was he looking for an octopus toy?""

&amp;#x200B;

Snoopy stops playing, just looks up at me and the mother quickly hushes me and gets real close.

&amp;#x200B;

Octomum: ""I'm trying to raise my boy with positive words. The real word is so negative so I'm substituting it for octopus.""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""What real word?""

&amp;#x200B;

She lowers her voice to a whisper. She is panicking that her answer might be overheard and undo 5 years of parenting and transform her son into a rebel that protects the Establishment.

&amp;#x200B;

Octomum: ""Fourteenth letter followed by fifteenth letter""

&amp;#x200B;

It took me a bit to realise 'octopus' was used instead of 'no'.

fake-southerner,I got caught “checking the back” by a customer 😬,"I work at a popular southern grocery store chain at the customer service desk. For whatever reason, numerous produce trucks haven’t been making it to our store for the past couple of weeks, so our stock has been very low. As we’re a neighbor store and small anyways, we usually direct the customers 10 minutes down the road to another location if they’re that desperate for strawberries. 

Our store is GREAT about keeping the shelves stocked. There is never anything “in the back.” If we have it, it’s on the shelf. If the shelf is empty, we are out of stock. 

During the day, there is a 2-4 hour window where there is no one working the produce department, so customer after customer kept coming up to the desk and insisting we check the back for more strawberries, despite us telling them that we were out, and at the time I was helping this customer, the truck was an hour away. Even if there was a back to check, I have no idea where they store the extra produce, or how to add strawberries I found in the back to add it to the inventory so I could sell it to this grouchy guy. 

This customer was INSISTING I went to the “back” to check “both coolers” (there’s no coolers just one cold prep room so idk what he was talking about) and we trying to convince us to let him go back and check himself, which our course we couldn’t let him do, so I went to the prep room to “look.” There was absolutely no produce in that room, but it was also cold AF so I stood in the hallway next to the room for about 30 seconds to make him feel better about me looking around. I’m sure every retail worker has been there. The customers always believe in the magical “back” where we hide all the merchandise from them. But this guy came and pressed his face up against the door so he could see me standing there looking max and get he was taking me away from my job. Whoops 😬",TalesFromRetail,3017,1555943043
TEAgaming2154,Cheapskate lady is offended by the price of our least expesive clothes dryer.,"I've posted here before, and this is going to be a quick little tale today as it just happened yesterday. Also sorry for formatting, on mobile.

I work at a hardware store that also sells new home appliances. The appliance department is quite successful in sales due to us being the only place in town to buy them, plus we service what we sell.

Yesterday I had to man the department as my coworker was at lunch and we were shorthanded as usual. This lady comes back to my desk and asks for help picking out a new dryer. Ok, nothing out of the ordinary, I take her over to the dryers and she says that she wants our most basic, least expensive unit. We get over there, and the conversation goes as such:

CL: Cheap lady
ME: Me

CL: Do you have any other new dryers that are a lot cheaper than THAT?

ME: Again, this new unit here is the most basic, least expensive model we have.

CL: Do you have any sales or discounts going on?

ME: We don't have any sales going on, and we only discount appliances if you buy three or more at once, or if the unit has cosmetic damage from shipping. We have a used dryer for $249 if you would like.

CL: Is it in good shape? How old is it?

ME: It has been repaied to working order by our service department and it is about 10 years old.

(I show her the used one, the paint is scratched quite a bit, and the white plastic parts are yellowed, but the unit is perfectly functional)

CL: Oh, I don't want this, look at all these scratches and the yellowed plastic!

ME: Those imperfections are only cosmetic and in no way affect its functionality.

CL: Ok, how much would you charge to deliver to [next town over]?

(We deliver up to 120 miles from the store, and we charge labor and fuel)

ME: Since [next town over] is 80 miles away, the delivery charge would be $129 extra and we will bring the new one inside and take your old one and scrap it for parts or refurbish it for resale.

CL: Forget it. I didn't think getting a dryer and having it delivered would be THIS expensive.

(She leaves the store without buying anything)


TL;DR Cheap lady wants a new dryer but doesn't want to pay the full price for it, ends up leaving without the new dryer she wanted.",TalesFromRetail,1309,1555870246

The store I work at uses an icing for cakes that is less sweet than other stores and can be quite popular with people. We don't actually sell it but my manager is willing to sell it to people who ask nicely or need a whole case at cost. I have a small amount of authority and can do this as well within reason.

Customer: ""Do you sell your icing? It's so good and I only need a little""

Me: ""Normally no but we do on occasion sell cases of it to people.""

Customer: ""I don't need a full case. I just need a little bit.""

Me: \*deciding I'll be nice\* ""I can sell you one of the bags in the case but I can't go any lower since these don't have a code or a price in the tills."" 

I get a coworker who just so happens to be carrying a case of icing to give it to me. I open the case and pull out the bag and give the box back. One bag weighs no more than a pound but one pound of icing is still a lot.

Me: ""This is one bag""

Customer: \*stares at it bug-eyed\* ""but I don't need that much! Can't you sell half of that?""

Me: ""no we can't. These aren't in the system and there's no price on them. The smallest I can go is a bag.""

Customer: ""how much is a bag?""

Me: ""well let's see. A full case costs us $50 so one bag would be $25""

Customer: \*eyes go big again\* ""That much?! Can't you give it for a better price?""

Me:  ""I'm sorry but no, that is the lower price that we can sell it for""

Customer: ""well is there someone higher up that can override you?""

Me: ""I'm sorry but no, this is literally the price we pay for this. We can't give sell it for less.""

Customer: ""I don't need that much though! Can't you just sell half of that?""

Me: \*getting a little annoyed\* ""no we can't. We aren't even supposed to be selling it at all.""

Customer: ""isn't there someone higher up that I can talk to that can override you?""

Me: ""no. There is no manager who will sell this lower since this what we pay for it.""

Customer: ""then I don't want it then"" \*walks away\*

Me: \*turns to coworker who had been eavesdropping close by and gives back the bag\* ""Do we look like a charity or something?""

BrookerTJustice,Dad Thinks He Got Same Product For 1/2 Price,"For a couple years I did some occasional work for a family friend, he was part owner of a company that sold merchandise at soccer tournaments. The company had some pretty major contracts and literally would get it's inventory directly from the brands, ie contact Nike with the product orders and hope they could fill it. This didn't prevent people from thinking we were selling knock-off or overpriced products, which does happen at smaller local tournaments. There we are selling at a boys tournament with about 80 teams from all over the country, the week prior was the girls tournament and with the same number of teams. I typically ran the smaller tent at the smaller venue but would end the night at the main tent if they were still open. It's pretty late 8-9pm, usually about the time we start wrapping up, when this dad shows up with a Nike hoodie for us to heat press the event logo onto, the logos are to heat press on the non-event product we carry but when we start running low on product we give some leeway. The dad said something along the lines of, ""I knew those hoodies weren't worth 60 bucks, I got that at the outlet and it was only 30!"" The only things we wouldn't sell at MSRP were event product because those also included the price of being screen-printed and even then it was only an extra 5 dollars. While going to heat press it I look at the tag and he was right, he got the hoodie for 30 dollars and it was the same style, except it was a much lower quality material and you didn't even have to touch it to tell because it looked like lower quality material. Regardless, I heat press the logo onto the hoodie, fold it so the logo is facing up, and hand it back to him. He takes the hoodie and leaves thinking he outsmarted us, while a couple of the other dads from his son's team apologize for his behavior.",TalesFromRetail,1111,1555792947
KitsuneExistISwear,If you don’t give me my computer I’m gonna call the cops!!!,"Hello! So I’m not entirely sure if this fits here because my job is split between retail sales and repair work, but it’s definitely about the stupidity of customers so I’m gonna pick here. If I’m wrong let me know! 

So it’s an average weekday morning, I’m in the back hiding away from the floor working on some repair I don’t remember. The phone rings and I pick up and give my usual cheery greeting despite my state as a soulless husk that pines for death.

Me: Hello! Thank you for calling [blank] how may I help you?

Customer: Yeah, I’m just calling to check up on my repair. I left it with you guys like a week ago and haven’t heard anything.

M: Okay! What name is the repair under sir?

C: [Blankety blank] and it’s a 2014 MacBook Pro 15”.

M: Got it!

I put him on hold to look through my system and can’t find him there. One of my coworkers is sort of dumb and will often misspell customer names. I have found the name Jennifer spelled like Xeniffer. So I try common misspellings. Still nothing.

Me: Hello, sir? I’m trying to find you in our system but I’m having trouble. I think your name might have been misspelled. Can you please give me your phone number so I can find you?

Customer: This is ridiculous, but whatever. Fine. It’s 555-555-5555.

Me: Thanks!

So now he’s getting pissy which is AWESOME. Love that. I try to find him in our system by phone number and nope. Nothing. So I rope my Awesome Manager in. He says to try and see if we have him in the sales side of the system. Try both name and phone number and nothing. My manager asks what model computer and I tell him and we both look for it. Nothing. So I pull him off hold and say something that causes everything to explode. 

Me: Sir, we can’t seem to find you anywhere in our system. Not in sales or service. I also cannot find that exact model in our store. We currently do not have any 15” MacBook Pros in for repair. Are you sure you left your unit with us?

Customer: This is the [town] location right?

M: Yes sir it is.

C: *UNINTELLIGIBLE YELLING* I LEFT IT WITH YOU PEOPLE AND YOU LOST IT?!?!?

I immediately hand the phone to my Awesome Manager and he takes over trying to calm the dude down. He yells at my manager for a few more minutes and my manager asks him questions.

Awesome Manager: What does the computer look like?

Customer: It’s covered in stickers which the guy who took it in commented on!!!!

AM: Okay what did the tech who took it in look like?

C: He was tall, dyed red hair, nose ring, and tattoos.

AM: .....Sir, none of our techs here fit that description.

C: *MORE SCREECHING* I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU DON’T FIND MY COMPUTER I’M GONNA CALL THE COPS AND HAVE YOU ALL ARRESTED!!!!

So now I get the idea that maybe he left it at another location or a similar store. I start calling around while he’s still yelling at my boss and he’s trying to calm him down. I call a store we’re friends with (I went to high school with the GM) who often refers customers to us if they can’t help them. They answer and I ask for the Service Manager there.

Me: Hey [name]! Got a weird question. Got a really mean customer by the name of [blank] who’s calling convinced he left his unit with us but he can’t find it. I know you got tats and a nose hoop and that’s the description he gave us so....

Service Manager: Yeah I do *laughs* what’s the model and name again?

M: [model] and [name]. He says it should be covered in stickers.

SM: Oh yeah we got it. I actually gave him a call yesterday.

M: GREAT. Thank you!!

I flag my boss down and tell him I found it and it’s at our friend store. He looks so relieved and tells the customer.

Customer: *ranting*

Awesome Manager: Sir.....SIR! I just got word that we found your unit.

C: ABOUT TIME!

AM: Yes sir it’s at [friend store] and they actually recently gave you a call to ask if you wanted to proceed.

C: ........................rude. *hangs up*

We both looked at each other and just laughed at how stupid and rude he was and I couldn’t WAIT to text my GM friend about the stupid customer they had incoming.

Reset108,"Credit card processing is down, take it up with the deli department, that makes sense.","Another story recently reminding me of a story from a few years back when I worked in a grocery store deli department.   

There was some glitch with the credit card processing that day and they couldn’t accept credit cards for buying stuff.    It was rather wide spread, not just our store.     People could still buy with cash or check though. 

Anyway, they had put up a sign by the front door and were making announcements over the PA system every so often.   

The front end was busy, with people not realizing until too late that they wouldn’t be able to buy their groceries.   All of us in perishable departments were busy running back and forth to collect shop-backs that weren’t sold.     It was frustrating store wide.  

Anyway, I get a lady at the deli counter that wants some deli meat sliced a certain way.     Get that for her and she goes on her way.   

Around 10 minutes later, there’s an announcement over the PA about the credit card system being down.  

Cue angry customer coming back to the deli.   

Angry customer “hey, how am I supposed to buy this now?”  (Basically throwing the package of meat at me). 

Me “sorry?”   

AC “don’t have my checkbook or enough cash to buy all my stuff”

Me “yeah, sorry about that, there’s some glitch in the system, from what I’ve heard, they have no idea when it will be back up”.  

AC “now what do I do?”   

Me “well there is an atm near the front of the store if you wanted to get cash out to buy your stuff.   Did you want this deli meat still?”   

AC “No I want to know how soon it will be back up”.  

Me “sorry, I have no idea since I work back here and not the front end”.  

AC “It’s your job to know these things”.  

Me “it’s really, really not”.  

AC “fine, you’ve just lost a customer”.  She leaves her cart sitting there in front of the deli counter and leaves.   

And then came back the next day when the system was back up, got her deli meat sliced exactly the same as the day before, neither of us said a word about what happened the day before.   It was like it never happened.",TalesFromRetail,1153,1555592320
strangeWolf17,Customer leaves me his car keys and chequebook,"So I had quite the interesting shift yesterday. I work in a post office, and while I was helping someone, this customer comes up behind her and tries to get my attention. (C for customer)

C: Excuse me! Sir! I need help!

Me: Hi, sir. I'll just be a moment with you. I'm just helping someone.

C: Okay.

So after I finish with the customer in front of him, I ask him what he needs help with, to which he explains that he needs to send out multiple cheques because his mom passed away? (I didn't catch the full reasoning, but I was kinda having a hard time understanding him). I tell him I'm sorry for his loss and offer him an envelope.
So I handed him an envelope and a pen, and he let me take the customer behind him (which was generous, especially since there was a good line forming at this point). As I finish helping the customer that was behind him, he looks at me and sighs, getting frustrated.

C: Can you please help me fill these cheques out? I need help. Where do I put my credit card number?

Me: I'm sorry sir, I don't think I can fill the cheque out for you. Also, I don't think you need to put your credit card number on the cheque.

C: Here, I need help please.

He hands me the pen, and before I know it, he's reading his credit card number out loud, loud enough for probably half the store to hear.

Me: Sir, I'm sorry but you'll have to fill the cheque out yourself, and I also wouldn't advise reading your number out loud there. 

C: No, you don't understand, my mom just passed away!

Me: Yes, I'm sorry to hear that, but I can't do this for you. I'll try my best to guide you through, but I unfortunately can't manually write it for you.

He then starts getting worked up. and calls his dad(?) and they start yelling at each other over the phone. So this guy is standing in front of my till, and I'm trying to take customers around him while he stands there, just yelling nonstop on the phone (it was speaker phone too). This went on for a good 45 mins or so before he finally fills the cheques out and just before I think he's ready to send it, he asks me where to send it.

Like, I'm sorry, but how am I supposed to know where to send YOUR cheques?

I explain to him that I don't have the answer to that, and suggested he call the bank to figure out the address, and he did just that. Only, he decided the best place to call was right in front of my counter. So now, I'm trying to take customers around him again while he's yelling on the phone. Luckily the customers were understanding but oh man it was frustrating. The worst part: this lasted for around 2 hours.

After those two hours, however, this customer decides to leave the store and tells me he'd be back. It was only until after he left that I realized he had left his car keys, wallet, chequebook, and glasses on my counter. I sigh and take his stuff, putting it behind me so no one takes it. He left for around 45 mins, and during that time, I was helping other customers and putting away packages that were dropped off earlier. Everything was okay, until he came back.

He then showed me a few addresses and asked me to write it on the envelope, so I did. Then, he asks for the fastest service, and so I tell him how much it is (it was around $14) and he agrees to it. So I tell him his total, and then he begins complaining to me, saying it was too much and I ripped him off, and so I'm just beyond frustrated at this point, but manage to keep my cool, explaining everything to him in the most professional way I can (though I'm tired of him, since he'd been there for almost 3 hours collectively).

He finally gives up and hands me the money, and just when I'm about to give him his change, he starts talking on the phone again and pacing around. So I'm just standing there with his change, while a young couple is waiting behind him, pretty confused. I eventually give up and put his change and receipt off to the side along with the rest of his belongings so the couple isn't waiting. 

Once they get up to my till, I apologize and they're super forgiving, and just as I thought I was done with this guy, he interrupts me mid-transaction with these people to ask where his change was, to which I exchange no words, and just point at it on the counter. 

He lingers around my till for another 15 minutes or so, still yelling in his phone before finally leaving. 


I honestly am still so confused, but wow it was quite the shift.",TalesFromRetail,854,1555558053
barney_chuckle,What do you mean I can't buy cigarettes with my underage brother?,"So two young lads walk up to my till at my supermarket job and the slightly older looking one asks for a pack of cigs.

BearyBrooke,No Ma'am We Won't Do Your Taxes That Were Due Yesterday,"So I'm a receptionist for a company that does insurance and taxes. Yesterday, we were told that we completed 1018 taxes. That's a lot of taxes for us. However, one woman today just couldn't help but make a scene. We'll call the woman Julia.

So Julia calls and I'm the one to answer the phone. Lucky me.

Me: This is (Insurance Company Name), my name is BearyBrooke, how may I assist you?

Julia: I need you to do my taxes.

Now her attitude took be aback but I decided to continue being friendly. It's part of the job but taxes were supposed to be due yesterday. Yet this woman decided to do her taxes the day after they're supposed to be done. We've had people come in to do their taxes at the last second yesterday but I haven't had someone who wanted us to do them after they were supposed to be done.

Me: I'm sorry but-.

Julia: Now, I need you to do my taxes from 2016, 2017 and 2018.

So not only did she want us to do her taxes that were supposed to be done yesterday (unless you owe and got an extension) but now she wants us to do 3 years worth of taxes. It was unbelieveable to me.

Me: Excuse me but-.

Julia: How much will it be for you to do all those taxes? H&amp;R Block was waaaaay too expensive! And I'm-!

Me: I'm sorry to interrupt but taxes were due yesterday. We're not taking in anyone else for this year. 

Julia: Excuse me! Don't just interrupt me!

Me: I'm really sorry but-.

Julia: Ugh, you're so rude! I want to talk to your supervisor!

Me: Okay ma'am, can you please hold for a moment?

Julia: Whatever!

My boss was listening to our conversation though. He was working with the other receptionist and was listening to me. He didn't know what she was saying but he could tell I was trying to be extra cautious when speaking to her. He's a good boss. I put the woman on hold and quickly turn to my boss who was standing nearby. 

Me: She wants to speak to you. I tried to tell her we couldn't do her taxes but she got really angry with me when I tried to explain it.

He rolled his eyes and I transferred the call to him. He went to his office and talked to the woman. Basically, she complained about how horrible of an employee I was and that she just wanted to get her taxes done. My boss told her that taxes were due yesterday and that we wouldn't take in anymore. The best part was when she accused him of lying and he straight up told her to just Google when taxes are due in 2018 and she'll see she's wrong. She did look them up on her tablet and then when she saw that we were right, she hung up the phone.

We had a good laugh afterwards and are going to celebrate Tax Season ending tonight.",TalesFromRetail,2493,1555427184
Odarien,Smoking weed and shopping may be hazardous to your wallet.,"Hey! It's me your not so friendly neighborhood graveyard store clerk. I bring to you a tale from a year ago that I often bring up to friends when they ask about interesting things and maybe you'll find it interesting too.

Its past midnight and foot traffic is dying down now that beer sales have stopped. In comes this guy with several foot long dreadlocks in a ""ponytail"" of sorts. the moment he steps through the door I'm hit in the face with the powerful scent of someone who just smoked a ton of weed. Some of the remaining customers give him weird looks as the smell fills the store but he pays them no mind. 

He walks past me and over to the drinks but stops and stares at a display. It was a lollipop display for ""pinwheel"" pops. Imagine big circular lollipops and have a loose bit of plastic through the very center so you can spin them like a pinwheel. He chuckles and gives one a spin. I stop watching him at this point as I have other customers coming up and giving me their things. 

Several customers and minutes I glance over at the guy and hes still at the display. Now trying to get as many of the pops to spin at once as he can. I clear my throat at this point and ask him ""Sir do you need help with anything?:

Him: ""nah man it's all good"" I'm now keeping a close eye on him in case he tries to pocket them but instead he grabs the **ENTIRE** display and walks over to my counter and puts it on there. ""Dude I want all of these man, my friends will love em!""

I'm now very caught off gaurd as no one has ever bought a full display...ever. ""are you sure? There things are 3$ a piece."" I ask as I'm unsure what to do other thing ring him up. 

""Yeah man! These are awesome!"" He gives the lollipops another spin and looks completely lost in them. . The whole thing Totalled nearly 80$ and he paid with cash. He walks off with the display looking like he just won the jackpot while I'm left rather confused and a little guilty. 

Hes a regular and I asked him the next day if he wanted to return any. And he shook his head ""nah man, I'm good"".

So that's my story, I find it entertaining at least and I hope you lot do too.",TalesFromRetail,2043,1555320525
trickstersgambit,The cutest child ever,"I've said in a previous post about this job on a different sub that I used to work at a children's clothing boutique.

This lead to encounters with kids of all kinds, and since I was a babysitter on the side, I had a good deal of experience and patience with them. 

But this isn't about the rambunctious or loud children. This is about the sweetest four year old I've ever met.

So the boutique, by order of our owner, had to play older music from between the 20s and 60s. Good wholesome music, as he insisted. So we did. It got mind numbing after a point. There's only so many times you can hear ""the leader of the pack"" and not go a little bonkers.

On the day in question, the slacker station we were listening to (me and my customers that is) was cycling through various pop songs and Johnny Cash. I heard a LOT of him that day. A Man Named Sue, Ring of Fire, ect.

So this mom and her toddler walk in, and she lets him go looking through the racks. Not unusual for the shop or for mom's. He was well behaved and would pick things out to hand them to his mom. It was adorable and he seemed really confident and competent.

Eventually they're out of my sight, going through the samples rack in the back where things are as much as 70% off, and you can find some clothes that are out  of season or have little defects or imperfections.  Its all the way at the back of the shop and around the corner.

The station cycled to A Man Named Sue and I hear these rapid stomps from the back and this tiny voice starts BELTING the lyrics and bouncing up and down between the racks flapping his hands. His mom scrambles out and starts to apologise, going to hush her son

""No, don't worry about it. He's not hurting anything and it looks like he's happy""

""He LOVES Johnny Cash. He began to listen to it at home and at his grandparents house. He knows all the lyrics""

This four year old otherwise quiet and well behaved child had a special interest in Johnny Cash and it made my day and got me through a twelve hour shift. I don't mind the music so much now.",TalesFromRetail,1022,1555286985
C0wdC0nr01,Attempted Stealing Turned Assault Charge,"Background: I work at a service station (petrol garage), usually doing a pretty wide range of shift times. The store isn’t located in a bad area but we still get more than our fair share of customers who might need reminding they actually have to PAY for things before attempting to leave. We are told by managers that we should remind them of such, but if they get confrontational or insist on leaving, we’re simply to call the cops immediately, pull up the CTV footage and put that person on the band from store list. 

So, one fine rainy afternoon, I’m the only one out front. My co-worker is in the back rearranging fridges and other stock. We’re mostly quiet so I’m doing some paperwork behind the til when in comes Crazy Lady (CL). 

From the minute CL came in, she looked pretty shifty. So of course I’m keeping a discrete eye on her as she meanders through the aisles. I watch as CL shoves a whole range of items into her jumper before she comes up to the til. The only thing she places down to pay for is an ice cream and she asks for smokes. 

As is procedure, I go through with the transaction and wait until the CL turns to leave the store (making her intention to steal clear). 

Me: Excuse me, ma’am. You’ll either need to return the items you’ve stashed in your jumper or you need to pay for them. 

CL (immediately starts yelling): WHAT ITEMS? IVE NOT GOT ANY! 

Me: Ma’am, this store is under video surveillance. I witnessed you place items in your jumper. If you won’t return or pay for them, then I’ll have to call the police. 

At this point CL starts hurling abuse, cussing and generally being an upstanding citizen. She proceeds to open up her jacket, releasing everything she’s taken to fall on the floor, and makes a point of stomping on the items like a behaviourally challenged three year old. 

Me: (eager to de-escalate considering how she’s responded so far) Thank you ma’am. Please feel free to go.

This sets her off even worse. She throws the ice cream she’d just bought at me, although it’s still in a wrapper. While I’m standing there trying to process the fact I’ve just been hit in the chest by frozen dessert, the CL is going for the shelf filled with 2L bottles of soft drink that’s set up next to the door. 

And then she begins hurling them at me. 

Luckily I’m able to duck into a nearby aisle. Kind of panicking at this point because me being a small female against a clearly deranged customer are not great odds - that and if I did decide to defend me self via violence, I would no doubt be fired. 

Finally, after what felt like a life time, I hear the bell above the door go off, a loud slapping noise and the CL starts SCREECHING - like someone had simultaneously just killed her new born child and shoved a hot iron under her finger nails. 

I decide to risk taking a peek to see what’s set her off. Thankfully it’s the police! Two officers are pinning this woman to the ground and are hand cuffing her despite CL’s best impression of a fish-out-of-water- banshee hybrid. 

My co-worker had apparently heard the commotion and called the police. Luck was on our side in that a patrol car was only a street over. With CL struggling the entire way, they manage to cuff her and get her into their car.

To finish off a lengthy story, when asked I did indeed agree to have charges pressed. Because honestly, if someone is going to go that psychotic with that little provocation, they probably either need help or to just straight up not be on the street.",TalesFromRetail,1818,1555245331

MinxMonroe90,“Well pink is her favourite colour..”,"I’ve recently accepted that I may be a retail lifer. My longest position (and current) is within a department store in the women’s shoe department. In my almost ten years of retail I’ve collected many stories, similar to really anyone whose had to spend any significant amount of time around the general public. 

This didn’t actually happen to me. It was relayed to me by the co worker that actually encountered this, and years later it still holds a special level of “what the actual fuck are you doing?” 

This happened in previously mentioned shoe department. At the time we carried a line of popular wooden clogs that’s brand tag line is “I got nailed in Sweden.” These retailed from $150-$395 depending on the style. 

My coworker was on the sales floor when a women pushing a stroller containing her baby approached her with one of the clogs in hand. The one she had was on the higher end price points so from memory I think it was $350 at the time. 

“Excuse me, but you might not want to have this on the floor anymore. It’s ...gross” the woman said, handing my coworker the shoe. 

She said when she looked down on the shoe in questions she noticed brown, sticky smears all over the light coloured leather. 
“Oh my...what even is on this..I’m so sorry” my coworker began before the women cut her off.
“Oh it’s probably chocolate!” 

My coworker then noticed the baby in the stroller, which was supporting quite the beard of what was evidentially her previous chocolate treat across the bottom half of her face. 

“Did your baby have this??” She said she now noticed small cuts in the wood now. Almost as if ... “in her mouth??” 

“Well she’s teething. And I ran out of her snacks. I gave her the shoe to keep her quiet while I did some shopping. But you probably shouldn’t keep it as a sample anymore...” the cuts were bite marks. 

“You’re baby had this shoe in its mouth??!” My coworker said her mind started spinning thinking of all the various hands and feet that had been in contact with said shoe but quickly moved to this was a $300 shoe that this woman just blatantly let her child destroy. 

She asked the woman if she was intending to buy the shoe but the woman seemed confused. She replied something along the lines of that it wasn’t her size ...why would she buy it? 

Being a rather large company that also “prides itself on the customer experience” we’re limited in what could actually been done so the women left, probably still unaware that maybe giving your baby a dirty shoe that doesn’t belong to you isn’t the greatest alternative to just having actual teething solutions for your child. 

She was asked why that shoe and she replied matter of factly

darknite33,But I used my own container so it's free...right?,"Sorry for the longer post.  This happened at the convenience store/truck stop I worked at for 3 years.  I was a shift lead (I may not have mentioned that in other posts) and on this particular day I had been outside sweeping the parking lot.  There were 2 cashiers inside, one brand new (in training), and one fairly new (been there about 2 months).  As I was sweeping I noticed a young man (mid-20ish) walk out with a 2 liter pop but didn't pay a whole lot of attention until the new cashier came out a few seconds later an made a beeline toward me.

""Shift lead, that guy"", she pointed at the man with the 2 liter, ""he filled up that bottle from the fountain and walked out.  New cashier told me to come let you know.""

I told her to go on back inside and I would handle it.  I followed him around the corner of the building and found him wandering around behind the store.

""Excuse me sir, I need to talk to you for a minute.""  He stopped and faced me looking a bit confused.  ""You filled up that bottle from our fountain pop machine and didn't pay for it.""  He looked at the bottle in his hand and back at me.

""He said it was free.""

Now it was my turn to look confused.  ""Who said it was free?""

""That gut at the store.""

I was the only guy at the store at this time, the cashiers were female.  ""Sorry sir but the only guy here is me and I definitely did not give you permission to steal pop.""

""No, not you, the guy at the other store  He said since I brought in my own container it was free.""

After a bit of questioning the story was that this person had been at some other convenience store that was part of our chain of stores and a male cashier had told him that since he had brought in his own empty 2 liter he could fill it up free of charge.  First, we didn't allow certain types of containers to be refilled (Styrofoam, thin walled plastic cups, or any container that could not be washed and/or sanitized), and second, the pop was not free, period.  The cashiers had to pay for them, even at work so there was no way I was going to let some random stranger fill one up for nothing.

""Well sir, sorry but whatever the cashier may have told you at the other store does not apply here.""

""You mean that I can't get it free?""

""No sir, and if you do not come back inside and pay I will call the police.  I don't think you really want to go to jail for a dollar do you?""

He came back inside and ended up paying $1.05 with tax (I charged him for the 32 ounce refill).  I let him know that he should probably ask at each store he stopped at about the ""free refill"" before assuming since he may not run into someone as nice as me again.",TalesFromRetail,1655,1555094697

xmarsbarso,“I am a disabled veteran!!”,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I’m on mobile, bear with me friends. 
Yesterday at work i was the only cashier for 6 hours, it was kind of busy for a Tuesday but I’m used to it. While I’m ringing someone out a lady yells from the line that someone is causing trouble in the back of the store. I asked her what was going on and she replied “a man back there is being very disruptive. He’s yelling and cussing at his kid and pushing him into shelving.” I had never been met with this situation before and wasn’t sure what to do so I called my manager on the radio and had the woman explain to him what was going on. As my manager goes back the woman and a few other customers in line start to talk about this guy going completely overboard and shoving his 5 year old child. Finally the line starts to dwindle down and the next customers I have seemed to be talking about the situation too so I asked what was going on since I was stuck up front and hadn’t seen it. Yeah, that was a *huge* mistake. This was the family, the guy that was accused of berating and punishing his son harshly was face to face with me. He starts going OFF. “Apparently I can’t even discipline my own child! (name of our store) think they know the law, you guys don’t know the fucking law! it’s my fucking kid!” So I tell him that I wasn’t even aware of what was going on but he keeps yelling at me. “Your manager said he was gonna call the cops well where the fuck are they?!” I shrugged and again said “I’m not even aware of the entire situation” his wife tells him to calm down and forget about it then he grumbles some more and they leave. I’m thinking cool, it’s all over and done with. NOPE! A few hours later I went to talk to my manager about changing my availability and he says he just got off the phone with our district manager. Apparently the guy called customer service and complained. Saying things like “the manager cussed me out and told me it was none of my business(???) he doesn’t know the law, he told me he studied law in Florida. I am a disabled veteran and I demand respect! If I don’t get an apology from your store by tomorrow at 5pm I will be suing(my manager. Not the store, he wants to sue my manager specifically) I want him fired blah blah blah” My manager is actually really cool so he’s just laughing the entire time reading us the guy’s statement, where he includes his full name and a bunch of other information. My manager even went to his Facebook page and showed us all these pictures of him doing a variety of things and said “he doesn’t look disabled to me.” Anyway it’s 2019 and basically every store has cameras so my manager said he’ll have our loss prevention guy go through the footage and send it to the police. Since none of the customers who actually *saw* it wanted to stick around I had to write a report on what I saw.

Screech32210,But I wear a size 7?,"Today this lady asks for help in shoes, so I walk back to the shoe department with her.

Once again, she informs me of how upset she is that she had to ask for help. So I apologize again and ask what she needs. 

Finally, she grabs a sandal from the wall and tells me she needs a size 7. I fetch the size 7, remove the cardboard insert and hand it to her. She can barely squeeze her foot in, even with the straps completely loosened. 

“Wanna try a 71/2 or an 8?

“No, I wear a 7.”

“Okay, but that’s not fitting very well. Your heel is hanging a half inch off the back of the shoe. Looks like you should try sizing up, maybe a full size. I’ll grab an 8 for you”

“But I wear a 7? If it doesn’t fit, it just doesn’t fit”

“But an 8 *will* fit, just try it.”

She literally refused to try the 8. When I came back from the stock room she informed me that she would be trying a different store. I’m still so shocked at how ignorant people can be.",TalesFromRetail,689,1554952843
thezephyrsky,"Ma'am I am not discriminating against you, I just don't have any openings right now","Alright this is my very first reddit post, so I am hoping I put this story in the right subreddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

This story takes place last summer, I work as a front desk receptionist for a body waxing company and have been for the past 5 years. I am in charge of greeting customers, getting them checked in and out, booking appointments, etc. Our primary customers are pre-booked appointments, meaning they either pre-booked for their next appointment after their previous visit, or they called in ahead of time to schedule something for later that day. We gladly will take walk-ins, however it is only based on our availability. Scheduled appointments always come first.

&amp;#x200B;

I have dealt with a lot of difficult customers before in the past but none as un-deal-with-able as this lady. We'll call her Mrs. Elder (E). M=Me.   
E is a 60-something year old woman in a wheelchair. I can see her rolling up to our building, so I get up and open both of our doors to let her in.   
M: ""Hi how are you doing? Do you have a reservation today?""  
E: ""No I don't, I want a full face waxing""  
M: ""Okay sure! Let me see.."" I check the books to see that our next time spot was only 30 minutes away, ""I can put you down for 2:00, that's in about 30 minutes""  
E immediately gets pissed. ""No. You don't have anybody waiting in here, and your sign says you take walk ins, I want to get in now""  
M: ""There's no one in the waiting room because they are all in service, all of my waxers are busy, but I can still get you in at that 2:00 time""  
E: ""No, there's NO ONE in here!"" She's pointing to all of the empty seats, ""I want to get in NOW, if there's no one waiting that means I'm next and I can be seen because you take walk-in's!""  
M: ""Everyone in service has an appointment, we take walk-in's based on our availability, and all of my waxers are in service""  
E: ""You have the availability! There's NO ONE WAITING!""  
M: ""If you ever want guarantee a time spot to come in and be seen you can always call in to book an appointment--""  
E: ""No!  I'm never in the area, the bus drops me off and I never know when I'm going to be nearby, so I just want to walk in and be seen. You take walk-ins and I want to be seen, this is ridiculous!""  
I'm not good with confrontation, or with angry people so I felt kind of at a loss knowing that this lady was not going to understand how appointments work.  
M: ""Ma'am we have another customers in service right now, all of our waxers are busy at the moment, that's why there's no one in the waiting room.""   
E: ""NO you say that you take walk ins, you're discriminating against me! I am here, you take walk-in's and I want to be seen NOW""  
M: ""I am not discriminating against you"" I feel my whole body, face, neck, everything, heat up, ""I am not refusing service, I am just letting you know that our next time spot is at 2:00""  
E: ""NO, this is why us elders need to stick together, everyone's always against us and taking advantage of us""  
E rambled on more about how elders are discriminated against, and how we should be ashamed, blah blah etc.  


After some more back and forth, I desperately call my assistant manager (AM) over to help. She was checking out a customer who had just gotten out of service (and yes, that waxer still had another SCHEDULED guest about to walk through the doors, so I still wasn't able to get E back for service) My AM stepped over and asked what the issue was, E told her that she wanted to be seen for a full face wax, and that since there's no one waiting in the lobby that there's no reason why she shouldn't be seen. My AM begins to tell her the same thing I've been telling her, and E loses it again.  
At this point the customer (C) who my AM was checking out turns around to look at E.  
C: ""You really need to listen to what they're telling you, you are being extremely unreasonable--""  
E interrupts, shaking her finger in her face.  
E: ""I'M NOT TALKIN' TO YOU, I'M NOT TALKIN' TO YOU!""  
C: ""Then stop talking!""  
E: ""I'm not talking to you! You need to mind your own business.""  
C: ""Well you need to leave and stop harassing these girls""  
There was some more back and forth between them, and I can't remember a lot of what was said because I felt paralyzed. I have to admit this was THE MOST bitter-sweet moment of working in customer service. One on hand I was extremely uncomfortable and at a loss of words, I remember ALMOST ""breaking them up"" (god, I wonder how big of a fail that would have been) and on another hand it was soooo satifying to have a regular customer stand up for us and say the things that we couldn't say. They only argued or maybe a minute in total but it felt like forever.   


After they were done E started demanding for corporate's number, my AM gave it to her and she left, but not before demanding that we open up both doors for her so she could leave. Gladly. If you're wondering, we never got a complaint, or a negative review from her.  And I haven't seen her since, I just hope she doesn't go around harassing other businesses.",TalesFromRetail,846,1554951405
SaintLatona,A Wild Dog Appears!,"So this happened yesterday.  I work at a donation store in the back, processing stuff for sale.  I'm also deaf so I did not realize all this was happening until I noticed it.

So here I am, minding my own business at work when I felt something small jump on my leg.  I looked down and very nearly had a heart attack.  It was a Silky Terrier, jumping on my leg and running around me.  I looked behind me and saw my two managers along with the owner trying to get the dog to come to her.

The dog was completely ignoring her and continued its antics around my legs.  I just stood there like a statue and just stared at the dog, because THIS IS A SILKY TERRIER!  The owner had enough of the dog's antics and pinned it down and started to carry it off back to where I assumed her car was parked while she was donating stuff to our store.

That's when I mentioned that I used to own a Silky Terrier, but she got run over by a car in February.  I can't help but wonder if my dog sent this one to check up on me...",TalesFromRetail,1037,1554906669
rosesaremaroon,The Earlobe Story,"This is an infamous story among my friends and coworkers that happened just about 4 years ago. Some background: I was a teenager, had only worked one job before, and had started as a seasonal associate at a home improvement store. 

I was working the newly learned customer service desk, which is about an 18” wide counter. Im standing on one side, customer standing on the other. He puts his items on the counter for return and I start scanning them, all is normal. 

I’m scanning along and I look up and see the man across the counter reach his hand out. I stood there, confused and unable to move because I had no idea what was going on. 

After what felt like way longer than it was, the man just C A R E S S E S  my earlobe. I look up, dumbfounded, and go, “What?”

Earlobe Man: It looked swollen...

Me: ???????????????

pinkksadie,Lady thinks I play with boxes,"So this was about 10 months ago..

I work in the front store of a chain pharmacy, we had just opened the store about 5 minutes prior to this woman walking into the store, she walked thru the doors and I greet her to which I get no response but just a stare. she then goes back thru the doors to grab a cart. While she is doing that I was gathering up a bunch of cardboard boxes that had been left behind the counter the night before, to take them back to the stockroom, normally I would put them in the compactor but since I knew someone was in the store I just left them back there and would take care of that part later on.

I figured since she had grabbed a cart that she would be looking around for at least a few minutes so I thought I was good to take the maybe 45 seconds it took to put the boxes in the back. 

I come back to the front and she is waiting in front of the photo counter so I ask her if I can help her with something to which she rudely replies that she needs to pick up a photo order. Mind you, this woman’s cart is still empty. I get her photos and check her out, continuing to use my best customer service voice as she continues to give me snarky and short responses. That was it, she had nothing else to purchase, so the cart was completely pointless. 

The transaction comes to an end and I tell her to have a nice day and she doesn’t respond to me. Then as she’s walking out the door she sarcastically says “have fun with your boxes!” 

I wanted to respond and tell her how I really felt, but I kept my mouth shut. But it doesn’t end there.

She then goes home and takes our customer survey, leaving a 1 out of 10 review saying that I waited until she was already in the store to pick up all the boxes, which I did while she was getting herself a cart which is outside of the front doors, then that I went to the back and made her wait 5 whole minutes before helping her. And that I was horribly rude the whole time.",TalesFromRetail,1510,1554824831
H_Arnold89,Its my fault a customer doesn't understand the concept of time,"For some background I currently work in a jewelry store that is most known for its swan logo. A customer comes in and requests to put a certain necklace on hold. I inform her I can only put it on hold for 48 hours and that at the end of the day on March 24 the item will put back out and no longer on hold. She agrees, thanks me, and leaves. Fast-forward to April 3, she comes back and the conversation is as follows, she'll be C and I'll be Me.

&amp;#x200B;

C: Hello there! Do you remember me? You put that necklace on hold for me

Me: Yes! I remember you, unfortunately that was the last necklace of that style we had in stock and someone bought it yesterday. I can take your information and order one for you but as I said before it can take up to 4-6 weeks. If you'd like to walk around the store I can help you find something else you like.

C: What?! I SPECIFICALLY told you to hold it for me!!

Me: Yes, and I did. But as I previously informed you we can only hold items for 48 hours and at the end of the day on March 24 the item was put back out.

C: WHY!? Its MY ITEM!

Me: Ma'am, you never paid for the item so it isn't your property. At the end of the hold period it was put back out. Would you like me to order another one for you? I just need your name and a way to contact you once it arrives.

C: No! Its mine! Why did you put it back out? I came right back!

Me: The last day of the hold was March 24, its now April 3. Our policy is to only hold items for 48 hours. Would you like to take a look around and perhaps find something else you like?

C: I came RIGHT BACK! Where is it?! Let me talk to your manager! 

\~At this point she screams at the manager for half an hour, she insists she came right back even though its been well over a week. She demands to be given compensation for the necklace and swiftly gets put in her place by the manager.\~

C: FINE. Since no one here plans to honour an agreement with a customer I'll never be shopping here again!

Me: \*under my breath\* You never shopped here in the first place.

NecroticRamen,That time I returned a bottle of tiki juice five months older than I was.,"This is an amusing story I remembered recently about when I'd just gotten my first job as a cashier and was still new. Now I should mention, we have an outdated system. You can't just search something up on your register, you have to have someone go look.

So I have this woman come in with a big bottle of ""tiki juice."" This is oil that you use to light outdoor wicks and stuff, so it is in the candles department, but we rarely have people work in there. Since this lady has no receipt, I have to have someone check for it, but the person in the next department didn't want to walk 20 feet over and check, so they just told me we still did; so I go ahead and do a no receipt return.

About ten minutes later, my manager comes back from break and checks this out. As they're trying to figure out where they return it, they check the tag. It turns out the date was January 05, 2001. This is slightly over five months older than I was at the time. I'm never going to live down that embarrassment, but whenever we have new employees who are worried about returns, I reassure them that they can't fuck up any worse than returning a seventeen year old bottle of tiki juice that we no longer carry.",TalesFromRetail,1326,1554689078
OsoDePaulie,That’s False Advertising,"Hey everybody, I’m back again. I work for a grocery company, and every Friday, we have Friday-only sales. This last week, we had 24-packs of our brand water 3 for $5. We had sold a ton of them, and corporate realized just how much money we were losing on them, so they told us “no rain checks, no substitutions”.  
Now that we have context, this story happened yesterday, on Saturday.  
  
I get told there’s a customer on hold that wants to speak to a manager, and being the manager on duty yesterday, I slide into the office and take the call. I’m “me”, water lady is “WL”.  
  
&gt;Me: thank you for calling _______, this is osodepaulie, how may I help you? 
WL: Hello, yes. I’m sitting here, looking at your ad. I have a question about something, may I speak to a manager?  
Me: That would be me. What’s your question?  
WL: Oh, good. Well, I see that yesterday you had a sale on your cases of water. I wasn’t able to make it in to get some. Is there a chance I can come in today and you could honor the price?  
Me: I’m sorry ma’am, but I’m not able to do that.  
WL: Why not?  
Me: Well, if you’ll take a look at the ad, it says the water was a Friday-only sale. It’s now Saturday, so, policy states I can’t honor it.  
WL: Well, can’t you just write me a rain check?  
Me: No ma’am, unfortunately l, I can’t do that either.  
WL: WHY NOT?!?  
Me: Well, first off, if we were to write a rain check, it would’ve had to have been done on Friday. However, we usually don’t write rain checks for the Friday-only sales as they are one day only, “while supplies last” deals.  
WL: Well, that’s false advertising.  
Me: It’s false advertising? How so?  
WL: because I didn’t get an opportunity to buy the water on Friday and now you won’t honor the price.  
Me: Well... that’s not really false advertising. It was a one day only sale. You didn’t come in, so I can’t really do anything about that.  
WL: This is outrageous! I want to speak to a manager!  
Me: I am a manager....  
WL: Well, I want to speak to the manager in charge!  
Me: That would also be me....  
WL: Well, um... you know what, F*%# you! I’m going to call corporate. This is unbelievable! What kind of customer service is this that you won’t honor a sale just because I didn’t come in on the day of the sale!?!

EstebanWinsless,"One man, three buns","

A little bit of info before we begin: I work at a small bakery inside of a supermarket. Every morning we get freshly baked bread, buns and cakes delivered from a nearby supermarket(because we don't actually have a baking facility to make stuff), and sometimes we encounter issues with the deliveries. Usually if a customer is unhappy with the quality of the bread or cakes, we call and complain to the supermarket that produced it, and afterwards we figure out a solution/compensation for the customer. I've worked here for about a year now, and I've already racked up loads of amazing stories. This is; 

Tales from the bakery: One man, three buns 


Okay, so; Today I was working a morning shift with another coworker. Our shift starts at 6:30 AM, and we have exactly half an hour to get all the delivered items from the warehouse(in the basement), move them upstairs to the bakery, put up every single item for display and prepare the checkout registers. This all goes pretty smooth, and at 7:00 AM the first few customers start moving in. At this point in the morning we get maybe one or two customers every five minutes. Very chill.

At one point a man comes up to the counter and asks for three buns. We have loads of different buns, but the man requests a specific type which is basically super soft white bread with a crunchy outside. My coworker gets him the buns and he pays before leaving. At this point in the morning we hardly sell anything but buns, so a customer like that won't be anything out of the ordinary.

Around 30 minutes pass, and we are starting to get more and more customers. As I'm talking to a customer, I hear my name being yelled from the customer service desk located right next to the bakery. I finish with my customer, walk over to the desk and I ask what's up? ""Somebody's on the phone. They want to speak with you."", says the customer service. At this point I am preparing to put on my best customer service voice, even though I've only been awake for just about an hour. I pick up the phone and start talking;

""(Supermarket name)'s Bakery-department, Anon speaking. How can I help you?"". A couple seconds pass before I finally hear ""Yeah is this the damn bakery department?"". I reply, telling him that yes this is indeed the bakery. At this point in time his tone goes from that of somebody asking a question, to the tone of someone who is very angry.

""Do you idiots even bake your bread? Why the f*** did you guys sell me raw bread. It's not like it's supposed to be."". I, slightly confused by the situation tells him that of course our bread is freshly baked.

""Listen up punk: I'm standing here in my living room with three f****** buns, and they're all f****** soft as s***."". Because of the fact that it was my coworker who sold him the buns, I have no idea who this guy is, and I have no idea what he is talking about. I enter investigation mode and start asking him a few questions.

""Sir, what kind of buns did you order?"", I ask. - ""I ordered the (name of the bun)."". At this point I realize that he is talking about a bun that is supposed to be super soft and fluffy on the inside, and slightly crunchy on the outside. I reply;

""Sir, that specific bun is supposed to be soft. That's not a mist-"" I don't get a chance to finish my sentence before he cuts in; ""DO YOU THINK I AM STUPID? I KNOW HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE, BUT THE OUTSIDE PART IS NOT CRUNCHY YOU LITTLE DIPS***.""

I take a few breaths and attempt to come up with a solution. ""Sir, if you return to the store with the buns, we will-"" I am again interrupted. ""IT'S NOT CRUNCHY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!"". I try again, ""Sir, if you can just come down her-"". ""SO YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?! OKAY THEN DIPS***, YOU LISTEN FOR YOURSELF!"".

At this point I give my final attempts to de-escalate the situation, meanwhile the man starts yelling ""IT'S NOT CRUNCHY."" over and over again. I am just about to hang up when all out of a sudden the yelling turns into a very muffled ""ł₮'₴ ₦Ø₮ ₵ⱤɄ₦₵ⱧɎ"". The audio turns very scratchy and after around 30 seconds of muffled yelling and complaining I decide to hang up.

Around 10 minutes pass before I am again called up to the customer support desk. I ask again what's up and the customer service representative looks at me strangely and says ""This guy says you broke his phone."". I immediately assume that this must be a joke. How could I have broken someones phone? I have been at work for the past 2 hours. I haven't even used my phone since I arrived. I pick up the phone, and I hear the same familiar screaming, however this time it's not muffled anymore. I spend the next four minutes listening to screams while slowly putting the pieces together in my head. And once it hit me, I. fucking. lost. it.

TURNS OUT; the guy got so angry because he thought that I didn't believe him. So he pulled one of the buns apart and literally smashed his phone into the bun, hoping I would be able to hear that ""It's not crunchy."". Since the bread inside is so soft and fluffy, it got all into his microphone, which explains the muffled screaming. He was now using a landline to call back to the store.

The guy demanded that I paid for the repair of his ""broken"" phone, but I passed the call over to a superviser(mostly because I was having a lot of trouble holding in my laughter.) and she told him that it was his own fault and I was not to blame. He was then asked not to call again after he continued to shout at her.

​

TL;DR i managed to piss off an already pissed off customer to the point of him taking apart a bun and shoving it inside of his phone microphone before calling me on a landline to demand money for the repair of his phone.

BakingGiraffeBakes,Apparently being a nice customer is rare?,"At a large bulk store this afternoon (we’ll call it “Ham’s club”), and my MIL and I were looking for clothes for my kids. We couldn’t find something we wanted in the right size, and asked one of the employees if there was anywhere else it could be.

She said “There’s another table up by the entrance, but if it’s not there, we don’t have it, I’m sorry.”

To which I replied “I already checked there, thank you. And it’s not like you’re purposefully hiding it from me.”

tnick123,You Discriminated against a pregnant woman!,"Hello! I am new to this and this is my first post ever! Sorry about formatting and such.

&amp;#x200B;

Some General info: I work at a grocery store and am a lower end manager. I have power over general workers but most other managers have power over me. I know how to talk to people and am complimented a lot on my customer service skills, Not trying to brag, its just one of the better things I bring to the store.  


Cast is E for Employee, P For person on the phone, and Me being me!!  


I'm helping my current checker (Person working the register) By taking some of their customers over to a separate register as it was particular busy. I'm working as fast as I can as I need to close some registers down as I normally do around this time but can't close them if there are more than 3 people waiting as company policy is ""3's a crowd"". If there is 3 or more, you open up, end of story. Now I just finish helping the last person in my line when I notice on the belt there is like... 5 things just sitting there. When that happens it means someone put there stuff down and forgot something, so they ran off to get what they forgot. Since I was basically brown nosing the customer, trying to make them laugh, feel welcomed, the usual to get them to come back, I never saw the person who put the things down. Now Im in a rush, I need to get stuff done so there isn't leftover work at the end of the shift. I look around and wait for 15 ish seconds. If the customer had said they forgot something or just gave me a face to work with I would have stayed longer for them. But since I had nothing, I simply gave up and walked to the register I was closing figuring ""Hey they will just call me over when they get back, its what other customers do""  


Fast forward about 15 minutes later, Ive forgotten about them at this point as Working in retail you sorta get an auto pilot when your just doing the usual work. We get a phone call so I stop working on my register (Closing it, no customers being helped by me, Just by E who isn't currently overloaded) And go answer it. I give them my Usual Greeting that I've said many many times.   


Me:"" Hello! Thank you for calling GenericGrocerys! My name is Tnick123. How can I help you?""

P: ""Hello Tnick123 I'd like to talk to a manager?""

Me:"" Oh No problem, I'm a manager how can I help?""  
P: ""Oh are you a head clerk? I want to speak to a head clerk?""

Me:"" No sorry, But the head clerk is on lunch and I'm the one in charge till they get back.""

P: ""Alright, Well I have my friend here and she is balling her eyes out cause one of your checkers decided to not help her cause shes pregnant!""  
Me: Slightly taken by surprise by how severe this was. ""Really? Who was it?"" I'd need to know for obvious reasons.

P: ""I don't know but she had only a few items and had to leave to grab something she forgot, Then they refused to help her!""

Me: realized what had happened ""Oh I think I know what had happened, That was me at the register, I never saw her and was in a hurry. She never tried to get my attention, If she had I would have ran over to help! I promise you there was no malice behind it. I just didn't know who put those items there and couldn't see anyone rushing to or away from my check stand. If I had I would have waited cause there would have been a face I could watch for. Im really sorry if it came off as such""  


At this point I'm rather upset, I pride myself in my customer service and didn't like upsetting random Customers for no good reason.

&amp;#x200B;

P: ""No, You did it cause she was pregnant and discriminated against her! So here is whats going to happen. Im going to come down there and your going to refund the items and your gonna let us have them or else Im going to call corporate.""   


Me: Hearing her make these demands so suddenly out of the blue made me furrow my brown and frown. ""Sorry, But I know what happened, I'm not just going to give you stuff for free cause you feel it was somehow personal. I'll gladly give you a refund but your not getting anything for free""

&amp;#x200B;

P: ""Let me talk to the E!"" (The receipts have our names on them in case you needed to call in a compliment or complaint, Or if something was left behind we can ask the person at the register.)

&amp;#x200B;

I shrug and agree, Letting E out of the register and giving her a basic Idea of what was going on and start to work on her line of customers while she talks on the phone. Soon she hangs the phone up and lets me out. 

Me: ""So what happened?""  
E: ""She said shes going to come down here soon, But I know who the customer was and she looked fine while she was in my line.""  


I just shrug and go back to work. Figuring she was gonna come by in a bit when my manager came back from lunch. When my manager did come back I gave them the gist of what was going on.

She never showed up.

unaumbra,Do Not get gas unless it is here ever again!,"So let me explain I work at a store that also runs a gas station, and my store recently underwent a renovation where they built a gas station on property. Well for years I always went to a small mom, and pop gas station/convenience store. The kind where in this small town I live in now they allow locals that frequent to run a tab provided they pay which I do, and is convenient between paydays sometimes. 

Today I was on my way to work, and stopped by mom, and pops store to get some gas, and buy a cold soda before work. I was wearing my work uniform of course as I was on my way into work. A woman behind me in line was just acting huffy, and impatient as I waited ahead of her to pay for my drink, and gas. She asked me what I was doing there, and I told her getting something to drink, and gas. She in a nasty tone of voice said I should not be buying gas here since my work had a gas station. Mind you my work had gas cheaper, but only 2 cents cheaper, and I frequented this place before the gas station was built. I told her I supported local businesses, and that the couple who owned the mom, and pop were friendly, and I wanted to support there business too.

   She stopped talking as I paid for gas, and drink. I went to work, and a few hours later I got called to the office. The manager asked me if I had gone to mom, and pop this morning, and I told him I did. He asked me why. I told him it was habit, and I liked the owners. He sternly told me that as I was an employee of store which had a gas station I was not to go there again, and if I needed gas that I was to only purchase it from store. I asked him if he was joking. He told me no, and that he was glad crazy lady told him I was there. I asked him if he thinks he might want to rethink what he was saying. He told me no that if I were caught going there again he would terminate me. 

   Well I do not know what he was thinking as I stood up, and opened the door to his office. I went immediately to our HR representative in the store, and asked her company policy on employees going to gas stations. She told me there was no such policy, and asked why. I asked her to come to the manager with me, and she followed. I asked him with her standing there what he would do if I went to mom, and pop again. He said I would be terminated for it since we had our own gas station. The HR reps eyes nearly popped out as he said that. I said alright I think she understands now, and walked out. 

  As I was clocking out the HR rep caught me, and asked to talk to me in private. She told me she needed me to fill out some paper work to record the incident earlier. I obliged basically a statement of what was said, and an official management ethics complaint form. All in a envelope along with her statement that she witnessed the manager aggressively threatening employees to purchase products from the company or be terminated. My company had just settled out of court to many managers acting unethically in some ways, and are in the zero tolerance position for unethical behaviors so as I filled out the paper work, and signed the forms I know that the manager will not be long for our company.

TheMentalPanda,Apparently I have terrible language,"Hey guys and welcome to another installment of tales from the hardware store. In this one I apparently have a terribly foul mouth.

So the store I worked at sometimes had ""VAT free Sundays"", which were days where everything was 25% off (with exceptions of course) and as you can imagine, those days were quite busy.   
So I'm working a usual customer service shift, trying to help 5 people at a time, while having to dance around 2-4 people behind my desk because my coworker for some reason prefer to use the customer service computer instead of their own department's. 

One such coworker is now standing and talking with a customer, half covering the computer, but not using, and since I need it, I ask him to move. Usually when I want people to move, I say something that's roughly translated to ""please move your pretty butt"", but it was busy, I was stressed and I might just have said something along the lines of, ""your butt's in the way.""

My coworker jokingly tells me that it wasn't very polite, because I'm usually really polite with people. His customer then chimes in with her agreement that it was very rude of me. Me, being already focused on what I had to do for my customer, either just say ""ok"" or give some sort of half-apology (I figured if it really annoyed my coworker, then we could talk about it later when we weren't swamped). The customer sees this as an opportunity to start a tirade about how rude I am and how customers shouldn't be hearing such terrible language and she wanted my name because she was definitely sending a complaint about this, because it just completely *unacceptable.* I can't remember the complete wording, because I was more focused on figuring out how to help my own customers than listening to a whole speech about how I'm the devil incarnate for not saying please, but I give some nods and some 'ok's in her direction, which might not have helped my case, but c'mon.

She ended up getting my name (I wear a nametag), she got the help she needed from my coworker, I figured out how to help my customer, and I never heard anything from corporate.",TalesFromRetail,697,1554486340
MrsDwightShrute,"""So you're going to go dumpster diving then?"" -customer my husband dealt with today.","My husband works in cell phones. He's a manager. 

They had a customer come in and buy a new phone and had one of those phone cases with a wallet built in to the back where he kept his driver's license/credit cards,etc. 

A day after he leaves he calls and tells my husband he can't find his phone case with his info and needs them to look for it.

My husband asked his employee who worked with him if she had seen it. She said she distinctly remembered putting it in the bag with his other things. 

Husband tells customer this and this what happened. C-customer H-husband 

C: well your employee is WRONG. Because it's not here! It must have gotten thrown away! 

H: we have a very loyal cleaning crew who empties the trash every night sir. They would have seen it, if it had. 

C: THERES JUST NO WAY! It has to be there! It can literally not be anywhere else. 

H: well we have the dumpsters out back so if it was in the trash that is where it would be. 

C: So how long will it take you to dig in the dumpster to find it?

H:...... You want me to dumpster dive for a phone case that wasn't thrown away?

C: YES! THIS IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. 

H: We share a dumpster with 3 food establishments and one hair salon. I will not be taking any of my time to dig through that. You can feel free. You know where we're located. 

The customer told him to fuck off and that he was a disgrace to his company. 
My husband laughed and told him that he hoped the rest of his day was as pleasant as he was.

GeodesicDragon,Only a kid would think like this...,"I'm a first time poster, so please be gentle.

I'm a volunteer at a charity shop, and I spend a lot of my time at the front with the customers. This means that I see a lot of people, and come across all sorts.

During a quiet period, a young boy - probably 6 or 7 years old - came into the shop, accompanied by a woman whom I assumed was his grandmother. They looked around for a while before coming up to the counter, where we have a small display of 'Knitted Chicks.' These chicks are, as the name suggest, knitted chicks in a variety of colours; the bonus is that they contain a chocolate egg as a treat.

The boy sees them, and then the following conversation takes place:

&amp;#x200B;

Boy: I like the look of these.

Woman: Oh, they're pretty; look, there's even an egg inside.

Boy: I think I'll get one. *(addressing me)* How do I get the egg out?

*(I pick up one of the chicks.)*

Me: You cut along this thread here; it's separate from the rest of the chick, so it won't unravel.

(The boy is silent for a moment.)

Boy: I've changed my mind about getting one.

Woman: Why's that?

Boy: Well... I don't want to kill the chick to get the egg.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I had to stop myself from bursting out laughing - professional demeanour and all that - while the woman attempts to convince the boy that the chick 'will be all right.' He's not convinced, and they both leave without purchasing anything. As soon as they were out of sight, I laughed so hard I had a coughing fit.

Anyway, that's my first post; a bit tame compared to some of the other stuff I've seen, but it got a laugh out of me and the Manager (when I told her about it), so I thought I'd share it here.

I've got other stories as well, so perhaps I'll share them at some point in the future.",TalesFromRetail,1932,1554394539
rb2m,“It’s white”,"Long-time lurker, first time poster, on mobile. 

This got longer than I anticipated. 

I sell and repair sewing machines for a living. A customer picked up their repaired sewing machine, no issues. 

Then I get a call later in the day that they got the wrong machine. Ok, no problem, it’s rare, but mistakes happen. Told them to bring the machine back and we’d get everything straightened out. 

Now, when we check a machine in, we take the make, model and serial number for such issues as this. The customer also has to sign a printed receipt authorizing us to do the work, and on that paper is the make, model, and serial number.  This is very important. 

(Note: customer was older)

Customer comes back in with the machine and I pull up their work order in our system, check the model and serial number against what’s listed and THEY MATCH. 

Customer is still adamant that they got the wrong machine, so I go get my boss. They also verify everything. Customer still adamant. Luckily, the original, SIGNED, receipt we tag on the machine was just in the recycling bin, so we pull it out, show the customer the matching make, model, and serial number, but they are STILL adamant it’s not their machine. 

My boss asks if the customer can at least tell us what the make of their machine is so we have somewhere to start if by some huge mistake we put the wrong machine info on their tag that they signed. This is verbatim as I can still remember it years later: “I don’t know, but it’s white.” 

For those unfamiliar with sewing machines, most of them are covered in white plastic. Older ones and newer, cheap-ish ones can be different colors. 

So my boss asks if the customer can remember any features on the machine. They claim the whole thing is white, (no decals, screens, nothing) whereas this machine had an electronic screen and the make and model at the bottom. (Note: every machine at least has the make on the front and most have the model as well)

We go through this routine for several minutes, the customer getting more and more angry by the minute and my boss keeping a cool head (they’re pretty good at that.) We ask for the customer to bring in proof of what their machine actually is, but they don’t think they have any of the records. 

FINALLY, the customer gives up, takes the machine and leaves, threatening to call the Better Business Bureau on us. 

You’d think the story would end there, right?  Wrong. 

My boss gets a call a couple weeks later from a local TV station looking to do a story. Apparently the customer had called them to complain. My boss tells him the whole story and the TV station guy agrees, they probably won’t pursue this, but the customer is still furious. 

In total, my boss got a call from another TV station and radio station, and a newspaper I believe, gave them the same info, and all agreed, they wouldn’t be pursuing it any further. 

Also note: the machine the customer received, (their machine) wasn’t a cheap machine. It was a good quality, expensive machine. ",TalesFromRetail,1427,1554340606
sunnykl,12 Items or Less,"As promised in my last post, the story of Roid Rager from the early 90s. Strap in or head for the tl;dr

RR: Roid Rager. You know the type. Huge. Twitchy. Lived in the gym. 

GF: Roid Rager's trashy girlfriend who still had an 80s perm.

OP: Teenage grocery store cashier.

AM: Middle-aged manager who had handled many a Florida Man.

Unfortunately I was on the express lane that day. We'd gotten word blasted down from national that secret shoppers reported people in the express lane with big orders. It was a valid complaint. They weren't putting enough cashiers on due to a cost cutting measure instituted by the regional director, so lines were ridiculous. We'd been taking them on express when it was empty. Regardless, now we had strict instructions no more than 20 items in the 12 or less lane. It could get you written up and hurt your raises or even result in termination if you got 3 inside some time period I forget.

The cashiers were responsible for keeping the register candy and magazines stocked and neat. Also the front of store displays between the last register and produce. Those were the weekly big sale items and this giant cardboard Kool-Aid monstrosity of doom that contained thousands of packets of heavily dyed citric acid and artificial flavor. Many a kid trashed that thing. It was the bane of our existence. So was the nightly fronting of the baby food aisle, but that's not relevant to this story. I just like to whine about fronting baby food. Those little jars were evil.

RR, GF and his very full cart hop in my express lane line while an elderly lady is just finishing up her transaction. GF's whining to RR about the wait. She wants to go somewhere else. This is boring. He started telling her to shut up. They got into a mild spat instead of putting things on the belt, so I let them be to finish the elderly lady's transaction.

When I was with her, RR snapped at his GF something about how they're checking out now and to stop being a bitch. 

As kindly as possible, I pointed out the 12 items or less sign and explained I wasn't permitted to check out anybody with more than a few over. Manager's orders. There were lanes open down the way. 

RR leaned over the counter at me, informed me loudly that he didn't have time to wait and listen to GF bitch, and I would be checking him out immediately or else. I hit my panic button and flipped on my register light. That automatically called the police and set off silent alarms in all the back areas of the store.

He started slamming down his things on the belt as I attempted to explain that I had called a manager, but I could not ring up his things without approval. I could literally get fired for it. There had been complaints. That's when RR started to really lose it. Informed me quite loudly that he had a complaint too. Was his complaint less important than anybody else's? This went on with my parentage being called into question and stuff slamming on the counter so hard a couple things even opened. 

AM arrived running up from the back where he'd been dealing with a delivery issue. AM was not a small man, but RR was freaking huge. AM told me to go in his office (up half a level with half-walls where you can see all the registers easy), he'd handle this. I fled. RR did not take that well. RR demanded that the c-word ring him up, not some pencil neck suit.

My manager was quite firm that nobody would be ringing him up, and asked him to leave. RR lost it completely and started swearing, arm waving and knocking magazines off the display. The GF did not even cower at this like you'd think. She started whining about how long they'd already been there and how she didn't want to do it all again. RR yelled something about being done with all this, then he gave the still mostly-full cart a mighty shove. It went careening down towards produce and straight into the giant Kool-Aid display knocking the entire thing over and scattering hundreds of packets of kool-aid across all of produce.

RR physically dragged GF out by the arm, and we never saw them again. About fifteen minutes later the cops showed up. Nice job on that panic button, guys. They took our reports and security footage, but nobody knew his name or anything useful. The parking lot cameras had bad coverage and hadn't seen anything helpful either.

That was the one and only time I ever cried at work. It was terrifying. I was also closing. That display was my job to fix before I clocked out for the night. AM helped me as did most of the rest of the staff once they were done with their areas, but it was a good hour and a half putting back together the cardboard display (which was a dented mess) and sorting hundreds and hundreds of kool-aid packets back into their correct slots. Then I still had to front the baby food (they helped with that too).

By the next week AM had told the district manager to pound sand and started putting enough cashiers on shifts. 

tl;dr: Steroid-infused gym rat flips out at being told he can't take a full cart through the express lane and hurls his cart into a giant display of Kool-Aid packets. OP had to fix it.",TalesFromRetail,1850,1554296717
PandaShock,"""Y'all can't judge me. Only GOD can judge me""","I found this sub not too long ago, so I thought i'd just share a story before i forget the whole thing.

I'm a bagger at a chain grocery store, so I don't experience rude customers like cashiers and customer service representatives do. Not to mention that this particular store is rather small compared to others of the same name. 

Anyways, one day i'm just bagging one customers groceries like i'm supposed to do, until this lady walked into the store shouting something like ""I don't care what any of y'all think, only god can judge me. Ain't nobody gonna tell Ms. Johnson what to do"". No idea what the ladies problem was, but apparently only god can judge her, so whatever. Other customers look visibly confused, as well as some of my coworkers. She walks towards the other entrance of the store where we keep electric carts for customers who have trouble walking and such. She gets in one and starts driving it around, despite their being no visible problems with her walk. Unfortunately for her (and eventually our ears) the cart had low battery and died on her. Upset that the cart isn't working, she starts shouting again about ""I ain't here to play no games"" or something. She got up from the cart and walked around the store shouting her signature phrase ""Only god can judge me"" while disappearing into the aisles. And that was the last disturbance she made. Or so we thought, as she came back around to the front with no groceries in hand, and went to the customer service desk. I didn't quite hear or remember what they were talking about at customer service, but I remember hearing the lady say ""I don't wanna play any games. If I wanted to play games, i'd play with my son"". And then she'd go up to an old guy in a working electric cart, and ask for the cart he's sitting in. The people around him look like they're going to fight the lady, but he stops them and gives the lady the cart. Old dude had a limp too. Lady get's in the cart, starts driving around the store again saying ""I don't care what any of y'all say, only god can judge me"". After that whole experience one customer just said ""What the hell was that about?""",TalesFromRetail,784,1554257150
Daddy-kinkshame-me,"Yes I speak Spanish too, pendeja.","So this is one of my all time favorite stories to tell about my work in retail so far.

So a little info on me, I'm very pale, i don't look very Hispanic. In fact my name isnt very hispanic either (so i've been told). So people usually think I'm white until I pull out my fluent Spanish.

One slow afternoon i get a lady and her 7 year old son come into my line. She speaks to me in English and i can hear her accent but i have a hard time deciding where her accent is from. Since she seems pretty fluent and has no problem understanding me i continue to speak with her in English. I notice that her son is browsing through one of the magazines we sell and i wait to see if she'll say anything to him.

We finish the transaction, I give her her bag, watch her start baghing her items and she has yet to mention the magazine. So i ask her ""ma'am, will you be buying the magazine?""

She looks at it and rippes it out of her kids hands, and I'm thinking 'ah crap she's gonna yell at the kid for grabbing something he shouldn't have' but instead she says, ""ay si, como si fuera a robarme este pinche revista de 3 dollares. Pendeja."" Which was Spanish for ""oh wow im totally gonna steal this stupid 3 dollar magazine. Dumbass.""

She tosses it to me and i say, in my sweetest voice, ""bueno, la revista cuesta $13.99..."" Which was spanish for ""well, the magazine costs $13.99...""

She looks at me and goes ""ooh no pues wow, hablas Español. Babosa"" which was ""oh wow, you speak Spanish. Idiot."" And i say ""Parese que si. Que tenga un lindo dia."" Which was ""looks like i do. Have a nice day."" She told me to go fuck myself and left the store.

JustanOldBabyBoomer,Having a Sense of Humor With Shoplifters.,"I'm typing on a tablet that tends to glitch and crash so I may have to post and edit in the middle.  Thanks for your patience.

Many years ago, I used to work in a dime store that is now long gone.  One of our frequent challenges was dealing with shoplifters.

I was working the cash register when an employee came out of the stockroom to give me the heads up about spotting shoplifters.  What these shoplifters were doing was stuffing merchandise inside other merchandise, which is a NO-NO.  Their goal was to get away with stealing whatever they could without getting caught.

Anyway, the shoplifters came to my register, plunked their basket down, and pointedly told me NOT to touch it!  (Yeah!  RIGHT!)  Then the shoplifters went elsewhere to where I couldn't see them but a co-worker could observe any more shoplifting attempts without being spotted.  While the shoplifters were busy elsewhere, I went ahead and pulled everything out of their basket and pulled out ALL the merchandise they were planning on stealing.  I stacked their planned purchases very neatly and arranged what they planned to steal right on top!  Then I sat back and waited while my supervisor hid and watched the fun.

The shoplifters came back and started to comment about some other merchandise but stopped in mid-sentence when they realized their game was up!  All they could do was stand in front of me imitating a goldfish!  I asked, ""Is there a problem?""  I heard my supervisor giggling like mad and the shoplifters turn all shades of red!

It was FUN to watch!  :-) ",TalesFromRetail,1722,1554035949
cduerksie,Camouflage Does It’s Job (Customer Can’t Find Her Own Shirt - Blames Us),"I work at a women’s clothing store in an area with a high percentage of wealthy suburban mom types. Yesterday we had a pair of ladies in the store who weren’t the nicest, but they weren’t being outwardly mean either. I could overhear them trash talking the clothes in the fitting room, but you know, to each their own right? 

Anyways, a little context, our fitting room is at the back of the store and we take all the unprocessed clothes out to a rack and two bins by the cash wrap to process. The whole store is organized by type of clothes (yoga, swim, running, travel, etc) and everything is sorted into neat and organized piles. We keep it very clean and organized during the day.

So all of a sudden the employee working the fitting room comes out to me at the processing rack and says “have you seen a camo shirt accidentally come through? One of our customers can’t find the shirt she wore in.” Now I haven’t seen it, and also it’s a slow as heck day and I have maybe 20 items of clothing in my bin so there’s not much to check. Nope, not there. Out comes Camo Lady (CL). 

CL: [announcing to the whole store] Has ANYONE seen my camo shirt?!?

I ask her politely if she’s checked her fitting room, her purse, and her other shopping bag. She insists that “of course” she’s already checked there and we “must have done something” with her shirt. She’s now instructing us to look under all our tables and triple check the processing area. 

CL: “I have somewhere to be this is ridiculous.”

We’re all running around looking for her shirt, but it’s nowhere to be found. I offer to take her phone number so she can get to her important place and we can call her if it turns up later. She’s now adamantly insisting that we have placed her (very worn and not our brand) camo shirt on a rack somewhere with our bathing suits or athletic clothes. Finally I convince her to give me her phone number and she leaves in a huff. 

Fast forward about 20-30 minutes, and I find her camo shirt in her fitting room, wadded up in a ball on the floor. We give her a call - no answer, full inbox. An hour later she calls us and my manager (M) that was on break when all this went down answers the call. 

M: Yeah we found your shirt! It was in the fitting room. 

CL: Well THATS IMPOSSIBLE. I looked there. I need you to ship it to me. 

M: Well, we can’t ship your own shirt to you but we can hold onto it here for you as long as you need so you can pick it up. 

At this point CL was so angry that she refused to speak. My manager sat on the phone in silence with her for a bit before going “hello? Hello?” And hanging up. She still hasn’t called back. 

Also, she didn’t buy anything at the store. Of course. 

TL;DR Lady drops her camo shirt in her fitting room, doesn’t see it, and insists we purposely lost it. Later on after she leaves and we find the shirt she insists that we pay shipping to send it to her so she doesn’t have to come back and get it. ",TalesFromRetail,1496,1553961539
IdiotaRandoma,"Yes, lady, we're definitely committing attempted murder to get you to come back.","These days I work at [REDACTED] in the ""Auto Care Center."" The other night I was working a normal shift on an otherwise normal day. A customer had come through and gotten a tire replaced; I didn't know the full situation at the time, but it was apparently covered under the road hazard warranty and as such she got a free tire. Fairly normal stuff.

A few hours later, I'm straightening my aisles while the guys in the shop are wrapping up the last few vehicles out in the bay. I get a call on my phone from the manager's office needing to speak with one of the shop techs. After I get one and he takes the call, he informs me of what went down. The lady from earlier had just gotten her third tire under the road hazard warranty; the previous two tires replaced both had non-repairable sidewall damage in the same spot on the car, so they were replaced free of charge. The service manager had spitballed some ideas on what could be happening to cause this to happen, throwing off ideas like ""Maybe you've hit the same thing in the road more than once?"" or ""Maybe someone could be trying to slash your tires?"" I don't know how plausible those were, but clearly something is causing this very specific damage to keep happening to the same tire in the same spot.

The lady, upon hearing that second idea, goes home and calls management to insinuate that maybe one of our shop techs is slashing her tires to drum up more business! I immediately busted out laughing like a madman and nearly fell over behind the counter at the absolute stupidity of such a statement. I could just say she's overly paranoid if her half-brained idea made any sense at all, but she got two **FREE** tires!

AnotherLazynpc,“Next time tell that b***ard to put it in my hair!”,"I used to work at a gas station a few years ago, so obviously we got a lot of questionable people coming in on a regular basis. But there was this one woman who we just called crazy lady (Mean, I know but it was a well deserved nickname.) that takes the gold for craziest customer I have ever seen. This isn’t the most insane story involving her, but it’s my favorite to tell.

So my shift had just ended and I was buying a few things while chatting with a coworker, I’ll call him Steve. While he was ringing me up crazy lady bursts through the door, slams $4 down on the counter and rudely tells him to put it on the pump she was at. We were kind of used to her at this point so we just roll our eyes, Steve suspends my transaction so he can put the money on her pump then goes back to ringing me out.

I had just swiped my card when we see crazy lady rushing back to the store. We share an “Oh god what now?” Look. She looked extremely upset as she once again slams the door open and says “I gave you $4!” 

Steve and I share a confused look and he looks down at the monitor (Where it shows the pumps in use, and the amount being pumped.) before he replies with “Yes ma’am, I put that on your pump.” 

Crazy lady snaps back with “No you didn’t! It only said $1.67! I gave you $4 not $1.67!”

Now, our pumps had a habit of freezing from time to time while fuel was being pumped, but it was never for more than a couple of seconds, so I can only assume that her pump froze and she took it as being done without actually waiting to see if it was. Steve again looked down at the monitor to see that all $4 had indeed been pumped. He explains to her that sometimes our pumps froze up and if she went back outside, she would see that all $4 had been pumped. 

She replies with “It f***king better be!”. She started to turn around when something on the counter catches her eye, she adds (Still extremely aggressively) “Did you guys get my application?” Again, we have no idea what she’s talking about. 

Steve asks her “what application?” And she gets even more upset 

“For the credit card!” She screams, pointing to the fuel rewards cards we kept on the counter for customers. “I put in an application and nobody ever got back to me!”

In order to activate your rewards card you have to register it online. But it’s just a rewards card that saves you money on gas and other items in the store if you come in a lot, not a credit card. Steve explains as much and says that her rewards card should be good to go if she registered it online.

Crazy lady huffs, rolls her eyes and snaps “I guess I’ll need another one of THESE then!” Snatching a card from the counter. She takes two steps out the door before she whirls around, pushes the door back open and screams “And next time tell that ba***rd to put it in my hair!” 

Steve and I just stand there speechless for a few moments wondering what the f**k just happened before we burst out laughing. 

I absolutely hated that job, but having stories like these to share almost made it worth is.

Side note: We saw after she pulled away that the pump she had used was still showing that it was in use, despite it being done pumping. I walked out to see that the nozzle was on the ground, a puddle of gasoline surrounding it. Apparently when she came in to scream at us she had dropped the pump, but left it pumping. So everything after that $1.67 that she saw spilled out onto the ground.",TalesFromRetail,1437,1553838078

Leftover-Verg,Customer assumed age meant seniority,"Our coupon exception policy updated at the beginning of the year. We’ve had plenty of customers argue and insist on speaking to managers because of this.

I was on registers preparing to monitor a new employee. It’s her last day of training, so I just mainly stand there and make sure she’s all good. There’s a bit of a line so I begin to ring while waiting on her. I get a customer who wants a manager because I told her the coupon wouldn’t work. She’s getting louder and louder as I tried to explain the updated policy, but honestly it seemed like she just wanted to yell until she got her way. I asked her to step to register 1, because that’s the only register managers use, while I called the manager up. Our main manager is on a conference call and we’re super busy that day so I tell her it’ll be a wait. I have a new customer step up and he’s just giving me the sympathy look. While I’m checking him out our newest employee comes up to registers. The angry lady beelines over to her and starts complaining. 

Here’s an important detail- I’m in college but have been there over two years but our new employee is semi retired. This meant the customer thought she was in charge. 

I’m finishing with my customer and preparing to go over and explain what’s going on to both of them when the girlfriend (possibly, seemed like it at least) came over and told me that the customer was saying I was only refusing because I was lazy and didn’t want to, and that I shouldn’t work there then.
I handed the man his receipt, looked at the girlfriend, shrugged and said, “She’s newer than me.” The guy burst out laughing and that boosts my mood. 
I finish getting the line down and look over, the lady is being checked out. I head over after their done, since if she wants me fired I’m not going to deal with her, and it’s a good learning opportunity.

Daddy-kinkshame-me,"She didn't remmeber me, but I sure remembered her.","This happened a while ago but I'm writing about it now because i saw the lady that this story revolves around and once again thanked my lucky stars i got promoted to another position.

Back when i was a cashier, I worked really hard to remember all the codes for the produce and other items, especially our store brand water bottle packages (35 count). Our brand, plus another name brand, had short 5 digit codes we could input instead of having to scan the entire package. Unfortunately, every other brang we sold didnt have a code, so we had to scan them.

In comes Cranky Lady (CL) and soon to be Embarrassed Daughter (ED). The lady kinda throws her stuff on the conveyor belt and then zooms by with 2 packages of water bottles that i needed to scan, so i tell her ""ma'am may i scan your water first?"" She's quick to make a fuss about it and starts complaining about how she's ""not stealing, whats the big deal."" I ignore her, which pisses her off. She keeps up bitching and complaining, and i do my best to keep quiet. Eventually her daughter tells her ""mom stop it you're being annoying."" CL says ""oh am I? Sorry, I get cranky when i dont eat."" I quickly finish the transaction and move on.

One week later, I'm on the register again and its slow, so my mind drifts and i remember CL and ED and laugh to myself about the issue wh3n guesd who comes up to my register? If you said CL and ED, you get a gold star.

I kinda stare at her because i can't believe that she's right there when i was just thinking about her. And sure enough, she has 2 packages of water again, this time they're our store brand. I start scanning her items and again she zooms by with the water at the bottom of the cart. 

Me: oh, was that 2 or 3 packages of water?

CL: 2, do you need to scan them?

Me: no its alright i have a code here

CL: oh good youre smart, last week i had a dumbass scan them. She thought i was going to run with them. Pretty stupid of her.

I'm in shock. I can't believe her. I kinda stare at her and her daughter goes ""mom....dont start"" but her mom goes ""what? She was stupid.""

I smile. ""Was it the same brand?"" I ask her. ""Yep. I always get this brand."" She says.

I smile even more, ""really? Because i remember it being [other name brand] and that one doesn't have a code like [the sore brand] does.""

She looks at me and i can *see* her recognize me at last. She stays quite, and i see her daughter die a little inside. I finish quickly, and wish her a nice day, to which she responds ""yeah whatever"".

It honestly brings a smile to my face remembering this.",TalesFromRetail,2933,1553739314
kevlowe,Way to tweet yourself out of a job!,"So I worked on a college campus (you would ~~expect~~ hope people to be more educated, but nope), and we were hiring for our print department.  We went through the numerous applications, did our interviews, and were ready to offer someone the job.  Now, they still have to go through HR, so when we call them to let them know, we make sure to let them know that their employment is not set until they have completed their HR paperwork.

This genius decided to tweet within the hour something along the lines of ""Got a job at the campus print center, free prints for all my n****s!""  Upon being made aware of this tweet by someone who knew her, I immediately called up HR and asked about rescinding the job offer, and since she had not had her appointment yet, it was no problem.

I called her a little bit after that, and it went to voicemail.  I did the standard ""Upon further consideration, we've decided to go in another direction..."", and left it at that.

She never did call back or ask for any further explanation, but it was funny as hell to see a little bit later on her Twitter ""Can a job take back their employment offer?!?""  Oh, I can't tell you how much restraint it took me to not comment, but it was fun to see some of her followers basically telling her she was SOL.

Oh, and just to clear things up, this wasn't a private twitter, this was public, so it's not like I had to go search around for someone who knew her to be able to see it.",TalesFromRetail,681,1553712913
irotsamoht,The restroom is OUT OF ORDER.,"Yesterday our store’s toilet started leaking from around the base. There was a nasty yellow/green liquid coming up through the floor. We put a sign on the door stating it was out of order. We also blocked it off with some boxes and a cart. There were also wet floor signs inside the restroom.

However, some bright person decided they needed to go right now. Despite us having plenty of surrounding stores with working restrooms. 

A woman runs into the restroom, shoving the cart and pushing the boxes. She of course flushes when she’s finished and the liquid begins to leak, covering the entire bathroom floor and sleeping into the stock room. GREAT. 

She then has the nerve to complain that our bathroom has a terrible smell and that she’s stepped in water.

low_myope,"""I am not breaking the law and risking my career for you""","I work in the UK as an Optometrist, and generally tend to work for independent chains. I spend 95% of my time examining patients, so tend not to get involved with the retail side. 

Anyhow, one quiet afternoon, a gentleman walks in (lets call him NM, for nasty man), and starts chatting to the receptionist (lets call her LR, for lovely receptionist). I can hear the interchange from my office:

&gt;NM: I would like to buy a set of glasses please
&gt;LR: Sure thing, are you registered with us?
&gt;NM: No, I have just moved to the area
&gt;LR: Ok, when did you last have your eyes tested?
&gt;NM: About 4 years ago.
&gt;LR: I see, in that case you will need to get your eyes tested as your last prescription will be out of date.
&gt;NM: Now, now, now my lovely. Do not start playing silly fun and games with me here. *said in a very nasty and patronising manner*
&gt;LR: *obviously taken aback* I am sorry sir, but I am not trying to play any games here.
&gt;NM: *starting to speak quite nastily* You are being very unhelpful in response to a simple demand. Now it is very simple, you obviously have the equipment to check the power in my current glasses, just use that ok?
&gt;LR: I'm really sorry sir, but I am not allowed to do that

At this point, I have heard enough and leave my office and come out to reception to intervene. I try to calm down the situation and explain that what he is requesting would be illegal. I offer to give him a (free NHS) test that day. However he point blank refuses and asks me to fabricate the test, and issue him with a new prescription (once again illegal). Once we have gone around in circles for a few minute, we came to the final exchange:

&gt;Me: So let me get this straight, you want me to pretend to examine you, and sell you glasses which are the same power as your old ones?
&gt;NM: *huffs and puffs in triumph* Yes! Thank goodness we have got there in the end!
&gt;Me: So in short, you are requesting that I; fabricate medical data, issue a false prescription, defraud the NHS, and potentially risk my professional registration and career. Is there anything else you would like me to do today?
&gt;NM: *not even a hint of shame* No, that will be fine by me
&gt;Me: I am not breaking the law and risking my career for you. You have been very rude to myself and my colleague here. Please leave the store, and do not return. Your custom is not wanted here. 
&gt;NM: *obviously gob smacked that I stood up to him* Oh, ok. *then subsequently walks out*

I have never experienced anything like this before or afterwards. To put things very simply, all he needed to do was to sit for an exam for 25 minutes, and I could've issued him with a brand new prescription and gladly made him up a set of glasses.

TLDR: Nasty customer asks me to break law, and risk my own career over a set of glasses. ",TalesFromRetail,1324,1553472029

“I just run it near his face. I didn’t use it. I just wanted to know if it worked because I got another one before and it didn’t work. I’m buying this one” *points to a different one in her cart*

vinylleaf,"""I know the guy who owns this place!""","(LONG) Sorry this post is long! 
TL;DR at the bottom. I'm on mobile so I apologize for any typos or wrong auto correct!

I manage a locally owned store where we deal in used goods of the video game variety. Being a small business dealing in used goods, we have certain policies in place for a reason. Most of our customers understand and dont harass us about them but not this guy. We'll call him AC for Annoying Customer.


AC enters our store and walks up to the front counter where my associate and myself are working. We greet AC and he asks how much we pay out for an Xbox One. I explain our store policy which is that we need to see all items in person to give out any quotes. 

Ignoring what I just stated, AC proceeds to tell us about how he really doesn't want to sell it. It's just taking up space and not being used, so he asks for a price range. I again explain to AC how we need to see the item and dont give quotes because there are quite a few things that go into the numbers we give out that we need to see the condition for. I again state that we'd be more than happy to take a look at it if AC just brings it into the store.

AC starts to get upset. He raises his voice a bit and says,  ""Look, I know you can give me a number. It's already in your computer. Just tell me what the screen says for an Xbox One."" I try to explain to him that our system doesn't work that way and that we look everything up manually in real time so I can't give a number without seeing the items in question. AC doesn't let me finish explaining and interrupts asking me to just look it up on Ebay or whatever and give him the lowest we'd offer.

By this time I'm done trying to be nice. I tend to get people trying to get me to be a push over and it really bothers me. So I tell him once more that we have our policies for a reason and everyone is treated the same. 

AC then starts going off about how I'm being rude and denying him a service. Being highly annoyed, I inform him that I have a right to refuse service and that he can just not bring his items in because we will no longer be buying anything from him. AC starts chuckling to himself. AC then says ""Oh man, you really messed up now. You don't even know. I know the guy who owns this place! You're  the manager here, yeah?"" 

I proceed to tell him yes. AC asks for my name and keeps prattling off how he's going to contact them and how I've messed up big time about refusing him a service. I then tell him Ihave the right to refuse service to anyone and that he is no longer welcome in the store and to please leave.

AC has to have one final word in""You wont see me again in this store! Because you  have a job anymore!"" He says as he finally leaves the store. 

I proceeded to send a picture of the guy from our camera footage to the owner; who I know quite well. He tells me he's never met the guy.

darth_ravage,You will not speak about my employees like that!,"Several years back I was working at a big chain grocery store. I had worked my way up from bagger, to cashier, to floor supervisor, then to the customer service desk. Fun fact: They all paid the same. But anyway, we had a number of regulars. Most of them were great, but there was one lady who came in 5-6 days a week and complained about something every single time. And when I say every time, I'm not exaggerating. Policy was that whenever someone saw her walk in, we had to page the manager on duty and let them know so they could be prepared.  

When this story takes place, I had been working at my store for about 5 years and was working the service desk that day. She will be CL for Crazy Lady.  

&gt;CL: (Approaching desk) Call your manager. Now.  

I recognized her and knew there was no point in asking if I could help. So I paged the manager who was already hanging around the area waiting for the call.  

&gt;Manager: How can I help you Ma'am?  
&gt;CL: Your cashier on lane #10 has no idea what she is doing.  

CL then launched into a extremely nitpicky rant of all the ways that cashier #10 was bad at her job. My manager, who had already heard several similar rants from CL that same week, goes to his happy place. His glazed eyes must have told CL that he wasn't listing to her anymore. This infuriated CL more than ever and she stepped up the venom in her rant.  

&gt;CL: That dumb  [very mean words] should be fired. I hope she gets hit by a truck on the way home so I never have to deal with her again. She...  

This gets my managers attention. He's not in his happy place anymore and is now as angry as CL. He cuts her off mid sentence.  

&gt;Manager: NO! You will not talk about my employees like that. Get out of my store. Now!  

CL was completely shocked. As far as I know, nobody had ever stood up to her like that before. After a few seconds she walked out without another word. My manager seemed surprised too.  

&gt;Manager: Oh man. I'm going to get an earful about this from corporate. You heard all that. You can back me up on this, right? She was clearly going too far.  

I assured him that I would back him up, and he walked off still looking worried. Corporate called back later that day to say that she had filed a complaint about both of us (what did I do?), and that they had given her a gift card for her trouble. Nothing more ever came of it as far as I know and she continued coming in and complaining every day. But she never acted quite that crazy again.

I work in an eletronics department of a big box retailer. Now we aren't the biggest store so other stores normally  will get a high demand product before us instead, unless we order a lot of it before that happens. One of such items is a pre-paid card for home phone service. 

We had ordered hundreds of them just incase of a shortage and we got lucky because soon after it was out of stock everywhere. Naturally people came here instead of other stores. Que Old Lady (OL).

I was cleaning when I hear someone screaming  they need help. I signed walking over annoyed someone is screaming like a banshee instead of coming to me ask for help.

Me: ""Hi! How ca- "" she cuts me off
OL: ""YOU NEVER HAVE ANYTHING INSTOCK THIS STORE IS TERRIBLE!""
Me: slightly annoyed, but shrug it off ""What's the item you are looking for?""

Names off pre paid card

Me: ""Oh we have those right over here!""
I take her over to place I was cleaning and the card were there.
She grumbles about the layout, and not being able to find anything. So I chucked up her being rude as a side effect of a remodeling the store, and just mad at being confused. It's a common thing, figuring it was over. But boy was I wrong.

OL: ""THIS STORE IS TERRIBLE, NEVER HAS WHAT I NEED IN STOCK""

Me: confused ""Ma'am we have the item?""

OL: ""I know there are good people  here and I'd hate to see people not be working"" BLAH BLAH

Me: ""Some people  like coming here so that wouldn't  be good""
 
She laughed at me, and called me a liar. Saying  the store at the snooty town 20 mins from here  was better. I knew the problem now. She wasn't mad at items being out of stock here. She's mad she had to go out of here way to a back woods to get her stuff.

Me: ""Ma'am I have plenty of regulars who come here cause they like me and my department and-"" 
Cut off again, called a liar and that no one wants to be here. 
But before she could finish or I could respond someone jumped in who is the real MVP. Nice Dud(ND).
ND is my regular and loves me to death. He's a bit older and has a mental disability but I love him just the same.
He interjects

ND: ""OP, OP THERE'S MY GUY!"" He bear hugs me. ""HEY thanks for helping me with my application the other day, and I finally learned how to use Google like you showed me.""
I told him that's great and politely let him know I was with someone.

ND: ""Oh I'm sorry bud, sorry ma'am. Listen to this guy he way nicer than the folks at other stores""
 If looks could kill, the OL look furious. I was afraid she was going to go off so I stepped in between them.

OL: ""Oh I'm done. Let your FAVORITE help you.""
She walked away, so relieved helped my regular add a phone card to his phone and thought it was over.

Closer-To-The-Sun,A toddler unknownly shoplifts to show her parent something they like.,"I got a bit of a fun story from last night that I find more funny than anything.

First off, I work in a mall at a store that sells a lot of pop culture things (it's not really hard to figure out but still). I was working by myself for closing, and while it was expected to be a very laidback evening, it got fairly busy at one point. While helping a customer check out, I saw a woman standing in front of our store (near the seats in the mall) using her phone. She had a small child with her who saw something in our window that caught her eye. She repeatedly tried to get her mother's attention but to no avail. So, she walked into the shop and heads right to what she wanted, a backpack that looks like an owl.

Mind you, this child is without supervision and walks into the store by herself. She grabs the backpack and starts to walk out with it. The backpack, like everything we have in our store, has a sensor and the door's alarm goes off. Everyone in the store turns to see this little girl walk with this backpack out to her mother. As soon as the mother sees all of this, she hangs up her phone and guides her daughter back in to return the item. She apologizes as they both leave, with the daughter looking very confused as to what was going on.

All of us in the store had a good laugh about it.",TalesFromRetail,2044,1553121963
FinalAuthor,Customer tried to report me for no reason.,"I was reminded about this story during a conversation I had today, so I thought I'd share it.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, for context, I work at a fabric and crafts store. Not only do I work the front registers, but I'm also work in the craft department (or not really anymore? that's another story). 

About mid way last year, for the first time since I started working about 4 years ago, we reworked the whole of craft. We pretty much moved everything where it was to another part of the department, so regulars and other customers (and not to forget most of the staff) who had visited the store before were a little confused where everything was- and rightfully so, because so were we. 

For the sake of the story, I'm going to need to address that we stock a particular paper craft machine that can only be brought in my country from our franchise (unless you order from an online store). All the accessories for this machine used to be at the front of the department before the move. Issue was that we were getting more stock in than we could display, so all the products were moved into one of the longer aisles during the rework to allow for more room (thankfully). In it's place were going to be our artist paints and calligraphy section. 

This is where our story begins. 

&amp;#x200B;

On a weekend morning, my manager and I are stacking the now empty shelves at the front of the department, exactly where the machine and accessories used to be. Whenever we're asked a question my manager tends to take the reins. She has this unspoken rule where anyone who is working with her isn't allowed to talk to a customer for more than a minute so that we're able to get everything done that she wants us to do (and that is also another story for another day). 

We hadn't had many questions up to this point, and I've had to escort one or two customers across the department to find something, but other than that, we haven't had much trouble at all. 

About 45 minutes into stacking these shelves, a couple approaches us. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Lady: Where did all the (paper craft machine) things go?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: It's just down here, ma'am.

&amp;#x200B;

I stand up from my position and walk into the main run-way to point out the aisle- and by this I mean I walk up to the aisle and indicate where it is as they watch from where they were standing, before returning. It's clearly visible with a large sign displaying the paper craft machine's name and has an obnoxious green colour plastered everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Lady: But... why did you move it?

&amp;#x200B;

She had a disgusted and frustrated tone in her voice. I was completely taken aback and confused about why she had gone from 0-100. Before I could respond, my manager stood in.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Manager: We have more stock coming in so we've had to allocate a larger aisle to it.   
&gt;  
&gt;Man: But that's just confusing!

&amp;#x200B;

At this point the man angrily walked off. The woman followed suit, but muttered some kind of curse at me. Something along the lines of ""fucking unhelpful bitch"" or ""what a fucking joke""- it was hard to understand but I knew she had said something of the kind. 

&amp;#x200B;

About an hour had rolled by after the altercation. I'd had no trouble with any other customers, and neither had my manager. We had moved to another shelf at the front of the department- canvas'. This aisle was inline with the pathway up to Layby, which is where our store manager is most of the time. We're able to see every customer who lines up or any staff member who exits or enters. We aren't however, able to hear what is being said. 

All of a sudden I can hear hissing and complaining coming from the Layby counter. I look over and wouldn't you know it- the couple was standing there, grilling the poor lady serving there (I should mention is was mostly the woman doing the talking). Although I couldn't understand what was being said, it was obvious that she was upset, angry and very frustrated about something. I assumed that perhaps we didn't have a product she was looking for and the layby server had dealt the bad news. That papercraft machine and it's accessories were and are still quite popular, and at the time we had been running low on stock of some of the more popular products from the range.

After a minute or two the layby lady ducked into the office, and out came the store manager. Again, at this point I honestly thought it was a customer going over the top and complaining about not having something in stock- because obviously we need to read everyone's minds and have exactly what they want in stock, whenever they want it. However, it was only when I noticed out of the corner of my eye that the couple were pointing at me in the aisle did I know something was wrong. I instinctively looked to my manager, who seemed to have had the same thought. She prompted me to continue stacking, so I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple more hours pass by, the couple had left, and I had moved on to putting out more stock in our wool section of the department. My manager out of the blue approached me and ushered me to the corner of the wool section- pretty much the back corner of the store. 

She said that she had been called into the back office and practically roasted and interrogated. It turns out that the couple we had, had an issue with earlier complained to the store manager and it wasn't about low stock as I had previously thought. They accused my manager, and myself, of not doing our jobs properly. Not only did they insist that neither of us had shown them to the paper craft machine aisle, but an HOUR after the altercation, they had accused us of sending them to the layby counter to find out where the aisle was because apparently we 'didn't work in the department'. 

I was dumbfounded. What had I done to make them try to report my manager and me for doing nothing wrong? The only thing I can think of is that they were highly inconvenienced that the products had been moved *two aisles* down. I'd love to know if any of you have had similar experiences because this was just ridiculous. 

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: For clarification, the customers had said that my manager and myself were very rude and didn't try to help them find the aisle they were looking for (as I stated earlier I did, indeed, show them where the aisle was). They accused us of sending them to layby to ask where they would find the product, as well as claiming that I specifically had said that ""we don't work in this department"".

Scarlet-Ajani,No. Just because my car is parked in the back doesn't mean it's for sale.,"Looking back, my time at a certain family-run appliance store was pretty laid-back.  I played on my laptop for half of the work hours like everybody else, about 5 purchases could supply the daily quota, and the delivery truck came only once a week. I only had one ""bad"" day, but it wasn't story-worthy. My manager basically got a closing competitor's inventory for a bargain, and we had two whole mac trucks of loosely-packed supplies. A few air conditioners were destroyed by toppling off a tower of about 7 units. It was put to the fault of the ones who stacked it, breaking laws/rules. I don't know the details, but they received punishments.

The job was so laid-back that a certain family project, an experimental car built by every guy related to me, got parked in the warehouse to have ""professional"" work time. Our tools were way better than the ones in the wooden shed. The ""experimental"" part of it was whatever way we felt like powering it that month. It ranged from small gas motors, to electric, to water attempts, to even rubberbands and industrial springs we found in a junk yard. Only the obvious worked so far. 

I didn't so much power the car as I was better at styling and interior. I put a small tv and radio in it, and styled the body like a rocket. I can't give a photo, but here's a sketch of my original intention that I made:

[https://sta.sh/01ii5y2cy2rl](https://sta.sh/01ii5y2cy2rl)

This thing was never, and will never be for sale. It's just a family tradition at this point. It's been a solid 17 years of grease and welding.

Sometimes people would see it through the windows of the storage room door and ask questions, but they never assumed that it was up for purchase given it's rough appearance. A few kids even sat in it and played with the controls that usually weren't plugged into anything.

However, this story wouldn't exist if this guy, DA, didn't come in one day. He even had a wife, who I'll call GW for ""good wife"".

I'll be OP, and there's two coworkers/family members C1 and C2.

DA: What the hell is that?

OP: It's a project car.

DA: How much is it?

OP: Oh, it's not for sale.

DA: But it's in the store. You have to sell it to me.

OP: That's not true.

DA: Don't argue with me! My son has been looking for a car for months, that thing will do fine!

OP: It doesn't even have an engine in it.

DA: Then how did it get here, huh?

C1: We got a trailer. It's parked outside.

His face was getting red.

DA: Sell me the car. 

OP: It's not for sale.

He basically said the exact same thing for about 5 minutes until he walked off to his wife, who was just looking for a decent stove. We went about stacking shelves until he suddenly disappeared. I had C@ look around while I checked the cameras in the back next to the car. As soon as I got to the window, I saw this guy in the drivers seat, rapidly turning the key and messing with wires trying to turn the car on. I called C1 and C2, C2 watched the store from the door as we walked over to DA with our arms crossed.

C1: You're kidding me, right?

DA: This car is terrible! You can't sell it like this! This is horrible service!

Is this guy serious?

OP: This car is not for sale, and the engine is currently suspended over your head.

DA looked up and saw a strange amalgamation of metals and plastics with stray splashes of paint and wires everywhere. I still don't know what it's intent was, but it was the engine.

He sputtered in anger, red like McQueen, as his wife stomped in and just glared at him.

GW: What are you doing? 

DA: They are refusing to sell this car for our son.

GW: WHAT? This is piece of crap!

Might sound rude, but I did nickname it ""Mr. Ugly"" so I don't care.

DA: I can fix it up!

GW: No! We are getting him the Honda, end of story!

DA: I am getting this car, and none of you can stop me!

C1: Sir, you are trespassing and possibly damaging our property. Leave now, or I will call the police.

He has two options: forget the non-functioning, experimental, rusty, three-wheeled joke of a car; or get arrested.

He got arrested.

Banned from the store and paying a fine. All the money we got out of it was put into the car, of course.

HoneyBadger162,No...I'm not gonna let you buy that for your probably underage daughter.,"So this happened earlier today when I was put on the tills (because short staff, yay! Love you guys!)  

A young girl (Est. 14/15) had come onto my till with her dad, but they were paying for their stuff separately, anyway, the dad buys his stuff, and the girl pays for her stuff.  

But there's a bit of a problem, this girl, who is pretty small and very young looking, is trying to buy a BBQ lighter, so as per the policies (and *THE LAW*) I ask for ID, and this goes down:  

&gt; Me ""Hm...Can I see some ID please?""  
&gt; Girl ""Oh, I...Don't have it on me.""  
&gt; Me ""Well i'm afraid I can't sell it to you then.""  
&gt; Dad ""Oh i'll buy it for her.""  
&gt; Me ""Uhh...No, I know it's for her so I won't allow you to buy it for her.""  
&gt; Dad ""Oh okay then""  

I then called for a member of management to come to my till since I have to get them to scan saying i'm refusing a sale (Or if I just hit the wrong button by mistake like the idiot I am sometimes), and lo' and behold, my supervisor was right next to me, watching the transaction, I didn't even realize it and I just felt so relieved yet anxious because of what could've happened.  

But atleast the two were alright about it, I wonder what goes through their heads sometimes...

The whole thing was really sort of silly and weird. I didn't really know how to react and it definitely wasn't bad.. but I don't get why these two random strangers would think the sales girl wants to be with their son.

\- JC = Jerk Customer

\- MOD = Manager on Duty

\- Me = Me

&amp;#x200B;

(TL;DR at the bottom)

&amp;#x200B;

So where to start... I work at a major hardware retailer in the next town over. Said work place is about 15 minutes from my house and takes 2 roads to get there. I am on my way to work as usual and going 53 in a 50 (I would go faster but the cops in my area tend to pull you over when you go 51) When all of a sudden JC in his Piece of S\*\*\* truck decides I'm not going fast enough and decides to pass me at 65 MPH and to do so he crossed a double yellow line to do so. Not only did this guy pass me at insane speeds for that road, he also gave me the bird while doing so. I'm mad but I have a pretty good idea of where he is going since one of the few businesses on that road is the place where I work. Sure enough when I arrive to work I see his ugly, green, rusted truck in the parking lot. But not just in any space oh no, he was in the front most handicapped spot. I KNEW This guy was not handicapped as there were no placards or stickers to indicate that he was allowed to park there. I'm pretty pissed at this point because he could not bother to, to wait the whole 30 extra seconds it took to get there. I walk in the door not expecting to do anything or to have the issue resolved. Then I see my Manager standing at the door greeting customers. BINGO.

&amp;#x200B;

ME: Hey! MOD, How are you today?

MOD: Doing Great how about you?

ME: Great thanks for asking.

ME: Hey! You see that green truck parked in the Handicapped spot?

MOD: Yeah!

ME: He is parked there illegally. Don't we enforce that by towing people?

MOD: Yeah we do but I'm not going to worry about it.

ME: Well I think we should. At least just this once.

MOD: Why?

ME: \*Explains the situation and what the guy did.\*

MOD: Says she will deal with it and proceeded to call the towing company.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't hear anything for a while and clock in and head to my register.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I hear screaming from the front door. JC Is yelling and running toward his truck which is mostly loaded onto the Tow Truck (it's at the point of no return). He then comes back into the building where he starts cussing out MOD and saying that we have no right to tow him. ( The whole time I'm sitting there with a S\*\*\* eating grin on my face and enjoying the front row seats to the show.)

&amp;#x200B;

MOD: Im sorry but you did park illegally and we reserve all right to tow vehicles parked illegally on our property.

JC: F\*\*\* You!

MOD: Well Next time don't flip off my associates.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think he got the idea of what he did and that I was the guy he flipped off but he definitely learned his lesson about parking illegally, I hope. I later heard that he called the store demanding that the associate who reported him was fired immediately, but they dismissed his call because it was ""Not directed toward his experience"" and was ""A result of his own actions"".

An0therSunr1se,I'll have you arrested for doing your job!!,"Another post reminded me of an oldie but goodie.

Years ago i worked at a convenience store/gas station. We sold typical convenience store items, including beer and cigarettes. A young woman comes in one day and asks for a pack of smokes. She looks about my age (19), so i ask for ID just in case. She doesn't have it so i have to decline the sale. She is polite and friendly, and simply says it's ok and leaves. 

She is parked right in front of the store, so i can clearly see her get into a car, and an older woman (OW) get out of the same car and come in. OW asks for the same cigarettes. I tell her I'm sorry, but i saw that they were together and could not make the sale, as i knew the cigarettes were for the young woman. She completely goes off on me. It's been years so i don't remember exactly, but she was ranting at me about how her daughter is old enough, and it shouldn't matter anyway because she (OW) is purchasing them now.

I do what i always do, politely explain that I'm sorry, but it is the law. I cannot legally sell to anyone if i have even the smallest reason to believe they may be purchasing for a minor. If her daughter would like to come back with some ID, i will gladly sell to her. But the woman isn't having it at all. She rants some more, and ends it by telling me her husband is a police officer and I'll be sorry, because she's going to tell him all about this. Finally she leaves, and i try to puzzle out exactly why i should fear a police officer if I'm following the law...

The funny part? A few hours later a cop walks in. He asks if i was the cashier who handled the above situation, and i confirm indeed i was. So he apologizes profusely for his wife's behavior, and commends me on doing a good job. I only wish she had been there so i could see the look on her face. Also, the daughter did come back with ID another day. She was never even upset, so I'm not sure why the mom lost it like that.

AmyChazy,Mom got annoyed because I wanted to check her daughters ID,"(On mobile, english not first language)
This story took place while I worked my shift at a local gas station here in germany.

If you want to purchase cigarettes in germany, you have to be at least 18 years old. Within the last weeks the company I work for got tested by ""test-customers"" (Testkäufer). They would purchase Alcohol and or cigarettes and just check if the cashier checks their ID. You could really get in trouble for not asking them for it.

With this in mind I ask everyone who looks a bit young for their ID.
In came a young lady (L). She told me the number of the pump to pay for gas and also ordered two packs of cigarettes.

Me: ""May I see your ID?""

L: ""Actually, it's in my car right now, shall I get it?""

Me: ""That would be nice of you, thank you."" 

Since she was so nice, I wondered for a moment if I should just sell her the cigarettes and tell her it's ok, but now that I asked, I had to stick with it.

A few moments later, this women (W) comes to the cash register.

Me: ""Hi, how may I help you?""

W: ""Number X (The number her daughter had not payed for yet, because I paused the transaction until she came back with her ID) and those two packs.""

Me: (realizing it has to be young Lady's mom) ""Ah, of course, that will be xx euros, please."" :)

W: (with a very cold, annoyed tone:) ""She pumped gas, so she OBVIOUSLY is 18!""

At this point, my eyebrows almost touched my hairline. Being confronted with this level of stupidity, my brain started to sort out which of the 100 reasons I could have for aksing her daughter, who looked really young, I should give her.

Me: ""You know, we get tested a lot at the moment. Also, I could loose my job for not asking for an ID when selling cigarettes.""

She then left without another word. Not even a goodbye.

I had a lot more to tell her, for example that pumping gas does not mean anything. There is no law that you have to be over 18 to pump gas. Also, in germany you can get a driver's license at the age of 17, if a parent is your co-driver. And hey, here stands this MOM. Telling me her daughter must be 18 for pumping gas.

eLlARiVeR,"""Can I get it 50% off?""","If you've worked in retail long enough you've probably had the same/similar experience.

Got a call over the radio for a price check, The customer had two shirts off the same rack that had a sign saying $17, however one of the shirts was ringing up $29. As I was the only one on the floor I went ahead and took a look. Turned out it was our fault as there were two different types of shirts on one rack with only one sign (we do something put two different styles on single rack but there needs to be a sign for each program on either end of the rack). 

No biggie! We give the lady both shirts for $17 and I start moving the shirts and getting ready to sign them.

That's when the lady next in line jumps out of line and runs over to the rack (the rack was pretty close to the registers so she could see exactly where I was and over heard the conversation) and sees me with both arms filled with the shirts. 

Thankfully I was able to grab all the misplaced shirts before she got over there, cause the second she approached me she asked ""Are those the same shirts the other lady had?"" 

Realizing she was trying to get in on the mistake and save a few bucks, I told her the shirts still on the rack were $17 and the ones in my arms were $29. I move away and place the shirts in my arms on a table nearby and begin scanning them to see what shirts signed together and what didn't. 

At first she pretend to look at the $17 dollar shirts  a bit, but the second I moved away to get a sign I saw her go over and grab the same exact $29 shirt the first customer had. When I was no longer in hearing rang I told the cashier over the walkie that the customer was well aware of the price of the shirt and to not change the deal for her. 

I thankfully didn't have to deal with her again, but the cashier later told me that she pulled out her phone and said ""I found a 50% off coupon online but there's no promo code or barcode, could you find it for me?"" 

1) the coupon wasn't even on our website
2) we've never run a 50% off, EVER
3) we currently weren't running any coupons as there was a big sale going on in store.

15-ish years ago, I worked at a retail store on the corner of a really dangerous intersection. The first time a car drove *into* our store, we panicked. Well, we panicked every time, but whatever. The employees were running around doing crowd control, calling the police, etc. I was busy trying to ring up customers who mostly couldn't understand that they couldn't pay with a credit card because the car that was sitting in the dvd section just took out our internet line, and then when the computer crashed putting their items on hold. Anyway, the employees finally shooed all of the customers outside and got out ourselves, we were standing outside watching the cops tape off the store and basically milling around going ""wtf do we do now"" when an older lady pulls up (I don't remember where she parked or HOW she possibly found a spot, most of the parking areas were taken up by police, wreckage, and probably employees) and ambles toward the store. I was already freaking out pretty hard but in the back of my head I'm thinking ""she's not. She can't. She's going to another store. She's just here to gawk. She can't possibly..."" She did. She made her way to the police tape and lifted it over herself to walk in. She made it as far as starting to open the door when someone ran over to stop her. Even then, she was confused. The manager had to say something along the lines of ""see that car? That's halfway in the store? That's not supposed to be there. We're closed."" She was super confused, even after that. ""So I can't buy my Peter Frampton cd?"" ""Uhh... No... Even if we could let you into the building we aren't able to make any sales now because the computers aren't working..."" ""Oh... Why are the computers down?"" ""Uhhh. Because that car that is halfway inside the store knocked out our internet and probably jiggled something to do with the computers..."" ""Oh. So will you be open tomorrow?"" ""... Probably not."" ""Oh. Ok."" Of course, this conversation took place inside the taped area with her hand on the door almost the whole time. I'm still baffled by her, even all these years later. It makes me feel better on days when I'm completely oblivious to what's going on around me.

kyspeas,"I almost worked myself to death, but was saved by a kind old lady.","I got my job at a local grocery store in a tourist lake town a month before the height of summer. I would stock shelves and bring in carts. It was a particularly hot summer, one where the news cautioned viewers to stay indoors and to drink lots of water. Surprise surprise, tourist’s don’t listen to the news. They were out in full force, often left shopping carts all over the parking lot, and would clear out the drink aisle pretty thoroughly. 

I alternated between bringing in carts and keeping drinks stocked on the shelf. I hadn’t taken my break and was getting very thirsty. We weren’t allowed to have drinks on our person, and my bosses were very strict about rules. We could be written up and sent home for an untucked shirt. If you got three strikes in on month you’d be dragged into the office and usually fired. I had two strikes: for having an untied shoelace and an untucked shirt as a manager walked by. 

I couldn’t afford the third strike so I was busting ass trying to get merchandise out on time before a manager came by. Without having a drink for five hours, and being out in the sun, I began to overheat. My heart started pounding faster than it ever had and hurting like someone was squeezing it. I ignored it, and worked through it. Occasionally I would get a pulse of pain that would cause me to recoil, but I was 17 and didn’t think a stroke or heart attack was possible. I actually thought my back and ribs were just hurting from all the extra work. 

While I’m clutching my heart, an elderly woman comes down the aisle to ask if I could help her find something. I describe the aisle she’s looking for but she’s suddenly afraid and starts asking if I’m alright. I assure her that I am, just a little tired, but my heart pulses enough to make my eyes shake and knock me to the ground. 

She immediately calls an ambulance. It isn’t too long before they show up. I refuse to be taken to the hospital, as I wanted to finish out my day and not have a third strike. The night manager, who had been called in since we were understaffed and busy, told me not to be silly. She waved my two  existing strikes, and begged the owner to install a water fountain. She and the old lady were friends, and they both didn’t leave my side until the paramedics were finished with me. Since I didn’t go to the hospital, she had me call my mom to pick me up and have my sister drive my car home. I was pretty embarrassed but the paramedics said I was lucky the old lady came along.

OL: where's the coupons and stuff for the grand opening?

Me: we'll have that available next week for the grand opening.

OL: But THIS is the grand opening weekend!

Me: no ma'am, it's next weekend.

OL: well, eh, (website) said it's today!

Me: I'm sorry, but that's incorrect.

OL: I want to talk to a manager now!

M:  how can I help you ma'am?

OL: I came down here from 30 minutes away, stood outside for an hour for the grand opening, and I'm told you aren't having it?

M: who told you that was today?

OL: (website)

M: I'm sorry ma'am, we aren't responsible for someone not affiliated with the company and what they say.  It's been published on our website, the paper, and the news in general that it's next weekend.

OL: I want compensation!  This is wrong.  You shouldn't tell people the wrong thing and waste their time.

M: again, our company did not tell you that day.  If you go by an unofficial source, we can't do anything for you.

SlytherinAhri,"""I don't know"" isn't a response to what I'm telling you, lady...","Fuel clerk 

Our gas station is currently closed for maintenance, we have workers here running tests on the mechanical stuff inside the pumps/tanks. That being said, not only do we have ""out of order"" bags over every nozzle, but the pumps themselves are opened so you can clearly see all the internals and eletronics inside. Enter OW for oblivious woman. For those who live outside the US or don't know what Shell is, it's a huge franchise of fuel stations and for some reason they accept our rewards cards despite not being affiliated with us. 

OW: Let me get 40 on 4. 

Me: We're closed for maintenance right now, we'll be back up in an hour or so. If you need to use your fuel points, Shell also honors our rewards card and there's one right down the road.

PumpkinFaceYT,"""Why do you need my PIN number?!""","I just recently came across this sub and have been reading some of your stories, and I happened to remember that I have some stories (plural) of my own to share. So here goes!

So I work in a well known grocery store in the UK (17 y/o male by-the-by). This store is known for being rather middle class-y as stores go. You don't get much of the weird whacky people that visit corner stores and the like.
I've been working there 4 months and this happened I wanna say 2-4 weeks ago.

It was getting towards the end of my shift, one hour to go exactly, when a woman joined the line (which was about 6 people long), she looked to be quite old but I'm not sure if she was quite a pensioner. Either way, I will now refer to her as SL (strange lady).

I serve the customers without a hitch, business as usual. SL eventually reaches the front of the line. I noticed at the time that she had shopping bags from other stores with her, meaning she had done most of her days shopping before coming here. This will be important later.

I started serving SL, everything goes as normal, until we get to the transaction stage.

SL chooses to pay with card and insert it into the machine. Again, nothing unusual about this. But you can imagine how confused I am when she asks me why she needs to input her PIN NUMBER!

""Why do you need that? No, you're NOT having it""

At this point I'm so stunned I can't even respond, I couldn't even ask SL why. After staring at her for a few seconds in bewilderment, I tried to explain why she needed to enter her PIN, however I fell flat to persuade her.

All this is going on in full view of the now 7 people in the line, and at least another one hundred people in that part of the store, which may I also add is in the center of my city.

After I failed to persuade SL, the customer standing behind her decided to lend me a helping hand, and joined in trying to change her mind. I don't know what she did differently, as she spoke quietly as to not draw more attention, but whatever it was, it worked.

FINALLY SL put her PIN number in and the machine started working on the transaction. Now these card readers aren't the fastest thing in the world, they take a few seconds if you're paying by inserting your card and not contactless. She grows impatient barely two seconds after pressing enter on her PIN.

""Has it done it yet?!""

I don't answer for a few seconds, allowing the machine to finish before then thanking her as I do after serving everything customer. SL withdrew her card from the reader and grabbed her stuff and started packing it, in front of everyone. It took what felt like years. Usually in this circumstamce people would move their stuff further away from the cashier so I can at least start serving the next person, but no, she stood right there, blocking me from moving on, also INSULTING MY ABILITY TO DO MY JOB while packing her things.

Eventually, though, SL was finally ready and waddled off. The next customer giving me an 'I really feel your pain' look. Thank god that was over, my nerves were in shreds having to live out this whole thing in front of many other people with paranoia and anxiety biting at my heels the whole time, in case I slipped up and showed cracks while dealing with her. And unfortunately for me this would not be the last time I would encounter her.

The next encounter would be too long to fit in this post down here, so if you want me to write up the sequel then let me know.

Peace.",TalesFromRetail,684,1552475664

ecowfer13,Complaining Shoplifter,"I run a store that sells a mix of pop culture and adult items, as well as a lot of cheesy gag stuff (if you know what I mean...)

Having the adult items tends to attract the idiots who think it's perfectly okay to take what they want, because why not? This last weekend, I was doing my required closing shift, and it was a relatively quiet night. This couple comes in, a young guy and his girlfriend. I've seen them in the store before, and as far as I'd noticed, they were pretty mellow and okay. Turns out I was wrong...

I went into the back room to get something, the door to which is in the middle of the adult section. Something I'd overheard from the couple twigged my spidey-sense, so I stood at the door for a moment, listening. Sure enough, the guy was talking the girl into slipping a toy up her sleeve. We'd never know!

I sat down to watch the cameras, because yes, I have TWO cameras on that section alone. I watched her pick out her toy (the appropriately-named ""Wallbanger"") and they started wandering the store with it. I went back out to the floor, and kept them in sight. At one point, some kids knocked some items off of a display, and they helped me clean it up. Then they wandered back to the opposite corner of the store, and sure enough, the toy went up her sleeve.

I went back to the front of the store, and as they were walking out the door, I stopped them.

""Hey, where did you put that toy you picked out?""

""I put it back.""

""Actually, I've been watching you, and you haven't been back to that corner since you picked it off the wall. Can you show me where you left it, please?""

She walked in, the boyfriend trailing behind us both. I give him credit for not bailing out and leaving her behind, at least. As she walked through the store, I could see her trying to discreetly slip the box out of her sleeve. She got it out just as she got to the other corner, and handed me an opened box. The Wallbanger was still in the box, thankfully.

""Great. Thanks for that. By the way...you and your boyfriend are now banned from the store. I don't want to see you here again.""

""What? Why?""

""I watched you put the toy up your sleeve, you left the store with it. I could have you arrested for shoplifting. Be glad I'm just banning you and your boyfriend. Now please leave.""

I followed them to the door, and as they walked out, I spoke one more time.

""By the way, the next time you decide to try to steal from a store? Don't talk about it in the store.""

They both paled, then turned and walked away.

NOT THE END.

The next morning, I'm opening, and the phone rings. I'm not fully awake, and I don't answer the phone with my name like I normally do. The voice on the other end asks for a manager, which wakes me up. I identify myself, and the girl launches into a complaint about the guy who accused her of putting a sex toy up her sleeve and banned her from the store for no reason the night before.

""Yeah...that was me. I was the manager last night. You're still banned.""

Five seconds of complete silence, then a soft click as she disconnected the call.",TalesFromRetail,2753,1552435510
FinalAuthor,"Ma'am, I can't cut your ribbons here- no, we haven't been cutting up here for more than 8 years!","New to this sub-reddit so I thought I'd start off with a simple story.

Long context though:

I work at a Fabric and Crafts store, however we also sell Curtains for some reason. In our Curtains and Dress Fabric departments, there is a row of 4 counters with meter rulers and cutting guides made into them (3 with a register attached). In total there are 6 cutting counters available in the entire store for customers to head to. As it is our largest department, our Dress Fabric cutting counters are the busiest. On days that are very busy, the previous rolls brought up by customers tend to be thrown onto either side of the 2 middle counters, leaving only 2 cutting spots open. The staff try their best to clear the counters to allow for a 3rd area but more often than not, it's just not possible wth the influx of customers. So because there are only 2 people cutting, and the amount of people that decide they want fabric cut all at the same time (as well as being unaware there is ANOTHER cutting counter around the corner in Curtains), some impatient customers are not very polite when they show up at the front registers to pay.

I've had many experiences with customers complaining that the wait took over 30min-1hr (which is ridiculous as I've had MANY shifts in the department before, as well as brought a lot of fabric from our store; the wait was 5-10min tops). Some decide to take matters into their own hands and bring whatever they want cut up to the front counters... which, because we do not have the proper cutting equipment at those counters, we cannot do that. You'd get a bit of grumbling before suggesting them to the Curtain's counter, or they'd straight up place the product at the front and leave entirely. 

However, being a Craft store, our usual customers are old ladies whom tend to be quite impatient (despite having the time to knit many sweaters, scarves and sew multiple quilts) and like to stir up trouble. 

The following is the exchange between myself (me) and an elderly lady (customer) that I had recently:   
*~~\[Keep in mind that I've served this lady MANY times in the past to the point we could practically be on a first name basis.\]~~*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Hello again! Did you find everything you needed?  
&gt;  
&gt;Customer: Most definitely. You have scissors up here, don't you?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yes we do. 

I open the draw underneath the counter to retrieve some scissors. I'm assuming that she's wanted some tags cut off whatever she has (I've done this for her before). 

&gt;Customer: Perfect. *(Proceeds to lift entire basket full of cut-by-the-metre ribbon spools onto the counter)* Just these for today. 

I look up to see the basket and stop what I'm doing. This situation has happened before, and I'm already bracing myself for the wrath of a 80 year old woman. However, I presume that she's forgotten (as she is old) and remain professional and polite. 

&gt;Me: Oh... I'm sorry, Ma'am, but I cannot cut these here.   
&gt;  
&gt;Customer: Sorry?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I'm unable to cut these here.   
&gt;  
&gt;Customer: But you have scissors, why not?!

I reach back into the draw and pull out the scissors. They're very small, kids-grade scissors which we use to cut tags and paper- definitely not appropriate for ribbons. 

&gt;Me: These are the only types of scissors we have up here.  
&gt;  
&gt;Customer: Oh, they'll be fine! I only need 2 metres of each.   
&gt;  
&gt;Me: We also do not have proper measuring equipment for the process.   
&gt;  
&gt;Customer: What? You don't even have a ruler or measuring tape?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: We do have rulers, however they're only 30cm ones. Not big enough for a transaction such as this.   
&gt;  
&gt;Customer: You cannot be serious- I used to have things cut up here all the time! They're just ribbons!

Now, I really would have liked to have cut these ribbons for her if I could, however, my managers have cameras installed for security reasons behind and in front of the registers. When they're bored, particular managers will just sit in the back, not working their departments (like they should be doing) and just watch the counters because they can. There have been MANY phone calls made to the front by managers doing exactly this, calling out employees for standing around and talking (even if it's about work). There was no telling whether someone was watching, so I really don't like to risk things such as this.

&gt;Me: I'm really sorry, but I can't. I could get in trouble for doing so- it's just our policy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Customer: Nonsense. I've had ribbons cut up here before!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I'm sorry, Ma'am, but I'll have to direct you to a cutting counter.   
&gt;  
&gt;Customer: This is ridiculous. I've just come from there! Last time I waited in that line it took over 2 hours to get to me. *(Of course over exaggerating)*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I understand that, however I can walk you down to the Curtain's counter.   
&gt;  
&gt;Customer: But I can't get these cut down there.   
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Oh?  
&gt;  
&gt;Customer: I'm not making curtains, nor do I have any curtain fabric to cut.

You would presume she was trying to make a joke, but I assure you she was dead serious about the matter. 

&gt;Me: That's okay, Ma'am. They're able to cut all fabric's and ribbons in the store down there. 

She huffs a little bit before I escort her to the Curtain Department. This doesn't stop her from complaining though.

&gt;Customer: I'd like to have a word with your manager. *~~(Here we go)~~* Only a few weeks ago you were able to cut all types of fabrics at the front of the store.

We were never able to cut fabrics or ribbons at the front. None of our stores allow it. Not even when our store used to be situated down the road at a smaller location, more than 8 years ago. 

&gt;Customer: And why do you only have one person serving at the cutting counter?

There were surprisingly 3 people serving all day. 

&gt;Customer: Your management needs to get a grip on their customer service and employ more people to work those counters instead of being lazy and paying no-one at all! 

We tend to get this complaint A LOT, despite the only reason there's any hold up at the counter being the sheer amount of customers who want items cut at the same time. (They'll be waves. You all understand.)

The lady complained all the way down to Curtains and continued to complain long after I left. I feel bad for the soul who had to sit through cutting every single one of those ribbons. I hope she was a little more thankful at the end of it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Not the most exciting story but it's a simple yet very common occurrence I tend to face in my line of retail. Do you guys have any complaints you get ALL the time?

sgtpaintbrush,"""Look for the girl with the blue hair, she knows what she's talking about!""","A wholesome example:

I used to work at a garden market in a wealthier area and was allowed to have blue hair. One day, a woman comes up to me asking if I could come talk to 'Ms. Grace' outside in the parking lot because she was unable to get up the ramp to the shop (the woman who approached me was her assisted living nurse (**ALN**)), and she had a list of flowers and amounts of the flowers she wanted. I said sure got a notepad and got a list from her. Her Aln and I walked around getting the flowers, we didn't have enough of the color she wanted in that kind of flower, and I was worried she would freak out on me. The aln called her and the woman asked what other kinds we had in similar colors. Sometimes we ended up dangling flowers over the fence to show her in the car and she would say yes or no. She was very flexible with me, never got frustrated or an attitude with me and we ended up getting her flowers she was satisfied with. Her and her aln were very grateful and I felt good for having done a good job with even my manager complimenting me on a good job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that was the end of it, but the next day the aln comes back saying that they wanted to get some more flowers and that Ms Grace had said ""Find the girl with the blue hair, she knows what she's talking about!"" It made me feel so good. We got her more flowers and she asked for my full name so she could write the company telling them what a good job I did.

SpoonieToidGirl,"""But I Am ALWAYS a Size 9!""","I work at a shoe store and I had a woman come in wanting to try on a pair of shoes. These shoes she wanted to try on are unisex, however, obviously the size for men and women are different.

&amp;#x200B;

The woman asks for a size 9 so I go to the back and get out a size 9 for her. She tries it on and says it is a bit too small for her, so I suggest going a size up. The woman frowned at me and said ""but I'm always usually a size 9... Can you get me a size 9 in men's?""

&amp;#x200B;

I explained to the woman that the conversion of sizes makes it different and that a size 9 in men's fits like a size 11 in women's, obviously way too big for her. I suggested going to a size 10 in women's. 

&amp;#x200B;

The woman shook her head and she was very adamant, saying ""just bring out the size 9 in men's. I am always usually a 9. This is ridiculous.""

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to go to the back to get a men's size 9 pair out for her in the case maybe seeing the physical size difference would make her change her mind. I brought it out and she insisted on trying it on. Even just at a glance, the shoes were way too big for her and she had to tie the laces really tight just to get them to stay on her foot. However, the woman nodded. ""Yup, this will work. I told you I am always a size 9!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I kept asking the woman if the shoe fit alright (which it clearly did not) and if her heel lifts up as she walks (which it clearly did) but she insisted it was good. I even tried to convince her to just try on a women's 10 ""just to be sure"" and she insisted the men's size 9 was good. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a while, I reluctantly began to ring her up when she said she wants to wear the shoes out and for me to throw away the box. I told her that this would make the shoes final sale and there will be no way of returning them once I throw out the box and let her wear them out. Again, I asked her if she was sure the size was okay. The woman nodded and said ""I am always a size 9. Have been for years."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I cringed as she wobbled out of the store wearing the shoes that were too big for her. I talked to my manager about what happened and my manager, like me, was confused but since the woman was adamant she get those shoes, we just disregarded it and hoped she wouldn't turn it around on us and make a complaint to customer service about how the shoes we got her were ""too big"".

So I work in retail liquor, and a few years ago I was busy being bored out of my skull on a slow Saturday afternoon in a small store.

Finally after nearly an hour between customers, a young gentleman walks in and attempts to purchase a six pack of pre-mixed bourbon and cola cans. I check his ID(policy is to check anyone who looks under the age of 25), he was 22, everything's cool. Tell him the price is $22, his face drops.

C: I've only got a $20 on me.

Turns out he was on his way home(another 20 minutes away) after a day at the beach with his mates, and all he had in his pockets was his ID, car keys and $20. We had a small jar where we kept loose change we found in store, so I thought I'll be nice.

M: No worries mate, found $2 on the floor earlier, I'll chuck it in for ya.

His grin cracked his face as he thanked me, and shook my hand vigorously before leaving.

So I close up after a couple of hours, go home, get changed and hit the town with my mates. Feeling good, few drinks in me, when suddenly I hear a shout.

She asked if I was okay and I informed her that I haven’t been sleeping well and that I have a little sinus issue, and that I had fallen asleep. She told me not to worry and she would even leave so I could get back to sleep. Turns out she’s a loving grandmother who was also a doctors assistant back in the day.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, on with the story.

&amp;#x200B;

A customer comes in and buys five cheese straws, we warn him that straws will still be red hot as they have just come out of the oven, in fact, the baker was taking them out of the oven as he was served. He thanks us for the warning, pays and then leaves the shop. Five minutes later he returns to the shop, didn't think much of it, as often with cheese straws people will come back and buy more. However, not this time.

&amp;#x200B;

He places the bag of cheese straws and asks for some alternatives because there was an issue with the taste. Confused, I pick up the bag and ask what the issue is, as I look in the bag I notice two have already been eaten as he replies 'They are too hot and too cheesy.' After a brief pause, I apologise and say that as he has left the store and eaten nearly half the   
product there is nothing I can do, especially as we had notified him that they had just come out of the oven which he had acknowledged. He starts to get annoyed so I call over the person in charge that day. The customer explains the situation again and the supervisor explains that as there is technically nothing wrong with the food and that he has eaten two of them we cannot replace them, besides the other cheese straws we had left were all from the same batch.

&amp;#x200B;

Customer starts ranting at us (Can't remember the whole thing he said as it was a month ago now) but it was something along the lines of  'I'm never coming into this fucking (company) again. Your head office will hear about this.' this is a threat we hear a lot so none of us took it too seriously. However, we did ring head office just to notify them that the situation had happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

Less than 2 minutes later, I left the shop to do our banking, and who should I see up the road? Yep, the customer, eating the rest of the cheese straws. Obviously there was not an issue with them, he was just trying to get a freebie out of us. As soon as he saw me, he hid the bag. I smiled to myself and went back to work, to tell my coworkers what I had just witnessed and then thought nothing more of it.

&amp;#x200B;

THE NEXT DAY

Arrived at work to find an area manager there. A complaint had been put in about the cheese straws and how we all apparently rude to the customer. Once we had all spoken to the area manager, and I had explained that the customer had eaten all the cheese straws after the incident, we were told we had done nothing wrong and no action would be taken against any of us.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm presuming that the customer was told that no other action was taken because the next thing I heard later that week was that the owner of the company had ended up having to ring the customer and asked them outright what flavour they expected cheese straws to be, because there was literally nothing wrong with the cheese straws from that batch (as a precaution our company will taste test a batch if a complaint is put in, and guess what, nothing wrong), customer ended up having a go at the owner and threatening to take us to Trading Standards. We laughed it off.

&amp;#x200B;

Big Mistake. Because guess who got involved. Trading Standards, who, coincendtally, also were perplexed as to the complaint, but they had to follow it through. Needless to say, they ended up doing nothing other than eating some free cheese straws and telling the customer to stop wasting our, and their time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Best part is, this complaint all stems from an item that cost £1 at most. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR- Customer bought cheese straws, complained they were too cheesy after eating half of them, got pissed that we wouldn't replace them, ended up complaining to trading standards who told him where to go.",TalesFromRetail,1582,1552037518
ProbablyJalen,Dude kills his lawn cause i dOn’t KnoW wHaT i’M taLkiNG aBoUT.,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

So I worked at a hardware store specifically in the garden section. One of the most common things that we sold in this section was weed killer. Since it was a popular item, I took it upon myself to learn the basic differences between all the different brands. I got pretty good at it and it became my favourite thing to sell. For this story you’ll need to know only 2 different brands. So brand #1 was our most popular since it actually works. However, it doesn’t just kill the weeds. It kills EVERYTHING. If the weeds were popping up between concrete or rocks then it’s the perfect brand to use. If the weeds were on the grass you’d definitely not want to use it since it’d kill the grass and even the soil under it. You wouldn’t even be able to grow new grass in any of those areas. So if you had weeds on grass you’d go with brand #2 which doesn’t kill your grass. Unfortunately, it doesn’t kill the weeds either so it was pretty useless. I know this from actually using it myself and from coworkers and countless customers telling me. Due to this I would always tell customers with weeds on grass that brand #2 is the best we have BUT I’d always tell them that it doesn’t work. I didn’t want anyone wasting their money on a bad product. Almost every customer I had appreciated my honesty and even thanked me for not letting them waste their money. This was not one of those customers. 

I was working a normal shift when I saw a customer looking at the weed killer. I approached him and asked if he needed any help. This is roughly how it all went down. 

Me: Hi, do you need any help?

Him: Yeah, do you know which weed killer is good?

Me: Yeah I do, so where are your weeds located?

Him: In my back yard. 

Me: Oh okay, are the weeds on top of your grass?

I’ve asked a total of 2 questions and already he looked REAL annoyed with me. 

Him: Uh yeah? 

Me: Okay then brand #2 would be your best bet but honestly, it doesn’t really work. 

Him: What? Why not?

Me: Well I actually used it before and it killed like 2 weeds. 

This guy starts getting VERY irritated and starts getting mad. I try to keep up my friendly customer service voice but in my head I’m annoyed af. 

Him: Did you even use it right?

Me: It was actually my dad who used it and I’m pretty sure he followed the instructions. 

Him: Pretty sure? 

Me: Well a lot of customers have told me it doesn’t work too. You can try it out for yourself if you want but it would honestly be a waste of money. 

Him: *sigh* okay then what about this brand? 

I look at he’s pointing at brand #1

Him: My friend told me it’s good. 

Me: Oh brand #1? Yeah it’s good but not for your situation. 

Him: Why?

Me: It’s a really strong product. It’d kill your weeds but it’d also kill your grass. 

Him: I can just put new grass seed after, right?

Me: That actually wouldn’t work. Brand #1 will kill the soil. 

Him: Kill the soil? Okay you don’t know what you’re talking about. How old are you?

I was 19 at the time but honestly looked more around 16. A lot of people asked me my age when I worked here thinking I didn’t know anything. Happened way too often. 

Me: I’m 19. 

Him: Can you get me someone older? Someone with more experience?

Now I had been working there for almost a year at this point and I’d say I’m quite experienced. Especially with the weed killer. There was only one other garden employee with me and he was much older than I was. He was pretty new, only been working there for a few weeks but he was “older” so I found him and asked him to help a customer by the weed killer. I watched from afar as they talked for a few minutes. The customer finally picked up a jug of brand #1 and walked off. Out of curiosity I asked my coworker how it went. Basically the customer said he’d just plant new grass seed if his grass died and my coworker said it’d work. My coworker didn’t know and I don’t blame him. Even I didn’t know about soil rot until my manager told me. Anyways, I told him about soil rot and continued my shift. 

A couple weeks later I had a shift with one of my closer coworkers and she told me about an extremely rude customer that she had the other day. A very angry man came in telling her how he used brand #1 in his yard and it killed his grass and the grass seed he planted still hasn’t grown. He even showed pictures of his extremely patchy grass. She told him exactly what I said about how the soil dies. He was really mad since he was told by my other coworker that the grass WOULD grow. Luckily that coworker wasn’t working that day. I don’t know all the details but apparently he was talked to the manager as well. The dude really should’ve listened to me but it’s whatever. I just wish I could see how bad his backyard looked. 

TL;DR
Guy thought I didn’t know anything about my job and ended up using weed killer that killed a bunch of the grass in his backyard. ",TalesFromRetail,1204,1552006151

snailtec,Threw a Tamper Tantrum Over ID,"This isn't an interesting story like other ones on this subreddit but I still talk about this to this day. I have dozens of stories like these but this is my favorite.

I worked at a gas station for a while, and at the gas station we mainly sold booze and cigarettes. On my second or third day I was on the register and had to get used to looking at IDS so I requested all IDS from EVERYONE. Because of this I've had grown adults act like children towards me. 

This older dude came in, early 50s, tall and big. Mind you I'm 21 but I look 12, I'm 5'1, and less than 100 pounds. He asks for a pack of cigarettes and I scan them in, and ask for his ID. He looked at me like I just hit his child or something, he was so angry from such a simple sentence.

customer: EXCUSE ME?

me: I'm sorry, but it's company policy for me to ask for your ID. I'm still in training. 

customer: NO it's fucking not! 

me: Sir, please. 

He mumbled something and literally THREW his id at my face. I just gave him my best smile, read over the ID and entered his DOB and gave it back to him. 

The entire time during that he was fuming about how he's blah blah years old, and I'm fucking stupid and whatnot. When the time to write his signature on the receipt came, he wrote ""FUCK YOU!"" on it and stormed off. 

I hope his banked called him about that receipt because we store all of them.",TalesFromRetail,621,1551851074
valkyrieofspoon,"Don't wanna pay $200 for your gas? Enjoy paying $8,000 for a new dock.","Kinda long; TLDR at the bottom

&amp;#x200B;

I worked at a small marina on a lake during the summer from when I was seventeen all the way until I graduated college and moved away. For the most part, it was the summer job every high school/college student dreams of. My boss was super laid back, most of my customers were super rich nice retirees that tipped well, and if there were no customers I could read, mess around on my phone, swim in the lake, etc. To this day it was the most enjoyable job I've ever had. For the most part my customers were in a good mood when they came to get gas for their boats. I can count the number of irate/bad customers that I've had over the course of six years on both of my hands. This customer is the only one that I had ever had that tried to get away without paying. It didn't end well for him.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was manning the marina by myself that day; it was still the off season (pre-Memorial Day) and we were only open on weekends. Most people were just starting to take their boats out of storage and business was super slow. It was nearing closing time, and I had a whopping total of three customers come by over the course of the day. Didn't make a lot in tips. I didn't really mind though, as I had brought along my DS and had spent the time playing Pokemon. I'm just about to head inside to start closing for the day when I see a boat speeding along to the dock. Now my boss' rule for taking customers at the end of the day was ""take them at your discretion"" which basically translated to ""take them if you want or turn them away I don't really care."" I had nothing better to do, so I decide to just stay open a little late and help this guy out. I got a little excited when I noticed that this guy (let's call him Mr. Mingy Moneybags, or Mr. MM) had a really fancy new wake boat. The people who own these things are usually filthy rich and tip well, as wake boats usually have monstrous gas tanks that can hold 30-60 gallons of gas (my car, for reference, holds about 15 gallons) and their bills are usually very high. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. MM pulls up to the dock and I helped moor his boat. I then start filling it up. I make myself comfy while I do this as Mr. MM said his boat takes 50 gallons and was almost empty, so it would take a while to fill it. This was back in 2013 when gas was still super pricey, and we only sold ethanol free gas so the price was just over $4.00 per gallon. Mr. MM complains to me about the price and I just shrug, saying that I'm not the one who decides what the prices are. He grows more and more agitated as the bill keeps climbing. I ask him if he's sure that he wants to fill up all the way. He just gives me a clipped ""yeah"" and continues to stare at the numbers ticking up on the pump. Finally, 47 gallons of gas later, Mr. MM's boat is filled and his bill comes out to just over $190 dollars. It was the most expensive bill I had ever seen up to that point. I turn to him and ask him how he's going to pay. He makes a show of patting his pockets and looking around his boat for a while. I just raise my eyebrows. He finally turns to me and says that he forgot his wallet. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have had people forget to bring money before. And I'm usually very understanding about it. What I'll usually do is hang onto something of theirs as collateral (usually a driver's license, sometimes their car keys or phone). I put it in the lockbox and wait for them to go home and grab their wallets. Pretty much everyone who owns a boat on this lake also lives on/near the lake, so it's never been an issue. Something that I ALSO did that I didn't tell the customers that I was doing was writing down their boat's tag number. If they didn't pay by the end of the day, I could give the tag number to security and the could pull up their boat registration, which had their name, address, the works. Up to this day I had never had to report a customer to security. 

&amp;#x200B;

When Mr. MM states that he doesn't have his wallet, I quickly glance at the tag on the side of his boat and jot down the numbers. I then address Mr. MM.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Well sir, it's the end of the day, so if you could hurry home and get your wallet ASAP I would appreciate it. I'll also need something of yours to keep as collateral. 

Mr. MM: Oh that'll take too long. Do you have a phone on you?

Me: Yeah, in my purse

Mr. MM: If you could give me your phone I can call my wife, she can drive down here with my wallet in no time.

&amp;#x200B;

This answer satisfies me, so I turn to go into the building and grab my phone. While I'm doing this, I hear him turn his engine on. Not too unusual, so I keep going on my way. Then I hear a massive VROOOOM followed by a loud crunch. I whip around and see this guy speeding down the lake. He had pulled a runner on me. BUT because this man is apparently an idiot he also forgot to untie his boat from the dock completely. He got the rope off the cleat next to him but had apparently forgotten about the one tied to the back of his boat, which I had left some slack on. Now, normally the cleats on the boat would lose in this situation, or maybe the rope would snap, but our dock was a super old, crappy, splintery mess. So instead the cleat that was nailed into the dock got pulled completely free, along with an enormous chunk of wood. There was also a huge crack running down the length of the plank. This dumbass was now speeding down the lake with a piece of the dock dragging behind him. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's not really much I can do about Mr. MM now, so I go inside and radio security. I give them the tag number, along with a description of him and his boat. I also mention that he damaged the dock and owes almost $200 in gas. They thank me and say they'll get right on it. I then text my boss what happened and sent him a picture of the freshly ruined dock. He is PISSED and says Mr. MM better be prepared to fix it. I then go inside and finish closing for the day. I had to include a note to finance about why we were almost $200 short for the day and explained that security was working on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The very next day my boss calls me. Security had gotten the police involved for theft and destruction of private property (the dock technically belonged to the neighborhood association). They got to him that very same day because of course they did, they had his address. Also, turns out the guy wasn't even married. He just told me that BS to get me to turn my back. The association threatened to press charges and bring the guy to court unless he agreed to the following terms:

&amp;#x200B;

1) He would pay what he owed for the gas

2) He would be banned from registering a boat on this lake (it was either for 10 or 15 years, I can't really remember)

3) He would pay to COMPLETELY REPLACE the dock he damaged

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. MM, apparently belonging to the ""throw money at problems to make them go away"" school of thought, or perhaps just realizing that if it went to court he would probably lose (the whole thing was caught on the security cameras), agreed to the terms without much of a fight. The marina was closed for 3 weeks while the dock was being rebuilt. I returned to work after that to admire our brand-spanking-new dock. The new dock's planks were composite instead of wood, and we got brand new pilings too. No more splinters! The new dock cost the guy nearly $8,000 dollars. To this day, I don't understand why a guy with so much money to throw around got so agitated about paying $200 for gas for a boat that must have cost him well over $60,000. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: guys tries to run after refusing to pay his $200 gas bill, damages dock, has to pay $8,000 for a new one.

NeurologicalNonsense,"Customer tries to get a free phone repair, but ends up looking like an idiot instead","Technically my coworker’s story, but sharing it for him. I’m on mobile, so sorry for formatting. 

So I work for a company that repairs cell phones, and we have a very reasonable price for replacing screens that have been broken (think well under $50). If there’s no physical damage present, then failing parts are replaced for free. Pretty nice and customers are usually pretty happy with this.

Lady walks in, nose in the air, and asks how long it would take to repair her phone, because the LCD is no longer responsive. Coworker takes the phone and sure enough, there’s a few cracks here and there and lines going through the screen. CW = Coworker, L = Lady. 

CW: Ah, yeah I definitely see where the phone may be having issues! We could certainly fix this for you, but because of the cracks in the screen, it would be the [small repair fee]...

L: *in a suuuuper whiny, pretentious voice* No. It won’t. Because I’ve brought it here to be repaired before and [Company] waived the fee! I’ve been a customer just soooooo loooonnnggg!

CW: Ah... okay... well unfortunately I don’t have a way to do that for you in my syst—

CW: *turns to look in our parts drawer and ignoring the sass* Let me look for you ma’am! 

L: Yeah, I’m not paying for it. I didn’t have to before and I won’t now. I’ll call them. I’ll call [company] because I KNOW they’ll waive it for me! I know they will! 

CW: *walks back from checking our parts* Yep, so I do have those parts, I could do that repair for you today if you’d like...

L: *already holding her phone up to her ear, and acting like she somehow magically is connected within seconds to whomever she thinks waives these type of things. She looks at my coworker super annoyed like he’s interrupting her* NO. You’re not going to TOUCH it until I have a chance to tell them what’s happening. Because I knoowww they’re going to waive it for me!

CW: Okay ma’am... No problem... Just let me know what they say...

At this point, L walks over and sits in one of our waiting chairs near our work station, and proceeds to “talk to someone” on the phone... She makes a big show of saying and spelling her last name, rummaging through her purse, and overall making a scene about being on the phone with some kind of customer service. 

What she DIDN’T realize, was that we could plainly see her screen from where we were sitting, and she was most definitely not on the phone with anyone... Not only that, but she kept accidentally turning on her phone’s flashlight (not typically an issue when you’re actually on a call..) and she had an ACTUAL phone call come through (phone started audibly ringing) while she was pretending to be speaking to someone. Of course she makes this big show of “Oh! Oh I’m going to have to put you on hold!” while she randomly presses on her screen... 

L: *after literally being “on the phone” for maybe 3 minutes* OKAYY! They’ve waived it!

postrockandcats,That... Isn't where that is kept. At all.,"I am a kitchen and bath designer in a big box retail store. What I lose in creative autonomy I make up with good benefits and pay stability. Right now, it's worth the payoff. 

If you've never been to a kitchen design center in a big box store (or even a private design studio), there are sample doors everywhere that show different door styles and colors from the different cabinets manufacturers. Said doors have a ""linear foot price"" on the back of them; it's an average price based on a super basic 10x10 foot kitchen with super simple cabinets. It's used as an industry-standard comparative tool to figure out if the cabinet you like is super expensive or not. 

This guy comes into my showroom. I ask him what his project was and he said he was just looking. Which, honestly, is fine- some people just like looking and imagining. So, I do my ""if you have any questions, please ask"" thing and go back to my computer and keep working on the design I'm doing.

About 5 minutes later, he starts shuffling through my wall-O-sample doors. About a minute after that, I hear him doing the annoyed sigh thing. Which is... odd in my neck of the woods. So, I get up again and ask if he had any questions about the samples or if he was looking for anything in particular. He said thanks but was still just looking.

... K. So, instead of going back to my computer, I start cleaning the showroom and kind of hang around where he is. Sometimes, people get overwhelmed by the process of remodeling a space and don't know how to articulate their questions. He wouldn't be the first and won't be the last. It's why I am here.

I watch him go back to the sample doors, look behind one sample door, get a tiny bit frustrated, and move on to another door. He keeps repeating this for a few doors until he's getting visably frustrated at whatever he's seeing. So, I approach him again.

Me: ""Sir, I can see you're getting frustrated. I'm not trying to sell you anything- I just want to help you find what you're looking for. Is there a cabinet in your home that you're trying to match?""

Him: *sighs loudly and looks through another couple of sample doors like they killed his dog*

Me: ""SIR.""

Him: ""I... I just don't understand where you people keep your sinks!""

Me: *internal windows blue screen.*

*reboots*

""... Wat.""

Him: ""I need a kitchen sink."" 

Me: ""um, {location in store}. Would you like me to show you?""

Him: ""no."" *stomps away*

Y'ALL. It's been a year since this happened and I am still baffled. What the hell kind of Time Lord technology did he think I had behind each sample door? Why would anyone think saleable product is behind a sample of an unrelated product? Why am I even surprised by any of this? Customers are weird. ",TalesFromRetail,2825,1551660160

bobbledolm,"Ma'am, I mean.. Sir.","At a garden store I used to work at, we had only 2 (slow/rather manual) registers and in the book stuff we'd grow, we didn't put tags on everything. We also got really busy at growing season, and the line would be perpetually long. So we would have 2 people at the register, ringing people up, and sorting/counting items as they came through. I got flustered doing the latter, so I was often running the till. 

When I used to work a drive thru window, I learned to not get overwhelmed by realizing I only ever had to deal with 2 people at a time (window and speaker box), so I got tunnel vision a little, and had a script in my mind. It helped with my anxiety, too. 

At the garden center, similar thing. Tunnel vision, script. I had gotten in to a habit of calling some people sir and ma'am every few people, if they weren't androgynous presenting. I thought to myself ""man, I'm going to accidentally call one of these people the wrong label,"" and probably within an hour, my self-fulfilling prophecy came true. It was a ~35 y/o man with his wife/girlfriend, and i don't know exactly but I think he asked me to do something for him after the transaction, no issue, ""Yes ma'am"" 

O.O 

I looked at him, with a slightly amused/taken aback look on his face. I start apologizing, explaining I had gotten in the habit lately, and I had just been thinking I was going to do this accidentally. 

I(F) have a pixie cut, and I have been called sir multiple times, and I told him that briefly. 
Thankfully he was really cool about it and laughed with me at myself (in a nice way). 

When I think back on this, I cringe a teeny bit but it really just makes me laugh.

Rebel-Lucy,Her mother forgot her,"So a quick little story here that happened just this afternoon. 

Some of you probably know what a home-shop or pick-up lane is, if you don't its the lane where customers who have ordered their groceries online stop so we can bring them out and load them. Our store, unfortunately, has a single space home-shop line so we only ever service one car at a time despite being a busy store.

Well, someone parked their car in the one spot we had and ran inside, she had a buggy with her and was shopping normally. She was going to use the one space we had that was clearly marked ""store pick up, no parking at any time"" because it was drizzling and she didn't want to get wet. We had both managers on duty working near the front window, they saw this and immediately confronted her. She got really uppity with the managers and said that her mother was in the car and if it really was that big a deal to go tell her mother to do it. I guess this is the point where I clarify this woman had to be in her 40's ish and her mother was most likely in her 70s-80s. 

Well, the manager being the saint of a man that he is goes outside to ask the mother to move, at this point I'm watching through the front window cause I'm kinda board and its been a slow stocking day for me. The old lady seems nice from what I could see, she was smiling and and just gets in the other side, waving to the manager as she drives off. I keep watching her car kinda absent minded and see her pull up to the edge of the parking lot, over to the road and she just drives out of the lot. 

As soon as the manager comes back in I ask him if she's going home to grab something. He said no that she said she was just going to park so I point out that she drove out of the parking lot and left. He kinda shrugs at me and says it's none of our business. Well, it became our business half an hour later when her daughter is screaming at the front desk saying her mother left her. Turns out her mother has dementia and it's kinda bad, as soon as she pulled away from the spot she completely forgot why she was at the store and just went home. The daughter couldn't get her mother to answer the phone and was trying to blame us for her mother leaving. 

I don't know how they handled this but I just couldn't help but laugh to myself. This woman was so rude to us when she walked in and ignored all our clearly posted signs. Her inconsiderate behavior got her ditched at our store and on some weird level, I find that beautiful. ",TalesFromRetail,3027,1551422525

M- Hi, did you have anything at the cash today ?(sales associates would usually prep the items and leave them at the cash desk when the line was long so all we had to do was scan and wrap to make things go faster)

L- No I’m here to make a return, I want a refund. 

M- Ok can I see the item and the receipt? 

L- I don’t have either, they’re at home 

M-*Pauses*...do you want to go get it and come back? I can’t give you a refund if you don’t have the item.......

L- Its the wrong size I just want to get a refund and order  the right size since you guys don’t have it in store. 

M- Okay in that case I can order the item for you and you can pay for it upfront and bring back the other item for a refund OR you can come back with the item and I can just do an exchange and order the new item, either way you’ll have to come back. 

L- *starts yelling* I’VE WORKED IN RETAIL BEFORE I KNOW YOU CAN GIVE ME THE REFUND YOU JUST DON’T WANT TO DO YOUR JOB and storms out

Newhookk,Do NOT say Hello to customers!,"I work at a gas station. Our policy (among other things equally as silly) is to say “Hello” to each customer. I’m a good worker and even though it feels unnatural (at first, I’ve grown used to it now I guess) I will do it. 

Most people say “Hi” or another greeting. Some people ignore me and that’s fine too. But never have I seen or heard anyone over react this much.

This old and large guy waddles into the store with his jaw reaching the floor for some reason. I say “Hello” as I should. And he just stands there, narrows his eyes and stares at me for a good 3 or 4 seconds with that mouth still wide open catching flies. 

“Can I help you?” I ask, really confused at what’s going on. “No!” He shouts as if he is somehow offended. I am sure I gave off a confused and puzzled expression. He simple stood there for another moment before approaching and paying for his gas. 

— as long as I’m complaining, when I asked if he had air miles he gave out a hard sigh and tossed it on the counter, this dude was really pissed at something. — 

We finish the transaction and he is almost out the door, just one more waddle. “What you sayin’ hi to me for!?” He shouts again with his hand on the door. He brought it up literally 5 minutes later.... 

“Just being friendly.” I said. It’s easier than to say it’s a policy but maybe I should have said that. “Yeah don’t fucking say hi to strangers. Freaks them out. You should know better.” Then he just leaves. Every word out of his mouth was if I insulted him and he responded in an offended tone. 

He was obviously pissed at something but I simply said Hello to him and he got set off. ",TalesFromRetail,2411,1551257798

cyphiedk,"Customer tries to return beds, had to call store owner while basically laughing at the guy","I've worked in retail for many years at different companies, so I'll have a few stories to share here.

Here goes one I often tell people.

Some background for context, I live in Denmark where we have a law stating that if an item bought from a business is sold faulty, the customer is by law allowed to get a new item or have the one repaired (returning items and get money back, is actually up to the store).

So I worked at a department store focused on beds and duvets mostly (they have other stuff for interior too but the store chain is mostly known for beds and duvets), my job was managing the back of the store where everything was stored, and my duties consisted of that, taking deliveries and making sure that things specifically ordered for customers was set aside, also had to get the bigger items for customers that they couldn't carry through the store, and last but not least..... returns of the bigger items...

It was a quiet day when suddenly a middle-aged man pulled up with his car and trailer loaded with 2 box spring mattresses and a top mattress, and he started to unhook them while I approached him.

He said that he had a complaint over the beds, and wanted to return them per the law I mentioned at the start, because they were faulty. He wasn't exactly happy, but at least he brought his receipt, which most people tend to forget, meaning we can't help them when we can't confirm when the item was bought.

I proceeded to ask the usual about what was wrong with them, as there were no visible damage to them.

He then hit me with the bombshell.... he wanted to return them, because the beds were too hard, and his wife fell out of it..

I'm usually one that talks a lot, but I was speechless and asked him ""are you serious?"", customer annoyed at me for that question ""of course I'm serious"".

I said that I couldn't make that decision so I had to call the store owner, so I proceeded to walk the few metres to where the work phone was and had to turn around and whisper so he wouldn't see or hear me, and told my boss ""dude you have to come out here, I have an angry customer that wants to return something, and I can't take him seriously"", and also told him the reason.

It didn't take long for my boss to come out, and he didn't believe that anyone would actually try to do this. I went back in to do some more of my duties, but I could hear the shouting from the man, saying that he would be contacting our head office so file a formal complaint.

My boss came in afterwards, shaking his head and laughing. He got a call from the regional manager a few days later and told me that he had also laughed the guy away. It wasn't uncommon in these stores to get crazies trying to complain to try and get compensated with a more expensive item, despite their complaint being BS.

So yea, if you want to return a faulty item fine, just don't make up BS excuses because you want a new bed, with excuses this bad it's not exactly hard to see what you're trying to do ;)",TalesFromRetail,1494,1551182174
Award930,Dinosaur brings in a 5 year old weekly ad and is shocked when I don’t honor the price.,"Work in a retail drugstore chain as a manager. Had a interesting encounter with a couple of ladies who were stuck in the past and took out their frustration of the internet on me!

They will be D1 and D2 = dinosaur1 and dinosaur2 

I’ll be M=Me 

I get called up to the front register by the cashier and see two older ladies glaring at me as I walk up. They have 8 boxes of cereal on the counter so I figured it was an issue with a coupon. Nothing new, whatever. 

M: Hi, how ar- (she cuts me off mid sentence) 

D1: ARE YOU THE MANAGER!? 

M: yes I am. How can I help you? 

D1:  YOUR weekly ad on MY phone shows that this cereal is on sale $2/8! THIS cashier is saying it’s NOT! 

D2: YEAH! What’s going on here? 

M: Hmm that’s odd. Let me check. 

I flip through our weekly ad in store and the cereal is not on the ad. That’s weird I thought, It’s the same ad online as it is in store. Usually I’ll just modify the price since it was like $2 off total per 2 boxes but their attitudes killed that chance. 

M: Yeah I’m not seeing it in our ad. You said you got that picture of the Ad on your phone off our website this morning? 

D1: YES! I went on your website and it was there! 

M: okay. Let me check on my phone. 

I proceed to go onto our website from my phone and look at the ad. The cereal is nowhere to be found. 

M: May I see your phone and the picture you have please? 

she hands me her phone. I scroll to the bottom and see the date for the ad was from 5 years ago (our weekly ads have always looked the same). She must have gone into google images and typed in weekly ad and screenshot a random picture she found. I’ve never before seen anyone do this. 

M: Ma’am, this ad is from 5 years ago. This did not come off of our website this morning. I would be more then happy to modify two boxes for the confusion but that’s all I do. 

D1: WHAT!!!! I GOT THAT FROM YOUUUR WEBSITE! 

D2: ONLY TWO BOXES?? I WANT 8! 

M: yes. This is not our current ad and I have no idea where you got this picture from. All I know is that it was not from our website. 

D1: WHO DO YOU TRUST NOW AND DAYS? YOU ARE A LIAR AND DOING FLASE ADVERTISEMENT! YOU SURE CANT TRUST THE INTERNET ETHER!! THAT CAME FROM YOUR SITE!! 

M: (pull up the website from my phone) Feel free to look. This is what’s on our website right now. 

D2: You must have changed it just now! (Because I have the power to edit our company which has 8,000+ stores website lol) 

M: Nope. Don’t have the ability to. Would you like the two boxes? 

They both sat there and complained under their breaths about how untrustworthy the new generation and internet is as D1 paid for her two boxes of cereal. They walked out of the store and got into a brand new $150,000 Mercedes Benz truck/suv. Old farts.

radeakins,Rewarded and punished,"Story from the Old Gas Station. I've got some many of these I should start my own Subreddit.

2016 early spring. I just finished my shift. I clocked out and leaving to go home. I was still in my uniform and about to get into my car.

Parked next to my car in the staff parking area was another car with a young woman, around 18 no older than 20, on her phone balling to someone. She had a flat tire and didn't know what to do. The weather was awful, the rain was biblical. Typical British weather.

She saw me and asked for my help. I gladly offered. The traffic was terrible and gridlocked. I thought what the hell, I'll be sitting in traffic for the next hour anyway. 

I look in the car for the spare and the tools. The spare tire was there but no tools. She got upset again. I told her not to worry. Luckily today, I was in my big old American classic and it was a rolling restoration. My trunk was a mobile mechanics workshop. She got on her phone again to her Dad, 'You don't have to come now Dad, this lovely man from the Station is helping me'. 

She cheered up instantly. I got out my jack, breaker bars and sockets. I put some fresh air in her tire and she was ready to go. She thanked me, asked for my name, gave me a kiss on the cheek and left. I was soaked and cold but I felt good, I had done my good deed for the day. 

The next day, I arrive for my 10am start. The boss was there today. Half an hour into my shift, the young woman came in. She was happy to see me and presented a gift and card. She handed me them and thanked me again and left. 

It was a Thank You saying thanks and kisses for my good deed, that she emailed the retail head thanking me and the gift was a box of chocolates. This one of nicest moments of my life. A long term single ugly gorilla of a man with a long history of depression getting high praise and gifts from truly stunning young woman. I was happy.

The boss wasn't. He immediately called me into the office and chewed me out. Saying that we are not insured to work on customers cars. Regardless that I did after it after I clocked off thus in my own time. I even used my own tools. He just laid into me saying that I did it on site and in my uniform. Then he said I have broken my contract by excepting a gift from a customer and I would be receiving a disciplinary for doing so. And I did. 

I handed my notice soon after and left in the summer.

So I'd like to thank the young lady for the last happy memory from my old job. Thank you, Naomi.

When the line got down to a reasonable length I finished ringing my customer, flipped my light off and turned to take a phone call that had been holding for me. This lady drops her items on the counter with a huge clatter and I look up at her abruptly. After reigning in my ABF (active bitch face) I apologize and tell her so-and- so can ring you out, this till is closed. She grabs her stuff and starts to huff back, but then drops it back on the. I look over and my main cashier had already started to ring the next person in line. Karen looks at me and says, ""So you expect me to wait in line again?"" Acting as if it was the most unreasonable thing in the world.At this point I swallow my ire and say ""Nope! I'll just ring you our right here.""

I'm serving at the register of the gas station in the UK. Its a normal day, the line is steady but unending. The station has 8 pumps but is an old design and can only fit 6 cars at a time and the previous half dozen customers didn't buy fuel.

A middle aged man was next at the register. 

I ask 'What pump?'

Customer: 'The Ford' he said while searching through his wallet.

Me: 'Which one?'

Customer: 'The Mondeo' still going through his wallet.

Me: 'Which one?'

Customer: 'The blue one' he's getting annoyed now but still looking through his wallet.

Me: 'Which one?'

Customer: 'The one with the box on the roof' raising his voice now but still looking in his wallet.

Me: 'Which one?'

He finally looks at me in rage and shouts 'Are you taking the piss?'

I just point out the window, he follows my finger and he finally notices. His jaw drops. Six cars, five are Fords, four are blue, three of those are blue Ford Mondeos and two of the three blue Ford Mondeos have identical roof boxes.

Customer: Oh

Me: 'Which one?'

Customer meekly answers 'Pump 4'

SlytherinAhri,"It's fine, they pump my gas all the time","TLDR at bottom 

Fuel clerk at a single employee fuel kiosk that is part of a grocery store next door 


Just started my shift this morning and a young kid BARELY comes to my window to pay for gas, it was well above her head. She's old enough to walk around and kind of talk on her own, but definitely still uncoordinated and not old enough to grasp the fundamentals of a sale transaction because her mother had to mediate by yelling directions from a slightly cracked window of the car to avoid getting out in the cold rain that she'd just sent her child out into. 

The department manager (since we're part of a grocery store the fuel center is considered a department) happened to be in the back of the kiosk when it happened and we were talking about how lazy of her that was when she points out the window and goes ""UH-UH. DO YOU WANT TO GO BE UGLY OR DO YOU WANT ME TO GO BE UGLY?"" 

I look out the window and this woman is inside her car while the young child and an even younger child are attempting to figure out how to work the gas pump. The other was so young that he had to grasp onto the car and his sister to keep his balance and they're both pressing buttons, slinging the nozzle around and smacking it into everything including the side of the car. 

I go out there, motion for the woman to roll down her window and tell her that she needs to pump her own gas. I'll be me, LW will be lazy woman. 

Me: M'am, you aren't allowed to have children pump gas, you're going to have to do it. It's a law, I'm sorry. 

LW: /immediate attitude/ When did that happen? They do it all the time and nobody else has ever said anything. 

Me: They probably didn't see it happening, but we aren't allowed to let you do that. 

LW angrily gets out of the car, pushes the kids back into the car then gets back in herself, leaving the pump to pump unattended. Still illegal, but whatever. It's safer on its own than it is in the hands of two toddlers. Once it finished pumping, she sends one of the children out AGAIN to hang the nozzle back up and proceeds to go to the grocery store and approach customer service. 

LW: Your fuel clerk told me I'm not allowed to teach my kids how to buy gas. 

Store manager: Excuse me? 

LW: I was showing my kids how to pump gas and she came out there screaming at me that I'm not allowed to let me kids near the pump. 

Store manager: She was screaming at you? 

LW: Yes, she was yelling and being extremely rude in front of my children. 

Store manager then called the fuel center where I answered, explained my story and then put the DM on the phone to confirm that the woman was absolutely lying and insane. Store manager basically told her to get lost and never use their fuel center again if she's going to allow her kids to pump her gas. 

TLDR: Lazy woman sends her toddlers to pay/pump her gas in the freezing rain, doesn't like it when I tell her that's illegal and tells customer service that I verbally attacked her in front of her children

Fakjbf,Do you know how many people have touched those before you???,"Near the end of my shift at the gas station, a customer comes up to my register with a hot dog covered in ketchup and mustard. He seems distracted the entire transaction, mumbling to himself with a slightly dazed look (pretty sure he was a little drunk). He pays in cash, and holds out his hand for his change.

As I’m about to hand him the coins I notice that he’s holding his hand at an angle instead of flat out, and he’s not even looking at me. So I gently nudge his hand so that he can straighten in out and catch the coins properly. He glances at me and ever so slightly turns his hand, still a bit slanted but not as bad as it was. So I drop the coins into his palm, and they just slide off, right into his hotdog.

He immediately goes ballistic, telling me the I ruined his dinner. I told him he could grab another hotdog at no charge. He told me that he refused to eat the one the coins fell into. I again told him he could go grab a new one. He glared at me and yelled “Do you know how many people have touched those before you, and you dropped them right in my food”. I just calmly told him that he could grab a new one. He then said that he refused to pay for another one. I took a deep breath and once again said that he could grab a replacement hotdog for free.

Finally it seemed to click with him that he didn’t have to eat the hotdog the coins fell into, so he went off to the roller grill. I grabbed a paper towel and wiped off his coins and tossed out his old food. I looked up right as he walked out the door with his new hotdog. . . . leaving his change behind.",TalesFromRetail,2131,1550421401
DisturbedAlchemyArt,Am I crazy or is he on fire?,"Sorry on mobile, TLDR at bottom

Before I retired I worked retail in an independent agency of the federal government.  Customers tended to come in already highly upset and yelling from the moment their feet hit the floor. So I have tons of stories. This is one of the best though. 

So this particular man had a reputation for being very unreasonable. I don’t even remember what he was yelling about that day, but he wasn’t letting me say a single word or I would have excused myself to get a manager. While I’m staring at him and waiting for him to take a breath I thought I saw a wisp of smoke go by his ear. It’s been a long shift and I’d recently had a medication change so I though it was just me. My eyes were starting to cross by this time anyway.  He continued to yell and the wisps kept coming until it was a solid stream of smoke coming from his shirt. I have no idea how he didn’t see, smell, or feel it. He still has yet to slow down or pause for a breath. Finally out of desperation I slammed my hands down on the counter and yelled “Sir, you’re on FIRE!”  Turns our he had tried to extinguish a cigarette before entering the building and put what was left in his shirt pocket. It wasn’t completely out though and his shirt caught fire. 

TLDR-customer comes in to yell. He catches on fire, but won’t hush for me to tell him.

faezeldaag,"The Almost 100% Discount -- How a Customer Basically Robbed the Store of over $300, and did it Legally","The store was super busy -- midday on a Saturday, busiest time of the week. Almost every employee was working that day -- a few had been called in because of how busy it was. We were having a sale on all clothing items: 50% off their original prices. 

  There was a group of women who'd been shopping for hours, totally cleaning out the clearance section. They had so many items, it was crazy. One of the women asked my co-worker if the 50% was off of the original price or the clearance price. My co-worker answered her clearly saying, ""The original price."" The girl who was with the woman spoke over my co-worker and said ""It's off the clearance price!"" My co-worker and I *both* corrected her and told her that it was 50% off the original price, again. She nodded, said 'okay', and went back to shopping. Thinking we'd answered her question thoroughly, my co-worker and I went about handling our busy store.

   About an hour later we hear someone yelling at the registers and both of us look up to see what's going on. It's the woman we'd spoken to in clearance and she's irate. We both just go about hanging clothes, not wanting to get involved because we're already stressed enough with how crazy busy we are. But to our dismay, we get involved anyway.

  Walking towards us, with our manager at her side, is the woman who asked us about the sale. She's pointing at us, so angry she's red in the face. My manager walks over and says ""girls, this customer is saying that you two told her that our clearance sale is 50% off the clearance price"". We look at each other in total confusion. We'd told her the exact opposite -- we'd corrected the girl with her when she'd said it was 50% off clearance! Both of us immediately tell our manager this, but she's pissed and she's only worried about what the customer is claiming. 

  All of us go up to the registers to 'take care of it'. The woman told the story again -- in her version, we'd reassured her that the sale was 50% off the clearance price and, we'd corrected her friend when she'd claimed otherwise. Her friend vouched for this version of the story and, they demanded that they get the discount they'd been promised. For some reason my manager gave in, claiming (to the customer) to believe their story over ours -- she told the customer that we'd probably misunderstood her question, but that in the end, we'd been in the wrong.

  As the transaction was completed, my coworker and I were made to stand behind the registers. We felt like we'd been totally put on the spot -- the women were glaring at us over the counter and, they snickered at us when my manager decided to give them their discount. It was super unfair, especially when we'd given her the correct answer in the first place. 

 Let me just get all these details straight before I tell you how much money these women got off their purchase. The sale our store had going on was 50% off all clothing items. The clothes in the clearance section had already been marked down from their original prices by 50%. *They were already on sale* \-- the promotion our store was having extended that sale to all other clothing items. If you read the fine-print its obvious, it was written like this: 50% off all clothing items (original prices).  

 So all in all, this woman and her friends got off with the marked down clearance prices (which were already 50% off the original prices), 50% off of the marked-down prices and, an additional 30% for the inconvenience. So here's an example of how this discount worked: most of our clearance tops were $16. Half of 16 is 8, 30% off $8 is $5.6. This woman had at least thirty tops. $16 x 30 is $480! She got 50% off of that and, an additional 30%. That means that this woman literally paid $168 for a transaction that should've costed her almost $500. It's like she robbed the store of $312! 

It totally blows my mind that she got $312 worth of free stuff. But hey, the customer is always right, folks.

That_1bitch,Why do people think we can just give out stuff for free?,"So idk if food service really counts as retail but i know you guys can probably relate. I work at a bakery and most of our regulars are really nice, and i enjoy talking with them, but theres one guy whos rude and pissy every time he comes in. 

A little context: we have a sale on our donuts and muffins at the end of the night because we throw them out after we close.  (sale starts at ten, we close at 11). You can get 6 donuts, or 4 muffins for like $3.50. This is a steal because otherwise it would be like $8 and change. 

I have a few regulars come in for this sale pretty frequently, one of which is this old man. Ill call him OL. Im already on his bad side because ive refused to give him the sale early before. He comes in often, he knows it starts at 10. I have no idea why hed come in a half hour early for it. The most i do for people is give the discount ten minutes early but not any more than that. 

Anyway, OL comes in, takes forever to look at the muffins we have. Picks out four and then an extra one, so he has five in total, also grabs a bottle of milk. I ring him up and it comes to $7 and change, i tell him his total. 

OL: $7?? what the hell? Come on now! Why is the total so high?

I print the reciept and check it, the total sounded about right to me but it is possible i made a mistake. Nope. Theres the 4 muffin sale, one extra muffin, and a bottle of milk. I hand him the reciept to show him. 

OL: why are you charging me extra?? This is so expensive!

At this point im confused, i know he knows the muffin sale is four of them, not five. He comes in often and when he ordered he said he wanted the fifth one as an ""extra"" one. So i refrence the reciept  again and tell him the total is correct. 

OL: people here usually give me the extra one for free! You cant just give it to me!? 

I wanna make it clear, theres only one person who gives it to him for free, and that guy only works out front a couple times a week. No one else does this. Hes extremely rude and sarcastic every time he comes in, and honestly if he was nicer i probably would have thrown it in for him, but fuck that guy. 

So i tell him i cant do that, its against the policy, etc etc. He gets pissy, tells me to put it back, goes on this rant about how we're forcing him to go someplace else (good luck finding somewhere thats gonna give you free food buddy) starts slamming his money on the counter and storms out. 

I am just baffled that the most rude and sarcastic customer i have would expect me to give him stuff for free. If you want something from somewhere you have to buy it, its that simple.

SaltySorceror,Lady upset about the air freshener being 2 dollars more.,"I work at a relatively popular retail store franchise in my town. It’s my job to stock merchandise, answer customer’s questions, and help them whenever they need it. 

One day I was doing my usual work, nothing out of the ordinary, when I was called over by a man. 

“Excuse me, can we get the prices for these?” 

I head over, and see that he’s wondering if there’s a freshener like his in his hand that’s nearly a dollar and some cents. He’s accompanied by a woman. When the shelf clearly says $3.25, the woman with him seems agitated and asks him to ask the lady up in the front. 

“Sorry ma’am, the prices vary in every store” 

She gave me a quick response of “ok” and was on her phone. I suggested of looking for a different brand that was cheaper for her, when she quickly gave a snarky: “l don’t want your help” she said with a disdain, angry tone. 

I stood there speechless and confused, because they clearly called me over for help. I was just about to ask if it was the man who needed my aid, but she repeated with the same “I don’t want your help” with a look of hostility. 

“Alright, no problem” I said holding back a scoff. 
I went to the break room, to take a breather and just take in the whole thing. 

I was going to give her the benefit of the doubt of having a bad day. But, later my manager told me that she was giving attitude and behaving childish up on the front desk. I guess you can’t help stupid.

LordHappyofRainwood,Tales from the Gas Station 1. The day my wife received a complaint at two stores,"First time poster, finally decide to get things off my chest.

I manage the day to day operations of a small Gas Station and trailer rental. 

Most of the time things go swell with wonderful customers, good coworkers and some actually reasonable people a few rungs above us up the corporate ladder... Sometimes things get a little not so great. 

My wife also works for me and she received a phone call that went something like this:

Wife: ""Hello, how may I help?""

Customer: ""Yes, hi... I bought a propane tank that is leaks if I connect it to my grill, I need a new one.""

Wife: ""Yes sir... do you have a receipt?"" (We always ask, but try to be reasonable)

Customer: ""No, I just bought it two days ago and I need a new one and I never thought I'd need a receipt.""

Wife: ""Well, no problem we'll just swap the defective one out for a new one when you bring us the old one.""

Customer: ""No, I want you to send an employee to deliver me a new one.""

Wife: ""...wait... what?"" *Getting confused* ""We don't deliver propane tanks.""

Customer: ""Look, I have a bunch of people over for a bbq and I've already had some drinks, you *have* to deliver a new tank!""

Wife: ""We don't have a delivery service, sir, we can't leave during our shift anyway.""

Customer: ""Then pay for a cab to deliver it!""

Wife: ""What... No, sir... I can't fork out for a cab just because you are inebriated."" *At this point my wife's very limited patience is running low*

Customer: ""Just make the company pay for it!""

Wife: ""...Sir, if you want a new propane tank then you simply bring it here and we'll happily exchange it for you.""

Customer: ""You people really have no sense of customer service, and I'm running this matter up corporate!""

Wife: ""Okay sir, that's your prerogative."" 

*Customer hangs up*

My wife just moves on to the next order of business and blissfully unaware that the guy was loading up with more booze before entering into round two of the deliberations.

The phone rings again and my wife recognizes the number. The ones working with her described her look as  something I know all to well. It's that sigh/grimace that she makes after most my jokes.

Wife: ""Hello, how may I be of assistance?""

Customer: ""And you really have to try to understand that i know you don't make the policy and rules you, go by and it's not your fault but you should do this for your customer anyway and I'm filing a complaint against you non the less!"" 

Dude hangs up and we never heard more of the matter from corporate.

Bonus Round: On the way home we stopped at a grocery store to buy dinner and my wife sometimes get's stopped by random customers thinking she works there. 

(Kinda funny since the grocery store has different coloured, different type work clothes from our job)

So this customer grabs my wife's shoulder and demands help, wife snaps at her that she doesn't work there and the lady files a complaint against my wife AT A STORE SHE DOES NOT WORK.

ShayminSkyForme492,"I gave you no details on what I need, so you're obviously mentally deficient","This is a bit long, so TL;DR at the bottom.  

So, this isn't my story, but a story from a friend, and his first experience with an obnoxiously rude customer. Note that this was within his first few weeks of working at a large retail store, so he was still learning the ropes and a bit nervous about everything.  
  
At that store, if a customer called to ask a question about stock or if they carried a certain item, they would be redirected to a receptionist, so to speak, and then would be transferred to the proper department. Almost everyone dreaded picking up the phone because so often they didn't have access to a means of checking stock (there was a shortage of equipment) and most of the time the people calling would be the typical ""But it says you have it online!!!"" sort.  

So, my friend, let's call him A, was sent to answer the phone. At the time, he was working in the department that covered everything in the store that wasn't clothing, food, electronics, or makeup/health goods. This meant he had to answer questions about basically half of the store's products (yes, working in that department is literal hell, and he transferred out of it after about 3 months). The conversation follows, and is paraphrased a bit from what I remember him telling me. Rude Lady is RL.  

A: ""{Store name}, how may I help you?""  

RL: ""Do you have blue containers?""  

She gave no extra details about what exactly she needed. Did she need storage containers, and if so, which size? Did she need food storage containers? Did she need some other product? Did she want a blue-lidded container, or a completely blue container? As I said, their stock variation is huge, and just saying ""a blue container"" does not help at all.  

A tries to ask for specific details to narrow down what exactly she wanted: ""So, do you mean a storage container?""  

RL, now sounding angry: ""I mean a blue container! The lady that answered first (the receptionist) said you had them! How do you not know your own stock!?""  

A is flustered at this point, as he hadn't dealt with this sort of customer before: ""Ma'am, we have a lot of different containers, so I need more details to help you-""  

RL cuts him off, yelling at this point: ""How do you not know your own stock!? The lady said you knew! How incompetent are you to not know about something this simple!? It's just a blue container! Why do they hire r****ds like you instead of people who understand basic questions!?""  

Understandably, A is extremely upset at this point. He's new, but doing his best and doing a damn good job at it (he was actually promoted to an assistant manager position soon after he transferred departments). He's one of the smartest, nicest people I know, and was very popular among his coworkers for his attitude and work ethic. And now, this lady is calling him slurs because she refuses to answer a simple clarification question.  

A responds, and he tries to keep the emotion out of his voice: ""Ma'am, I can't help you if you don't-""  

RL cuts him off again, still yelling: ""Don't bother! I'll go call {other store} and talk to someone with a brain!""  She hangs up.  

A, understandably, had to go take a breather in the back after that.  

TL;DR: Rude lady asks extremely vague question about a type of item she wants. When my newly-employed friend tries to ask details to narrow down what she wants, he gets called an albeist slur. Friend has to go into the backroom to calm down.",TalesFromRetail,1149,1537979048

SamH-F,Meatman,"Hello, for context these events took place at a small supermarket in my quiet British hometown sometime around 06/07. 

A TL;DR will be available at the bottom of the story.

During the mid 2000’s there was a local convenience store war going on between 3 aggressively expanding supermarket companies in my area. As a result some towns in the area had multiple shops run by the same company within a very short distance to one another, the reasoning being that even a small store operating at a loss is better than a competitor having a location near you. The upside to this was that there were lots of part time jobs available for high school seniors at these stores. This meant that I, along with almost all of my friends, worked for just one company and that is how the story began.

I was midway through a shift in the small shop I worked in when one of my friends who worked in our sister store, a larger supermarket operated by the same company about 2 minutes away, came running in and was visibly excited. Trying to catch his breath the only thing he could get out was, 

“They’ve caught Meatman!”

Now Meatman for the uninitiated was a notorious local shoplifter, one of only a handful in our quiet little town and he generally targeted the larger store to steal (you guessed it) meat. He had been on a thieving spree for the better part of two years but generally only took small amounts of steaks or bacon to sell at the local pub, keeping his heroin habit going. 

His escapades weren’t really enough to warrant the larger store stumping up for a security guard as what he stole could easily be absorbed in the shrinkage budget of a store that was placed in a particularly low crime area. Recently however he had become more emboldened, clearing out the meat section of 2 stores completely within a week and so management had made sure that every employee within a 20 mile radius was made aware of him. He had started to become somewhat of a local legend.

Meatman’s MO was to wear a huge jacket with a piece of rope tied around the waist. This meant he could walk up to the items he wanted, shove as much as he could inside the jacket and run out of the store just as the staff clocked what was going on. The method was simple but very effective and he knew once he was out the door the chances of someone on minimum wage giving enough of a damn to actually chase him were slim to none.

Now, back to my friend. After calming down my friend began to tell me what had happened that day. He told me that a new supervisor had just started at his store. The supervisor was a young man who had just finished college and was eager to impress his new manager. As fate would have it, he would get that chance right away.

The young supervisor was arranging stock when he noticed a particularly shifty individual enter the store, a very skinny man wearing a very large coat. The supervisor thought it strange that someone would wear such a large coat, considering it was the middle of summer and decided to keep an eye on the individual. Little did he know he was about to encounter a local legend.

The skinny man walked with purpose straight to one aisle, the meat aisle. He stopped promptly beside the steak and after a quick glance around began hurriedly stuffing steaks, bacon and ham hocks inside the oversized coat. The supervisor being an intelligent individual reasoned that if the man filled his coat before being confronted it would make him easier to catch, the added weight of the meat along with the awkward coat discouraging the thief from trying to run, so he waited for the man to fill his coat. He was wrong.

The thief headed to the door but before he could leave the supervisor ordered him to stop. Much to his surprise the thief did not stop and actually began to sprint from the store and down the street. The supervisor eager to impress decided to give chase, knowing that the thief would eventually tire and that he had an advantage. He was a cross country runner.

The thief cut down all the alleyways he could see attempting to flee the supervisor but the young man could not be shaken from the trail. Panicking and desperate the junkie began to toss various meat products from his coat in an attempt to lighten his burden. Terrified by the pursuer and becoming weary from the effects of running with so much added weight on his person he abandoned all strategy and opted for the path of least resistance, down the hill on our Main Street spewing packets of steak and bacon behind him like some bizarre piñata. 

Eventually the toll on his drug addled body was too much and after almost 2 miles his strength gave out. He collapsed on the street hyperventilating and begging for mercy. The young man casually walked over and assessing the situation noticed that by a fantastic twist of fate he was exactly where he needed to be. The thief had collapsed just two doors down from the local police station and two officers were standing outside cleaning their patrol car. 

A brief chat with the officers and a search of his coat, revealing that for all his trouble he only had a steak and two packets of bacon left on him, along with the near 2 mile trail of meat products were enough to seal Meatman’s fate. 
He was arrested and my friend had ran straight over from his store to tell me what had happened. 

All I know beyond that is that Meatman was put on trial, he plead guilty and received a couple of months in prison. I moved away before he was due for release so I have no idea if he changed his ways. The supervisor received a commendation from management and a high street gift card for his troubles.

Note; personally I would not recommend pursuing an intravenous drug user, the dangers far outweigh the rewards. However the man in the story decided differently and now I have this story to tell. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR A notorious shoplifter was chased down by a supervisor, he spilled packets of meat for almost 2 miles and collapsed outside a police station.

stevela1234,“A rib roast for 13 FAT PEOPLE?!”,"I’ve been in the meat dept of a grocery store for years and anyone who has worked in the meat dept knows that the holiday season is by far the busiest. My first holiday season I had barely turned 19 years old. One day one of my regular customers comes up to me on a very busy day to place a pre-order for a rib roast for the holiday. No problem as we take multiple orders a day. I asked the customer how big of a roast she needed and she did not know. She was thinking and debating and making phone calls, etc. Finally she says to just cut her a rib roast big enough to feed 13 guests with good sized portions. She insinuated that she wanted everyone to have a nice sized chunk of meat. We have a special order book that we write the orders down in so the butchers can make sure to process all the orders as the holiday comes closer. So I fill out the special order slip and I write down her name and number and instead of figuring that she would probably need about a 13-15lb roast which would be about 5-6 bones, I just write down “rib roast to feed 13 fat people.” I was not trying to make fun of the sweet lady as she wasn’t that overweight really. My whole mindset was just to make sure the butchers cut her a big enough roast for 13 people with good sized portions and also to add some comedy I guess. I assumed that this special order book would only be viewed by the meat dept workers. Well my assumption was wrong. 

2 days later I am walking toward the meat dept about to start my shift and the butcher is there with the lady who’s order I took 2 days before and I see the butcher opening up the order booklet and I hear him say... “Ok ma’am, so you won’t have as many guests as you expected so you need to smaller roast. Ok, well let’s see what size roast we have you down for....” and he finds her name and her order in the book, and my eyes popped out and I felt so embarrassed and I almost died as the butcher reads out loud to the customer....”Your previous order was a rib roast ....to feed 13 FAT PEOPLE!!??” The butchers starts laughing hysterically thinking that it was the customer who placed the order like that. The customer then starts busting up laughing and said that wasn’t her that put down the order like that. That’s when my face was all red and I start apologizing to the lady and explaining that I just wanted to make sure the portion size was big enough so everyone had a good sized portion. I was so relived that this lady laughed it off. I could have gotten in big trouble with the store manager. This was a lessoned learned!! ",TalesFromRetail,3968,1537735918
SlytherinAhri,That's not how sales work...,"Our store has a sale on Marlboro cigarettes that takes a dollar off when you buy two boxes of any kind sans Special Blend. We also have a permanent sale exclusively for our store that is a dollar off two boxes of any ""original"" Marlboro, ie regular, light or menthol. So if you bought one box of standard flavor, you'd pay full price. If you got two boxes, you'd get 2$ off. 

Well a woman comes up and asks for a single pack of Special Blend light, a transaction which is covered by neither discount and she realizes that her total is more than what the sale sticker for Marlboro says. 

Woman: ""It says $4.87 on the thing?""

Me: ""You have to buy two to get the discount and you got Special Blends which aren't on sale right now"" 

Woman: ""Well, I don't need two""

Me: ""Well the discount only applies electronically to sales of two, I can't do it manually for you"" 

Woman: (Notices the 1$ off sign for mainline boxes only)
""And why didn't I get that discount?"" 

Me: ""Because it's for mainline boxes only, Special Blend isn't covered""

The woman is now getting visibly furious. 

Woman: ""You know what, just give me a regular light then"" 

I ring her up and in the process, remind her that although she'll get both discounts for these, she'll need to buy two to do so. 

Woman: ""JUST F*@CKING FORGET IT""

p480n,“I have a direct line to market!”,"Mobile blah


I used to work as a cashier at a large retail bookstore. It’s June and there are lots of young students coming in looking for gifts for their favourite teachers.


Enter Kid (K), probably around 12, and Mom (M). Also I’m Me (deep right?)


They come up to the register and ask for gift suggestions and where they could browse certain items around the store. I help em out and so far they’re super friendly. 


K finds a pillow with some teacher-related saying like “Don’t make me use my teacher voice!” or “Functioning alcoholism is correlated with wokeness” stitched onto it, telling her Mom it’s perfect and they decide to buy it.


I always make a point to warn every (non-regular) customer that comes up with a pillow that there are two prices on the tag, one for the pillowcase ($35), and one for the pillow insert ($14) Even though it’s clearly labelled it’s also totally reasonable for someone to get confused and assume the cheaper price is for the whole pillow, when it’s really both prices together (~$55 after taxes).


I let them know this as politely and “on-their-side” as I can.


Me: Hey, so I just gotta let you guys know before your purchase that the price of that pillow is actually both of those prices on the tag, and not just the top one. Sorry for any confusion!


M: Are you _sure_ this is the perfect gift for her?


K: * nods excitedly *


M: Okay that’s fine. We’ll take it! Thanks for your honesty!


Me: Yup! No problem. That’ll be $54.81.


At this point, M tries tapping her debit card. That doesn’t work, which isn’t uncommon, so I just get her to insert it. Payment goes through without a hitch.


I hand M the receipt. K starts skipping out of the store all happy with her pillow present. M starts reading the receipt with a disturbed look on her face. 


M: Oh my gosh! This can’t be right...


Me, nervous: Haha yeah, it sure adds up.


M: There’s two prices here... Oh, that’s sneaky. That was sneaky...


Me: Hey, I’m sorry about that. If you’d like, we can return it right now.


M: No, no... That’s so sneaky. I’ve got a direct line to market. They’re definitely going to hear about this.


Exit M.



A few things...

She had been informed of how the prices work several times. From my initial warnings of two prices, to her tap payment failing, to her manually inserting her card and inputting her pin to authorize payment of the price showing on the card machine, which I had also verbalized. 

Also what the hell is a “direct line to market”!?

This was such a baffling situation to me. She was so polite up until that point, then waited until her daughter was beyond hearing distance to spout some nonsensical threats. 


Anyway, as expected nothing ever became of her direct line to market and I died a little inside.

mentalfoam,magic door,"Many moons ago I worked nights in a petrol station fairly rubbish job but paid the bills. Now this station wasn't in the nicest of areas so had frequent shoplifters. My attitude to it was as long as they weren't blatant I didn't care in not gonna get stabbed over a pot noodle.

One time tho there was a regular thief was in just him. Clocked him stick 2 bottles of milk under his jacket thought I'd mess with him. So using the remote key i turned off the sensor for the door. Told him that we had a new thing added to the door that detects if the person has unpaid for goods and automatically locks door. He said didn't have anything and to let him go. Explained that it's new and that only cops can open it sorry they should be here any min. I said look mate I'm not saying that you have anything on you but if there is a chance he has anything to put it back and it should open.
Que him sheepishly put the milk on the counter as he done this I turned the door back on. So he went to leave and it worked. Still makes me giggle that the local thiefs thought we had a magic door lol",TalesFromRetail,1584,1537539936
bunnymagics,My No is still a No even after your tantrum.,"I've never had a story I've felt was really worthy of this sub before but after what happened tonight, I'm still kind of shook up, so I thought I'd share and hopefully calm myself down a bit. 

I'm a front end supervisor at my store and that puts me over the returns/money services we do for customers as well as over the actual checkouts. Tonight the store really slowed down after about 8:30, and I was chatting with one of the returns associates, we'll call her B, when a customer walked up. He seemed friendly and all so after greeting him and directing him to my associate, I wandered off to check on my cashiers.

Just a minute later, B flagged me back down to her but met me halfway-- something they do often at the desk, so we can be apprised of a situation without an audience of whatever angry customer is waiting. The Friendly Guy wanted a paycheck cashed-- but this one happened to be dated for tomorrow, unfortunately. I assumed B just wanted me to tell the customer myself and went to the desk figuring it'd be easy enough. He was friendly enough a moment ago, after all. Boy was I wrong-- on both counts, sadly. 

When I got to the counter and launched into the Postdated Checks explanation, FG's whole demeanor changed. He started cussing and yelling-- and then begging us to just cash the f-ing thing. I explained again that we couldn't, causing more of the aforementioned cussing and yelling.

And then it happened: the customer threw his phone at me. 

It landed behind me somewhere, just barely missing me, and at that point I was honestly scared. I've been in retail for almost four tears and I've never had a customer throw something at one of our employees. The rest of that interaction was kind of a blur-- more cussing and yelling, the phone retrieved and thrown again, and then finally, blissfully, the customer just left, probably because despite being extremely freaked out, neither B nor I were budging on something that would get us in serious trouble. 

B was as shocked as I was, but definitely more together because she's the one who reminded me this warranted a call to AP. They pulled video, I calmed down, and my closing shift resumed-- tills to pull, cashiers to send to break, etc. 

Thankfully, FG didn't come back, but I made sure B was walked out to her car, because you just never know. ",TalesFromRetail,2018,1537511825
najiblits,When a customer insists on getting $800 back without returning anything,"First off, I can’t believe I have never come across is subreddit.

I have so many stories after working retail for over 10 years. But one that always sticks out is the Pool Lady(PL).

Sorry it’s long! TLDR at bottom

I worked customer service at a large Canadian retail store, and during an extremely hot summer(which puts people in cranky moods to begin with) a not so lovely lady came in to return a pool.

PL: i bought a pool here &amp; I would like to return it. Here is the receipt. I would just like my money back because it has a hole in it.

(It was one of those pools with the blowup ring around the top &amp; that was where the hole was leaking air) 

I look up the pool warranty from the receipt &amp; she is within the time frame to receive a full refund. 

Me: Alright looks like it won’t be a problem. Would you like some help bringing the pool in from your car?

PL: why would I do that? I don’t have the pool with me, I just want my money back.

Me: Well we need the pool back to give you a refund.

PL: I can’t bring it in. It’s at home filled with water. I simply just want my money back. What are you not understanding?

Me: we cannot give you money back without physically having the item back.

This went back and forth for a few minutes. I really had no idea how to explain more clearly that we needed the pool back. She was not giving up. A Manager (M) overheard us talking and decided to step in to try and help.

M: sorry for the trouble but like my colleague said we do need to send the pool back to get a refund.

PL: If I bring back the pool, what will I do with all the water in it? You need to pay my water bill.

Specifically stated in the warranty it says that water bills are not covered by warranty. Also if you have had one of these pools, she should have noticed the ring was losing air long before the pool was even near being filled. Chances are it was damaged after she had filled it.

M: I’m sorry but we cannot cover the water bill. If you’d like to buy a new pool, you can transfer the water from one to the other and we will give you a full refund for the new one bought right away.

PL: Fine that works.

So we bring up a new pool and go to cash her out.

PL: what do you mean I have to pay for this one. I thought I could just take it home and come back with the old one and get a refund. 

Me: We cannot give you ANY money back without something to show for it. 

PL: well this is ridiculous. You are horrible at customer service &amp; I deserve every penny back for wasting my time. I’m just going to take this pool and not bother getting the money back. (As she tried to leave again without paying and take the new pool.)

M: Ma’am, we are going to have to ask you to come back with the pool before we can continue any further with anything. 

All of us at this point, as well as other customers overheating and trying to help explain to her how she’s confused, are all fed up. She looks at my manager and says well if i decide to pay for the new one how can i put the water in it in the same spot the old ones in. My manager no long had patience to deal and told her simple to put one on top of the other and flip it. You’d think she’d get that it was a joke, but she sat there for a second pondering the thought.

I pray she never reproduced. I’m also thankful I wasn’t there when she came back! 


TLDR; Lady came in expecting a full refund for a pool she had left at home filled with water &amp; couldn’t figure out why we wouldn’t just hand her the cash for it.

maladygris,How I ruined a marriage with one phone call,"So a few years ago I worked in a furniture store. In the store you could apply for a credit card to finance your purchase. I had an older lady come in (probably mid 50's) with a man in his 20's whom I assumed was some sort of family member. So we put through her application and set up an order with some previous details that had been stored in the system from years ago (usually attached to a surname and phone number). 

Everything went well, the loan was approved and the lady and man left the store. Several days later, when their order was in stock, I called the number on the order and was greeted with the voice of another man. He knew the customer, but he had no idea about the loan or the furniture. It quickly clicked in my head that she was eloping. As when I asked about her marital status earlier, she replied: ""I'm married but I might not be soon"", which I played off as a joke. 

Her now husband then asked if she had anyone in store with her, and I said I didn't remember, not wanting to reveal anything catastrophic. Then he asked for a copy of the order, which I provided, as it was his email address on the order and I am obliged to. 

Later that day I was met with a wall of shouting and insults as the customer berated me over the phone for ruining her marriage. Telling me that her husband didn't know. (Mind you, she had a copy of the order the whole time with her now husbands phone and email on it). She then proceeded to come into the store and shout at me again for another few hours, requesting my manager call her husband and explain to him the order was a mistake and that we had to cancel it. Which we did.

A week rolls by and she comes in and asks us to reinstate the order, this time with very large discounts for her ""inconvenience"". She filed complaints about me to the head office and I was written up twice (but refused to sign). The customer subsequently had her goods delivered to the young man's address... 

TL;DR A lady orders some furniture with us preparing to secretly elope. I called her husband's mobile and tipped him off by accident. ",TalesFromRetail,3429,1537419659
asmallman,Have you ever seen a customer explode before? It's awesome!,"Long. TL;DR at the bottom.

When I worked at a *insert biggest retail chain in America here*, we had an odd, but easily understandable way to display and sell our TVs. If the TV has ONE price tag on it, that means that was the price for the TV in box and the display was NOT for sale. If the TV had *two*, one would be clearly marked DISPLAY PRICE (as in that exact TV on the wall, because it’s about to be replaced) and the other price tag was for a new in box TV. The display price often reached INSANE discounts. The longer it sat there, the lower our system automatically lowered the price. One time we sold a 2000 dollar TV *brand new in box* for 200 dollars because it was the display. I wanted that TV and was sad that another coworker got to it first.

But my luck turned around. The *almost exact same model* minus a curved screen was up for grabs. Also 2 grand new. They were selling it for 500. A *really really* nice smart TV, 4K, Smart Hub, the fucking works.

A customer saw online we were selling a similar looking TV (different model number and resolution, 1080p) for 200 dollars. THE WEBSITE SAID DISPLAY ONLY PRICE. He came in and demanded the 500 dollar display.

He began threatening lawsuits for mis-advertisement, threatened to call the cops (what could they do?). Enough to where the store manager was about to cave and take the hit *personally.*

Here’s where I got sneaky. I got tired of waiting for displays that I wanted to come down, as I have been waiting for a year and saving up for a new TV to replace my 10-year-old 32 inch Sanyo (That TV is still used. It’s now in my bedroom as a monitor for me to play games while I sit on my bed).

The customer was outside ranting and raving at someone on the phone. So, during my 15-minute break, I walked up to the store manager (SM).

Me: I will buy that TV right now for 500 bucks.

SM: You sure? That customer is going to explode if he sees you with it.

Me: That’s fine. Ill wheel it out to my car and he can watch me load it into the back.

SM: Alright. Got tired of him anyway. He was being an ass to me and multiple associates. He deserves this. If corporate calls, I’ll show camera footage. That would be enough for us to be in the clear. Corporate won’t complain that I saved 300 bucks from being burned.

I literally walked right by that customer with that TV. I was happy that I got that damn TV. But the icing on the cake? He turned tomato red. Not kidding. Red.

AH: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?

Me: I saw this TV for sale and I bought it. Why?

AH: I WAS ABOUT TO BUY THAT!!!!!!

Me: Oh, I thought you didn’t want it anymore after you left the store. I didn’t realize you left to call someone. (I totally did btw)

AH: YOU GETTING SMART WITH ME? ILL KICK YOUR ASS!

(Here’s where I almost gotten reprimanded and coached. I couldn’t resist. The troll in me couldn’t be stopped)

Me: Sir, tomatoes belong in the vegetable section.

AH: WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY!?!?!

I booked it to my fucking car. Sprinting and holding a 55 inch TV over my head and slapped the back of my car door shut and ran back inside.

They got him out of the store by saying “You left the store. We don’t hold items. It’s our policy.” And, to boot, *corporate backed us up.* I dodged the reprimand because the customer couldn’t prove I made that comment at him.

I got a new TV. Made a customer explode. And, made my managers nearly die from laughing so hard. It was a good day.

TL;DR: Customer was super ultra pissed about pricing cuz can't read. Bought the TV out from under him when he made a phone call. Called him a tomato. Went home with a new TV.

Mind you, the kid isn't just trying the bike, he's riding as fast as he can and doing skids on this thing. His mum (I'm guessing) was just watching him do this.

skiba_rives,What it really means to lead a store,"Hey TFR, hope this kind of story is allowed. It's a bit of a rocky ride but with what I hope is a feel-good message about what happens when your manager absolutely rocks. :)

Relevant non-retail background information before we begin: I live with four other people in a two bedroom apartment which has honestly much too high a rent for its size. Due to circumstances I'm not too keen on getting into, we were short on last month’s rent which caused the household account from which we pay to go into the red. Since we couldn't make up the difference over the month, we wound up short.

When they tried to pull rent from our account, instead of overdrafting like we were hoping, rent just bounced. And we received a 3 day notice not long after, with the caveat that we come up with $2125(!) in money orders(!!) in three days(!!!). We're nearly $900 short.

Cue panic.

Now for the retail stuff: I've been working for the same grocery store company for 8 years now, and I've been at my current store for only 5 months or so. Over the years and over six stores this particular chain has had managers run the gamut of incredible (one once gave me $300 to go have fun at an anime convention with zero expectation I repay her) to absolutely god-awful. So I don't know how this particular store would pan out if I started asking my managers for help.

I bite the bullet and tell my immediate managers, show them the 3 days notice. All are sympathetic, but something close to $900 is just too much for any one of them to pull out of pocket. I understand, so I begin making calls left and right to various organizations, government or otherwise, hoping to get some help. Every lead I have is dead.

But then I remember, about a week prior I had to attend a meeting with several of my coworkers, run by the store manager, to inform us about an organization we team with, and have continued to support and donate to for over 25 years. This wasn't the first time I went to such a meeting, but it was the first time I saw a store manager that seemed openly enthusiastic about, and further, dedicated to it.

At this meeting, he told us that not that long ago a woman working at this very store was facing an eviction, and as a single mother whose family lived far, she had no options. He got the organization involved and helped her along the way, getting her a new apartment closer to family and continued employment at another store in the area. While it’s not quite as dire, I feel it’s worth it to give it a chance.

Out of options, I call. I tell the woman who I'm directed to the situation and that I'm an employee of the company they partner with  She says they can help. I about die of relief.

Fast forward the next day, my store manager happens to be in. I ask to speak with him and he invites me into his office. I tell him first that I want to thank him, and I feel myself start choking up a bit. I explain what happened with rent, and go on to say that if it weren't for how personally involved he was with said organization, after everything he told us at the meeting, I would never have thought to contact that organization for help. And that they told us they were going to help us, and we weren't going to be evicted after all.

This man's eyes absolutely light up, and without hesitation he pulls his chair up to mine and bear-hugs me. So naturally I start ugly crying into his shoulder as he's telling me he's so glad they could help, and he's probably gonna start crying too. Once I’ve finally calmed down enough to talk again, we just sit and chat about the organization, what happened to the employee from before, even his going so far to say that if they weren’t able to help that woman he was ready to pull out his wallet and do so.

I can't emphasize enough that I've only been here a scant few months but I really felt, especially in that moment, that this was a man who honest to god cares deeply about the well-being of his employees. And while I know it's really the charity organization that's doing the legwork, I really feel I owe it to him for being as personally invested as he is to make what would have been a rote, boring meeting into something that saved my skin.

Therinnyone,You're not going do business with me because I am trying to protect your account from fraud??? Sure. Ok.,"Obligatory ltl, ftp.

Sorry about formatting, on mobile.

As some of you may know by my post and comment history, I work for Major Canadian Mobile Retailer (I'll call them MCM for short) in Small Dumbass Town in Small Hick Province. 

This literally just happened 5 mins ago. Our company policy is we need a piece of government issued photo ID before we can pull an account. It protects you, it protects the company, it's just in everyone's best interest.

Cue bitchy lady or BL.

BL (in an obnoxiously high pitched ""I'm so perky voice!"") I'd like to see about a phone upgrade please!

Me (monotone but polite, as retail in this town has sucked out my soul forever ago): Sure, I can help with that. Do you have your ID on you?

BL (titters): Oh, yes, just out in my car! 

We stare blankly at each other for a few beats.

Me: Ok, well I'm afraid I need to see some ID before I can bring up your account. 

BL (incredulous): really?! Why?!

Me (wondering why she thinks I asked to see the damn ID in the first place): we require government issued photo identification before we bring up anyone's account, for your safety.

BL (a bit more high pitched now): but everything you need to know is on my phone!

Me: I'm sorry ma'am, we still require photo identification. Otherwise anyone who had access to or knew your information could just come in and start making changes to your account.

BL (even more high pitched now, but with a crazy smile and a bit of a psychotic laugh): well! Well this is just bad customer service!! I suppose MCM won't be getting any money from me today! Hahaha!!

Me (totally not giving 2 flying effs):  ok. Have a good evening.

BL huffs away and I immediately hop on here to share with you good folks. 

Like, seriously, why though?!? Why do people act like that? You're not giving us money this evening? All because you're too lazy to run back something that is to protect you from fraud?!

Yeah, you're really hurting me lady.",TalesFromRetail,856,1536958648
lectric_socks,"""IS THAT A NOBODY?!?""","Mobile formatting etc. 

Another tale from the cursed help desk. I work in a department store that mainly sells clothing. I work a help desk which has it's own stockroom right next to the desk. 

That room is for back of house functions like shipping different merchandise from the store to wherever it has to go. 

We usually leave the door open in case we get a customer, would rather avoid that, ""IS ANYBODY WORKING HERE?!?""  situation. 

So I'm working in the stockroom making boxes and packing up merchandise to be shipped to a warehouse. My coworker was helping until she got a customer who came up and started complaining.

She sounded like any customer who blatantly ignored our return policy, for some merchandise you only have 30 days to make a return. After 30 days for that merchandise sometimes it's no longer in the system and we can't look up the item because it's too old.  

So working in the back I just hear the same spiel over and over coming from the customer. 

""Well when did you change the policy? This is outrageous! Can't you do something just for me?? I've been a customer for 30 years! This is ridiculous I get better service at (name of competitor)""  

Tired of the broken record complaining I reached over a little and pushed the door shut. Unfortunately the door is heavy and in closing it slammed shut. 

I didn't hear the conversation that followed but, I believe my coworker to tell me the truth. 

Flinching at the sound of the door she screamed, 

""WhAT WAS THAT?!? WAS THAT A NOBODY?""

My coworker told her that her phrasing was impolite and that I was just trying to do my work without too much distraction. 

The customer continued complaining saying I should be reported to a manager. And then just again about her return. 

My coworker and I had a giggle about the whole thing after she left. ",TalesFromRetail,1345,1536929009
DeadMiner,"No, we don’t carry any 3/4 inch plugs smaller than 3/4 inches.","It’s mid-winter in a small northern town, the hardware store has slowed down predictably. A costumer strays in and says “brrrr.” We were in the middle of a bad blizzard and a long cold streak, so many of us had run out of clever ways of saying “It’s cold.”

&gt;**Me:** “Good afternoon, can I help you with anything?”

&gt;**Customer:** “Yeah.”

&gt;**Me:** “What can I help you with?”

&gt;**Customer:** “I need a 2/4 inch black pipe cap.”

&gt;**Me:** “1/2 inch black?”

&gt;**Customer:** “No, 2/4.”

&gt;**Me:** “Well it’s the same thing, just making sure we’re on the same page.”

&gt;**Customer:** “I meant 3/4 inch.”

&gt;**Me:** “That’s fine, follow me.”

We make our way over the fittings, I hand him a black 3/4 inch cap.

&gt;**Customer:** “No, this isn’t it.”

&gt;**Me:** “Well what’s wrong with it?”

&gt;**Customer:** “Everything, it’s too big, I asked for brass, and it’s supposed to go inside the pipe.

Okay, so first of all, this is why I repeat to customers what they asked for. I heard black, I said black, he didn’t argue with it. Second of all, if it goes into the pipe it’s a plug, not a cap. Admittedly I ignored the “too big” comment under the assumption that it was redundant as it would be smaller fitting in a pipe than it would be fitting around one.

I hand him a 3/4 brass plug.

&gt;**Customer:** “I told you, it’s way too big!”

&gt;**Me:** “Is it possible you meant 1/2 like you initially said, or maybe 3/8?”

&gt;**Customer:** “When I say 3/4, I mean 3/4.”

&gt;**Me:** “Well this is 3/4.”

&gt;**Customer:** “It’s too big, what don’t you get?”

&gt;**Me:** “Sir, you asked for 3/4, this is 3/4, says it right on the bag. This is what you asked for. Would you like me to show you the smaller fittings?”

&gt;**Customer:** “Are they 3/4?”

&gt;**Me:** “*No*, they’re smaller.”

&gt;**Customer:** “Then you don’t have them, what a waste of time.”

He left, and scowled when I said “Have a nice day!”

foreverstubborn,Of course that bag you want to buy is just full of your own personal belongings!,"On mobile, my apologies for any formatting weirdness.

So I worked at a thrift store about a year ago. It was a heavily regular-customer based store, and sketchy customers knew which cashiers were new and which ones were experienced. I had trained a new girl on the register, and she was running it just fine, so I let her be for a little bit. She called me up for help with a lady who wanted to buy a larger purse and our price tag had conveniently fallen off. We knew this lady, she always coincidentally fell in love with items whos tags had gone missing.

So I went up, informed the lady that I would take the purse back to our sorting/pricing room and have one of our sorters re-price it, and she handed the purse to me. It was clearly filled with something. She said, ""Oh, I was making sure everything from my current purse would fit, nothing sketchy!"" Right, ok. I smiled at her and said I'd be right back.

Got to the back room and we opened the purse. Surprise! Packs of underwear, several pairs of sunglasses, and a scarf are stuffed inside, all tagged. No personal belongings. We priced the purse, and I carried the previously concealed merchandise in one arm/hand and the purse on my other coming back to the floor. 

The new cashier looked like she was trying to keep a straight face talking to the lady when she saw me coming, and when the lady turned around she was immediately feigning shock. I asked her ""Would you like these? I found them inside it while we quality checked the interior"". She said no, and mumbled something about how we probably didn't have to quality check the entire purse. 

Amazingly, she whipped her wallet out of her own still-full purse to pay. 

TL;DR: Lady assumes she can rip a tag off a purse for it to be re-priced cheaper with a new cashier, stuffs it with other merch she intends to steal, tries to convince employees that she tested putting her own belongings in it yet hands it off while it's still obviously stuffed (supposedly with personal valuables) and is surprised she is found out.

Evergreen1996,Sir you didn't specify,"So a few years ago when I was still at school I had a part time job at a grocery/takeaway shop. I used to work starting from 4:30 on a Saturday and the first thing I would do is pack up the sandwich ingredients as we stopped making sandwiches from 4:30. 
One shift this man came in one night at about 7 and wanted a sandwich and brought a note with all the ingredients he wanted on them. 
I asked the kitchen staff telling her I was more than happy to tell him we had put all the sandwich ingredients away but she agreed to anyway. So sandwich's made paid for and I put the note away and got on with my shift. 
About twenty minutes later I get a phone call from said customer

M) hi this is... how can I help you?

C)  I want to make a complaint I came in earlier for a sandwich and you left the egg off this is unacceptable I expect better than this. 

M)  sir I'm sorry about this if you come in tomorrow I will make a note and they can give you a refund 

C)  good I'll will definitely be coming in to get a refund 

Then I hung and thought for a moment that I didn't remember reading egg on the list so I find the note and low and behold he had not written it down on the list. 
So I wrote a note for the staff the next day 
explaining the situation and taping the note he had written to it and finished my shift went home and didn't think much of it. 

The next day on my day off at about lunch while hanging out with my friends I get a call from work from a new staff member clearly flustered telling me that a man had come in for a refund and she couldn't give it to him and he had DEMANDED that the staff member that was on last night to come in!! I couldn't believe he had the gall to demand I come into work on my day off but I went in because I was close by and I wanted to help out my Co worker who was clearly freaking out. 

Walking in I see he's pissed so putting on my best retail voice (you know the one)  

M)  hi sir what seems to be the problem?

C) I came in to get a sandwich and you got the order wrong and now won't give me a refund  this is unacceptable blah blah 

M) (with my best smile) I grabbed the note he wrote: as you can see here sir on the note you wrote you never actually put down egg therefore as we were not at fault in this situation we can't actually give you a refund I'm sorry sir. 

His face changed from pissed off to sheepish so fast and he quietly leaves.

IL- can you guys quit hovering over me? It’s kind of annoying. (Keep in mind, I really wasn’t paying her a bit of attention.)

Me and coworker exchange looks, because what?

IL keeps scanning, doesn’t say anything else until coworker walks off. 

IL- don’t you have anything better to do? Your desk is up there. If you’re going to stand there and hover you might as well do it for me. 

So I told her I was just doing my job. Oh no, that didn’t sit well with her. 

IL- you’re treating me like a criminal I haven’t done anything wrong! Get me your manager!

So of course to humor her, I did. While waiting for my manager, a random employee walks by. She proceeds to complain about how rude I am and demands they do something. Employee says the same thing I told her- “she’s just doing her job.”

Manager shows up, and says the same thing. IL pays, storms out, and proceeds to say “I won’t ever shop her again!”

I work as a retail deli manager and while I have had my fair share of rude customers, this particular interaction was uniquely frustrating. I am a very helpful person and, despite not knowing where every item in the store is located yet, am always willing to help a customer find what they are looking for.

I was stocking my salesfloor case when I overheard a lady proclaim loudly for all to hear, *""I hate this store, I can never find what I'm looking for!""*

Now's my chance! I stop what I'm doing and turn toward the customer and say to her, over a display, ""Hi, what are you looking for?""

Silence.

Okay, I thought maybe she didn't hear me or didn't see me since there was a display between us. She turned into the main aisle and passed right by me and I said, ""Excuse me, what can I help you find?""

Silence.

The lady, followed by her younger daughter and teenage daughter turn down the aisle directly across from me and the daughter stops and yells back at her mom, ""Hey, he's trying to help!"" The lady ignores her daughter and keeps walking. 

The daughter turns to me and I can see her soul dying. She starts to say, ""we're looking for..."" then, from down the aisle, Satan herself snarls,

*""COME ON""*

The daughter, her soul having fully departed her body leaving nothing but a husk behind says to me, ""I'm so sorry"" and she turns and follows her mom.

zippouix,"""I'll just take my business elsewhere!"" Please do!","For background, I work at a locally owned wine store. A few weeks ago I posted here about obnoxious people trying to buy alcohol even though one of them did not have an ID. In my state, everyone in the party must have an ID in order to buy alcohol. If an employee gets caught selling to someone under 21, both the business and the employee get fined hundreds or thousands of dollars, the employee gets fired, and the store could lose their liquor license. 

Last night at work, two women came up to the register to buy a few bottles of liquor. I'll be ""M"", customer 1 will be ""RB"" for rude bitch, and customer 2 will be ""YL"" for younger lady. 

M: Hello, can I just see both of your IDs?

RB handed me her license (she was like 35) and YL told me she would have to go to the car to get hers. 

RB: Well she can just leave the store and you can sell this to me.

RB then follows YL out of the store and comes back in. I tell her that I need to see YL's ID in order to sell the alcohol. 

RB: I told her to stay in the car. 

M: Well, in order to sell this to you, she needs to be in here with her ID. 

RB: Are you kidding me?! But she's 23!   
M: I am not. Sorry, it's state law. 

RB: You have a choice here. Either you sell me this alcohol or I'll take my business elsewhere. 

For a second I just stared at her because I couldn't believe that she thought I would care. 

M: Okay, well I'm not going to sell this to you. 

RB: FINE! I'll just go down the road! 

M: Okay. 

A few minutes later, both women came back in. At this point, my manager had come to the front to void the sale. YL asked if she could show us a picture of her license. We told her that we couldn't accept that. They left again, RB in a huff. A customer who witnessed most of this told us that there were 4 cop cars parked down the road, so it was good that we didn't sell to them.

MissAcedia,Stealing old lady doubles down,"So this was originally a comment on another post about the first time I caught this woman stealing but YESTERDAY SHE CAME BACK AND TRIED IT AGAIN because \[insert quote about ""insanity"" here\].

&amp;#x200B;

So for some background: I work at a spa and one of our clients is this old lady that has been coming to one of the owners for her nails since the dawn of time.  She's at least in her 70s and is a royal pain in the ass because she ALWAYS comes in at least 30 mins late... we literally have to tell her her appointment is at 4 when it's actually 3:30.  The owner has let her get away with it for so long that she just does it regularly now.  We don't usually care because it only wastes the owner's time.  Then after her last appointment I caught her stealing a bottle of hair product right off the display counter in front of me.  She had already paid for her service, waited until my coworker and I got busy at the desk, then walked it over to our sitting area where her purse was, put it in and zipped it up.  In shock I confronted her where she tried to play dumb then insisted she just wasn't paying attention and was going to ask how much it was.  Riiiiiiiiiiiiiight.  I told both the owners.  The one thinks she's just senile and the other who does her services does not.  I thought in horror how she usually spends a good 20 minutes puttering around our retail area after every appointment and wonder how much stuff she has made off with.  The owner decided to just watch her going forward so I alerted the front desk to watch her like a hawk. 

&amp;#x200B;

FF to yesterday which was her first appointment since the one where I caught the client (C) stealing.  After her appointment she started her typical tour of the retail area to look and touch and open everything and anything with a small open-topped bag on her arm.  We were busy at the desk so I asked my coworker (S) to ""tidy the retail shelves"" with a quick whispered explanation as to why.  S grabbed a rag and proceeded to clean shelves while shadowing C like it was specifically what we were paying her for.  She proceeded to customer service the SHIT out of C, volunteering information on each of the products, answering C's hundreds of questions, etc.  I kid you not this woman ""shopped"" for FORTY-FIVE MINUTES.  Poor S was worn out from her questions but the retail area has never looked cleaner.  C sighed and told us at the desk ""I can't shop today but I did look, bye!"" She ALMOST got to the front door but got distracted by our display of expensive leather purses.  S looked like she had just gotten back in the trenches only to be barked at to get back out there and proceeded to start ""dusting"" the desk next to the purses.  C must have taken down every single purse, looked at the price tag (several hundred dollars each) and put them back.  I looked away for a second to answer a question from another coworker and heard S squeak: ""C!  You have one of our purses!""  I whipped my head around and there's C with one foot out the door with one of the smaller purses tucked under her arm.  I came around the desk to take it from her and put it back and she puts her hand on my arm and goes ""you MUST watch me my dear, my memory is not so good!"" Yeah ok then.

&amp;#x200B;

I start showing her the sale bags when I happen to look in her bag and see a brand new travel makeup brush... the exact brand we carry.  I know we have some of these in kits... kits she was looking in. I tell her I'm just going to see if we have any more sale purses in the back (so she doesn't leave) and I rush over to the makeup kits and sure enough one is missing a travel brush. I came back over with the kit in hand and tell her ""C, you have one of our travel brushes in your bag."" She proceeds to put on a very shitty ""oh what do you mean??!"" show as I pull out the brush.  She then says by far the dumbest excuse for stealing I've ever heard:

&amp;#x200B;

C: Oh it must have fallen in my bag when I opened the kit.

&amp;#x200B;

OH OK THAT SOUNDS COMPLETELY PLAUSIBLE /s  It would have sounded 2% less bullshitty if she hadn't then wandered over to another set of travel brushes and said ""oh I need some of those but I can't afford it right now.""  Like do you expect me to go ""oh ok then steal it from us, totally ok!!""

emilymckenziee,MY CUT FLOWERS WON'T GROW!,"Guys, this literally happened today. I don't think I can face these lunatics anymore. I manage a floral shop inside a retail chain ( a lot of people in the floral industry like to give me crap for this, but I get to do what I love, I'm paid well, have great benefits, and I get to do weddings/ event work on weekends). So I get a lot of strange or dumb questions, but this was so beyond crazy.

A young woman ( mid 20s)  is  browsing my department with what I'm guessing were her mother and grandmother.  They spot some Gladiolus and are discussin.  The younger woman starts yelling 
YW:"" Hey! Hey! These flowers! I bought these flowers here last year and they didn't come back this year?"" ( the older women are shaking their heads in agreement)
Me: You bought Gladiola bulbs? This past winter was extremely harsh, a lot of people have perennials that didn't return."" 
YW: If I plant these. Will they come back?  
Me: I am actually out of Gladiola bulbs, but yes they will come back. But if we have a long, rough winter it might affect them. 
YW: NO THESE! 
Me: You planted those? Those are cut flowers... 
YW: You just said they were bulbs. They will turn into bulbs next year. 
Me: ( Dumbfounded) I... No.. You have to plant the bulb and the flower grows. 
YW: So, can I plant these?! 
Me: ( Giving up on life) ..no.

MamaBear1109,It's FINE jewelry....,"Hey guys, FTP LTL mobile formatting etc....

I am currently employed by the a popular American department store (think red) as an office admin/jack of all trades (I've worked for the company for 6 years, and I've held a lot of titles). Mostly though, I'm an admin now, with a little of the other stuff as necessary.

Characters in the story (read: *charade*):

Me = myself of course
CW = coworker
FJL = Fine jewelery lady
SL = Sales lead
OPM = Operations manager

All set? Alright, let's go.

So my office is on the highest floor in the building, behind the home department. As I'm walking in for the day, CW stops me and tells me the tale of FJL from last night. Apparently FJL had made a purchase on the first floor in the fine jewelry department,  and then brought said jewelry to the home department to look for towels. FJL subsequently handed her purchase to her hubby to hold onto while looking at towels. Hubby puts the item down, and like many a customer, the couple walks away leaving the precious item behind. When they come back to find it, it's mysteriously disappeared! CW also lets me know that FJL paid CASH. I take the name and number CW so graciously recorded, and add it to the lost and found log in the office.

So for anyone who does not work or know fine jewelry, we're talking pieces that can range from $100 to $10,000 plus. So when we hear someone has lost fine jewelry, we'll do out best, but it's probably been picked up and walked out with its new owner, Mr. Thief.

The American department store has a bang-up return policy which says if you have the receipt, we will return the item for you, using the method you paid with (SHE PAID CASH *facepalm*). Starting to see why we take the fine jewelry seriously? 

So, I set up my office, get my trainees started, and the phone rings. It's from one of the Sales Leads.

SL: MamaBear, I have a customer on the 2nd floor saying she lost a necklace from fine jewelry. Has anything come up to you?

Me: No, and I have her information, so if it does come up to the office, we will call her.

SL: Alright, I'll let her know. Thanks.

You'd think that was the end of it.... Wouldn't you?

Now, I have 2 trainees and 4 sales associates in my office wanting supplies, oh and I forgot to say that I'm by myself. In other words, I'M EFFING BUSY, and wish there were three of me at that moment. The phone rings again. This time it's a coworker from the first floor.

CW: Hi MamaBear, I have a customer down here looking for a fine jewelry purchase

Me: *silent inner scream of frustration* Is her name FJL, and her phone number 123-456-7890?

CW: Yep, that's her.

Me: It has not been brought up to me in the last 5 minutes, if it comes up I will call her.

CW: *silence* Is the store manager here?

Side note: I don't know how many of you wonderful readers work in department stores, but have you ever noticed that customers and coworkers seem to believe they are the gods of retail miracles? Like, talking to the store manager will make the precious package reappear before your very eyes! 

Me: No, store manager won't be back until tomorrow.

CW: Oh, well then, is OPM here? I suggested that maybe OPM could track the purchase using our cameras and see where they left it at?

Me: *Inner dualogue containing words that cannot be said to coworkers* Tell you what, I'll ask him, because it's a fine jewelry purchase.

So, to make a horrifyingly long story short (I am so sorry other retail working readers), I call the OPM, he goes down to the FJL and brings her back to the office. 

Now the OPM is a friend, and so he comes in, asks for a customer apology coupon (*eyeroll* you lost it lady, why are we apologizing?), and the final straw comes out. 

OPM: So, I'm looking for the transaction, how much did you say the final cost was? 

FJL: Oh, $12.74, it was a real deal down from $100! 

Me: *jaw hits floor, vision goes red*

OPM: Yeah that's a great deal! Well, let's go see if we can't get that purchase again with the customer apology coupon, huh? 

And they walk out of the office all smiley, while I feel a wicked tension headache brewing behind my eyes.... And I still had 4 hours and two trainees to go.... 

TD;LR: Lady loses fine jewelry purchase, seems to be in a panic and uses coworkers and associates on all 3 floors, seriously putting a kink in my work flow. When finally helped by OPM, it comes out that the ""fine jewelry"" actually was less than $15, and we give her a $25 apology coupon to rebuy.

LegitLogia,I know now to never use your service again!!,"Mobile, sorry for the formatting.

I work on calls dealing with customer orders and queries, though I get a tonne of complaints too. I had this interaction today with a particularly irate customer that didn't seem to understand what she had done wrong. I'm me (Me) and she'll be customer (C).

Me: Hello, CompanyName, how can I help?

C: Are you not serving me?

Me: Excuse me?

C: One of your members of staff has been horrible 
towards me and I think they have put in a false complaint about me.

At this point I notice that she's been blacklisted from our company, so I check what was written in the reasons

Me: Yes the number you're ringing from is blacklisted, bear with me one second and I'll just find out why for you. (I was giving her the benefit of the doubt here as I don't know any of the on site staff) 

C: Well it's f*cking disgusting that he was able to do this when I've done nothing wrong and he's been horrible to me, whatever he's said isn't true AT ALL.

Me: The member of staff you're talking about actually had nothing to do with you being blacklisted. It says here the reason is that you called us regarding this issue and were abusive to the member of staff on the phone, issuing threats to on site staff and insulting my colleague.

C: Well yes, I did but the guy in the store was threatening me too! Obviously I'm not just going to sit back and take that (so she decides to ring a completely different person to argue with??) I'm going to threaten him back. Besides, Im going to take this to the police and put in a proper complaint that's all I was calling for.

Me: That's perfectly fine, it's well within your rights to do both of those and we'd be happy to help in any way possible, but you have to understand that you can't be calling us issuing threats and giving abuse to staff who are trying to help you.

C: What so now I've been blacklisted because your staff were threatening me and I've called to complain? WOW WHAT GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. It's clear that you don't care about your staff and what they do.

Me: As I've already told you, and you confirmed, you're blacklisted for issuing threats and being abusive to staff, not for wanting to put in a complaint.

C: Well that's that then, wait until the police and newspapers hear about how you don't care about your staff threatening customers, now I know to never use your service again.

Me: You wouldn't be able to use our services anyway seeing as you've been blacklisted. 

C: YOU CHEEKY LITTLE- 

I hung up here, got a bit cheeky at the end but I was tired from a long shift and didn't want to entertain her any more. She seemed to just be looking for an argument and for somebody to agree with her and apologise, luckily the management where I work doesn't blindly favour the customer in every situation and is actually more on the fair side.",TalesFromRetail,855,1536073047

It was a normal day, busy but not crazy, maybe a line of 6-8 people (we had a few people on so it wasn't bad) and I paused to take a moment before calling over the next person, right before I do, this older man holding a belt calls me from the entrance of the line.

He immediately started to lift up the line divider to go under, I quickly open hand point to the line and say 'sir there is a line, please line up.' he looks at the line, who are all looking at him, and proceeds to continue to climb under and begins to step towards me, I repeat, in a louder, sterner voice 

Me: ""SIR, THERE IS A LINE""

He walks, not back under the line divider, but into the line to make his way back to the back of the line. I watch him do this, my 'I'm so fucking done with this what the fuck' face coming out.

Balmas,If only there were a way to indicate we're closed...,"The gas station I manage is having technical difficulties, and IT instructs me that for them to reset the pumps, none of the pumps can be active. As such, I string a line of traffic cones and police tape across the entrance to the gas station, and wait for people to leave. For information's sake, our gas station has a one-way arrangement: come in one entrance, funnel out one exit. Both are clearly marked with ""Enter here"" and ""Exit only! Do not Enter!""

&amp;#x200B;

People trickle out one by one, and I eventually give the IT guy the go-ahead to reset the station.

To clear the circumstances, my mum has a small store, which is basically half art gallery, half antiquity store (mostly art nouveau jewellery and glass). She runs the shop all by herself, so if she runs an errand I sometimes watch the store so that she doesn't have to close it during the day. 

So a couple walks in and she asks about a set of jewellery she saw in the window consisting of golden earrings, a golden necklace and a golden ring, all in very good condition and beautifully crafted, all of them with rubies and the necklace even with a small diamond. I try to find out the prices as they are all listed separately and the system to register jewellery is a bit chaotic. She proceeds to tell me that it would be so much better if I gave it to her at a good price to be admired instead of lying around in the store and so on. As I've just found the price of the earrings she flips over the box with the set in it, she will be Al for American lady, I will be me.

Al:""Here, I think we've found our price"" *points to the bottom of the box* 

~the price was 20€ or something~

Me:""Madam, I think that is the price of the box alone, I just found the price of the earrings which is 175€ and they are most likely the cheapest object here so 700 is probably a low estimate for the whole set.""

Al:""But you can give me a discount if I buy it whole, right?""

In our produce department is our selection of kombucha, coconut water, lemonade, tea, and protein shakes. We have two different brands of protein shakes, one which is quite cheap and one that is much more expensive. (Cheap brand of protein shake will be “X”, expensive brand will be “Y”). The same lady comes in every week and buys about 10 bottles of X protein shake. However, we had a really bad truck mixup this past week and the products we ordered got delivered to a different store while we got their products. Also, X brand of protein shake was on sale last week so it sold out. Obviously that means we are going to be very short on stock for the week. Cue entrance of Lady (L) who wants her protein shakes.

L: I’m sorry sir but do you happen to have any more of X protein shake?

Me: No ma’am, they were on sale last week and we had a product mixup, we will not be selling that shake this week, i’m terribly sorry for the inconvenience.

L: Oh well can you all hold me a box of them when you get them?

Me: Of course ma’am. I know you come in quite often so if you’d like, i can offer you Y brand shake for the same price of X brand.

L: Sure, can i see what it tastes like?

Me: Sure, i can run and grab you a sampling cup out of the back room really fast just give me one moment.

L: Oh, i don’t need it.

Lady then pulls Y shake off the shelf, opens it, takes a massive gulp, puts the cap back on and sets it back on the shelf.

L: That was terrible! Why would you ever offer me that?

Me: I’m sorry you didn’t like it ma’am but because you opened it and drank from it you have to pay for it. If you buy more i’d be happy to give you the reduced price.

L: This is all your fault! Why did you mix up your products like that?! You should know better!

Lady then proceeds to walk over to customer service and asks for a manager. My manager explains to her the situation and that she still has to buy the bottle that she opened. She storms out the door without paying for the protein shake and writes an online complaint about me which goes straight to corporate and i have a meeting with someone from corporate tomorrow evening to talk about my actions.

cpazynski,Demanding A Employee Discount,"So I work in a very busy drug store in a rather large city. I recently had a customer come in and as I was ringing her up I asked for her membership card. To which she replies “yeah I actually know an employee, could you give me her discount?” (Our employee discount is linked to our membership card). This is also a pretty big no as only family is suppose to use the discount. When I explained to her that if she knows this employees phone number she can enter it on the keypad, but I can’t just give her a discount, she got pretty upset. “I’m here all the time and the other employees always bypass the phone number for me. So I know you can just type the discount in for me.” 
My manager notices the commotion and comes to see what was happening. This also happens to be the same manager that the customer was just asking about applying for a position in the pharmacy with. The customer then started once again asking for a free discount, that she didn’t earn, on this merchandise. “You guys know *****, she works here, I want to use her discount.” My manager then proceeds to explain that this is grounds for termination for the employee. And the customer once again asks for the discount! Eventually she understood that we are not going to give it to her and she leaves. The employee ended up getting fired, because this isn’t the first time she’s given away her discount to whoever. And the customer did not get the position in our store.

You see, we have a deal where if you buy a reusable bag we'll give you a discount. There is one particular design that *is* marked down to 50 cents, but the other 5 are not. Unfortunately, I had a bad feeling where this was going.

hppiefrk,Oh what a difference half an inch makes.,"So woman and her husband come to meat dept. Friday morning.  She was so upset she was literally *shaking*.  Apparently on Thursday night she had come in and asked for 1 1/2"" steaks, and the seafood guy (who is located just outside meat dept. and runs interference for us when we're busy) told her that the steaks she had were an inch and a half.  Which wasn't true, after we looked, the were like maybe slightly over an inch.  But she kept going on and on about 'how poorly they were cut' and 'they weren't and inch and a half' and 'nobody would cut her inch and a half steaks' (which seafood guy said she never asked - he admitted fault being off by 3/8"").  So she brought them back.

Another meat cutter goes back and cuts her 6 steaks at an inch and a half.  After listening to her go on and on and on about these 'not inch and a half steaks', actually SHAKING because she was so upset, he took great care to cut her exactly 1 1/2"" steaks.

Upon bringing out and presenting, she said oh, no....these are way too big.  I don't want to spend that much, why are they so much more? Why are they so BIG? I don't want these!  Uh, because you have an extra 3"" of steaks, that's why.  He finally said go pick out a pack of steaks that are the 'right size' and I'll cut another 6.  She picks out a *fucking pack of one inch steaks*, identical to the ones she originally had.  Her husband looked at his feet the whole time.

The kicker to the whole incident?  At the dept. manager weekly meeting later that day, our store manager read us a complaint from corporate that had come in that morning...it began ""The seafood guy LIED to me, I wanted inch and a half steaks...""

So now we're stuck with 6 (perfectly good) steaks that she brought back (Shrink - left the store) and 6 big steaks that she made us cut (harder sell at our particular store where the clientele is thrifty), and complaints from corporate....all for her to end up with the same fucking steaks she had in the first place.  Some people are just absolutely nuts with their first world problems.  Are your perceived 'wrong size steaks' actually enough to warrant literal shaking with upsetness, complaints to corporate, and complaining to everyone from the meat dept to customer service to the store manager?

cardiacman,"""Can we return our unused alcohol?"" ""Sure, you can return your unused ALCOHOL""","So this is a story with half of it completed from one of my co-workers in our instore liquor shop.


On mobile, excuse any format issues etc.


So I get a call from a customer asking if they can return unused wine/beer/spirts from an event they had. 


This call arrives after our liquor store has closed for the night, so I can't pass the customer on to them. But this sounds like it was a very large shop, upwards of a thousand dollars worth of booze.


I tell the customer that there shouldn't be any issues returning unwanted alcohol provided they had proof of purchase. They ensure me they do and that they will be in the store tomorrow. Pretty standard stuff.


Now for part two, which I did not witness. (I'll keep it in first person for simplicity)


Two customers come into the store with two trollies (shopping carts) packed full of wine bottles, beer slabs and a few vodka bottles.


They explained there here for a return and we start scanning the returns in. Then I noticed something strange about one of the wine bottles. The aluminium cap/lid seems to have being drawn on with a permanent marker.


This raises my suspicions so I look a little closer. They have drawn over the little aluminium tabs that break off when the bottle lid is twisted off. This bottle has been opened, and been drawn on to try to conceal that fact.


I look at the customers, but they are both avoiding eye contact. I give the bottle a little twist, and it opens easily without the sound of snapping tabs. They are watching me now, guilt trying to be hidden from their faces.


With the most polite tone I can manage I say 
&gt;""excuse me, but is there any possibility this bottle could have been opened?""

Their faces go red, and they admit it was opened without any further pushing. Then as I'm explaining that we can't return opened products, something else catches my attention. This wine doesn't smell. There is only a very weak hint of alcohol.

I raise the lip of the bottle to my nose and sniff. Under the weak residual alcohol smell, the cool metallic smell of our cities water.

Wordlessly, I reach across and pick up one of our tasting glasses, pour myself a glass and take a sip. Water. The bottle has not just been opened, but refilled with water.

Through a retail smile I say 
&gt;""Are there any other products here that might have potentially been opened, and subsequently filled with water?""

Turns out, the only products that weren't tampered with were the beer slabs. The vodka and all of the white wines were all opened and refilled.

The customers denied doing it themselves, saying that it must have been the bar attendants they hired.

At our managers request in the name of customer service, we return their slabs, keep the other items and ask that they take greater care and responsibility next time.

We submitted a report to our loss prevention team, but sadly never heard anything about it.

NL-Frosty,Customer throws a fit during an emergency call.,"Hello TFR! This story was inspired by u/meganwendy and her customer interaction! This is my first post here, LTL, on mobile etc... 


So to start off some background info. I live in Sweden and an a part time employee at ""Certain Supermarket"" this chain works like a franchising business, there's a store owner and no real managers. 


Now the store is located in a rather small city, but during summer we get a lot of customers. Our revenue usually increases by 5-6x. 


My friend and co-worker will be CW, rude lady will be RL. 
Now it might be worth mentioning that both CW and I were high school students. I'd been working there for 4 years already and knew the owner and all other employees really well, my parents are also regulars. 


CW, who at the time was an extra hire for the summer and was working the quick checkout, got a call via the work phone from her mum about her dad being hospitalized for unknown reasons. 


As she called me over to take her place by the checkout RL breaks out of line and angrily goes up to her and starts yelling at her for wasting time and work ethics blah blah etc... Mind you RL was 3rd or 4th in line. 


As my friend was about to start tearing up I politely asked please get back in line and not to be rude to other employees. RL then starts yelling at me and throwing a fit about how rude we were and how this store would be out of business without her. 


Now I like to think of myself as quite calm and collected but this time I didn't have any of it and started arguing with her which ended with her wanting to see a ""manager"". I said sure and as I was about to call the owner he and another regular employee rushed to the scene. 


Just as RL was about to throw a fit to the owner he interrupted her and angrily told her off while the other employee took CW away. He pretty much told RL the same thing I'd told her minutes earlier and to either let it be or leave. Everytime she tried to interfere he would cut her short and defend us. So eventually she quietly went back into line. 


In the mean time I had gone to the checkout since a queue had been forming. Since this was the quick checkout, meaning 7 or less items, it didn't take more than 2 minutes for her to reach the front of the line, with a FULL CART! As I smiled and happily told her that this was a quick checkout it looked like she was about to throw a fit again I smiled and said ""please"" as I pointed to the regular checkouts. She muttered something and left for the other checkout. 



It's moments like these I really appreciate working at ""Certain supermarket"" and under said owner.

Dianchie,I Don’t Think That’s The Price,"So the store I work in sells mugs and other drink accessories. We sell other stuff but this is one of our core products. We sell fine bone china mugs as well. This woman and her husband come in looking for a gift. They see a Dunoon fine bone mug with dogs on it. The husband is wandering aimlessly around the store so he doesn’t witness the interaction but he seems perfectly nice.

So I’m packing up her order and the mug is $33 before taxes. It’s made in Dunoon, Scotland so that’s where the price comes from. I take off the sticker and put it in the box. Sticker goes in garbage. We have a screen that faces the customer so they can see the total.

She will be DL (Dunoon Lady) and I will be Me

Me: So for the biscotti, tea towel, and mug, your total is $56.79

DL: I *DON’T* believe the mug is $32.95. 

*I run over to the Dunoon stand and get a similar mug from the same line and show her the price tag*

Me: Unfortunately that’s the last wiener dog mug but the French bulldog one is from the same line. It is also $32.95 before taxes

DL: *starts pulling the mug she picked out of the box* Why did you take the price tag off? I NEVER ASKED YOU TO DO THAT

Me: I apologize ma’am. As per store policy, we remove price stickers for gift items

DL: I NEVER ASKED YOU TO REMOVE IT

Me: I’m sorry. I threw it away already

DL: WELL GO GET IT! NOW!!

*The tag is thankfully at the top of the garbage and I hand it to her*

Me: So the total is $56.79

DL: *triumphantly sticks the price sticker to the inside of her bag* Goodbye! I will be calling your manager about this!",TalesFromRetail,917,1535681646
HoneyBadger162,I unintentionally sold a woman some headphones over a joke,"So this was a few months back, but it goes like this:

It was late in the afternoon, and i'm tidying around the store, i'm on an aisle with all the stationery items (Pens, pencils, folders, you name it...Oh and some headphones, don't ask me why they were there, they just were), and a coworker was on the other side, trying to tidy the top shelf and placing items on it. He knocks over some headphones on my aisle (Thankfully, not ontop of me), so I go there, pick 'em up and plop them right back on the shelf.  

So a couple minutes later, a woman comes onto my aisle, so I crack a joke 
&gt;""Hey watch out for these headphones, they're attacking people today it seems""  

That made her laugh, which is nice. She stops and looks at them and says 
&gt;""Actually, I was looking for some headphones for my kids""  

So, I slide over to her and immediately start looking around on the top shelf, since they were kids headphones, and they had different themes (spider man, despicable me, you get the idea), in the end she took a couple of the headphones, and we had a good laugh over how I just basically managed to sell her some headphones, and was quite happy with it all, amazingly, she even went out of her way to tell one of the other members of staff about how good I was. Not a manager, but, hey, I can't complain.  

And to think, I made someones night better, by telling them a joke and then selling them some headphones unintentionally, kinda put a big grin on my face, it's the little things that can sometimes make the job better.",TalesFromRetail,1744,1535636444
kkkaaasss,“What do you mean you can’t help me?!”,"Hi all, obligatory ‘sorry for the formatting, on mobile!’

TLDR; at the bottom!


So I work at a retail store that specializes in men’s &amp; boy’s clothing, and we’re very busy because school is starting soon so everyone is buying ‘back to school’ clothes. 

I was helping out a mother and her two kids who were very needy, the boys’ DID NOT want to be shopping and their mom did not want to put up with their attitude. No one was happy but I was trying my best to make the experience easier so that way they could leave. 

Finally after what seemed like hours I got them to the registers, they thanked me for my time and they were on their way. Thank God. 

When I was off work I went to an office supply store close to the mall to buy some things that I needed for the store. When I was shopping I felt on my shoulder, when I turned around I saw that it was the mother and the two boys from earlier. Crazy mother is CM, and I am M. 

M: “Oh hi! Funny running into you here haha”

CM: “Where do they keep the folders?”

I try not to roll my eyes. 

M: “I’m sorry I have no clue, I feel like they’d be with the bin-“

CM: “What do you mean you have no clue you should know!”

M: “I’m sorry ma’am, I’m not familiar with this stor-“

I get cut off, AGAIN.

CM: “THAT’S SO UNPROFESSIONAL HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW?!”

M: “This isn’t my store. I do not work here” 

CM: “Yes I know that but aren’t these stores the same thing?!”

M: “No? I’m sorry but I can’t help you, have a good night.”

CM: “WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN’T HELP ME?! YOU’RE A RETAIL WORKER! YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW THESE THINGS! ALL THESE GODDAMN STORES ARE THE SAME”

At this point an employee came up to help her and she was shouting about how retail workers and stupid and rude etc. 

TDLR; I helped a customer at my store, she expected my help at a different store while I was shopping.

thumbelinax8,Almost cried today,"It was about an hour away from the store closing and I was checking out customers groceries and what not. Then an older man came through my line and he asked me what I had planned for the night. Told him that I was going to go home and do homework, that i'm getting my Masters in Early Childhood Education, and continued ringing up. Nothing out of the ordinary. Checkout time comes around and his order is $50 something and he hands me $80. I went to give him the extra 20 and he told me it was for me.

This random guy who had absolutely no reason to do so gave me his own hard-earned money. I had no idea how to react,  I was shocked and almost ready to cry because I only have like $15 in my account and just been very stressed and anxious lately.

Customer comes up and wants to buy a new lawnmower.

&gt; Me: ""Sure, let me see if we have any in stock."" ""Um...looks like that floor model is the last one we have. You'll have to wait till the next truck comes in to get one in a box.""

&gt; Guy: ""What kind of discount are you offering on this one? It has a scratch on the side."" 

Mind you this scratch was less than an inch in length on something that is going to be used exclusively outside. Cutting grass, hitting sticks, scraping against landscaping, etc. 

&gt; Me: ""We aren't taking any money off this one. It is brand new and has never been used. We can always just place an order for a new one for you.

&gt; Guy: ""Well my other one broke and I need a lawnmower! 

&gt; Me: ""I can show you these models (more expensive), you can place an order, or take this one."" 

&gt; Guy: [Huffs] ""I'll just take this one. I can't believe you guys can't take any money off for this scratch. Can you at least throw in some oil?""

&gt; Me: ""Sure!""

Note: All lawnmowers come with oil straight from the box. I just took it out and handed it to him separately so he thought he gamed the system. He was then pleased.

BeautyNoBeast,"The quicker you tell me what you want, the less embarrassing it will be.","So over the summer I worked 3rd shift in a gas station in my hometown, so I knew a lot of the people that came in. One of my favorite interactions was as follows.

I was in the middle of some boring cleaning chore or another when the little chime rang out letting me know the front doors had opened. I walked back to the counter to find my cousin waiting. The moment he sees me his face drops and I can tell what's coming.  

Now I should mention at my gas station we keep small, easy to steal things behind the counter such as lighters, 5 hour energy, and... condoms.

MC: Hey, could I get....(here he trailed off and I honestly couldn't hear him.)

Me: Sorry what? 

He just gives me the death glare for making him repeat the dreaded phrase.

MC: I said... could I get a box of condoms?

We have a few different kinds so I walk back and ask him which kind he wants.

MC: just grab a box, I dont care what kind. 

So I check him out and, while I have remained extremely professional and tried really hard not to laugh at him or make him feel even more awkward, as I handed him the bag I said my usual ""have a good night.""

Omissionsoftheomen,Diamond Encrusted Misery aka Please Don’t Cry in the Store (spoiler: he cried in the store),"There’s been requests for more tales from my days of diamond dealing, and I’m happy to oblige...

The jewellery store I worked in was luxurious to the max. Engagement rings started at $5k, and honestly, at that size, you could barely see the stone. Most rings were $13k and up.

Anyway, enter a young guy, probably late 20’s. Explains he needs a ring, is going to propose to the love of his life... it sound sweet but something about him just seemed... off.

He finds a ring he likes for $7k. I ask how he wants to pay, and he explains he needs it financed. Ok, no problem. Fill out the credit app, pop it through the system... declined. 

We start the process to appeal the decline, and he asks to use the phone to call his girlfriend. I hand him the phone, and he sits at the bridal counter to make the call. I’m about 3 feet away.

Of course, I can only hear his end, but it went like this:

“Hi Honey!

(pause)

...it’s Jim.

I just need to talk to you. I’m getting the ring you like...

(he gets cut off mid sentence by a voice I can hear getting louder.)

But I just thought we could talk...

(more loud talking)

I know, but...”

I heard the phone click and realized he’d been hung up on. 

Honestly, I was going to slink away so he could leave without anymore embarrassment, but as soon as he made eye contact, the whole story came flooding out as he cried, loudly.

They’d met online and gone out a few times but then she had gotten really busy and they didn’t see each other as much.

So he had tried to surprise her at work but her boss was soooooo strict that he couldn’t get into the office building.

He knew they were perfect for each other, but her friends were totally interfering and that’s why she wasn’t talking to him. 

So he was going to buy her a ring and surprise her at her house! 

Holy Delusions Batman.

The worst part was he was not even deterred. He asked if the credit had gone through and I politely asked him to leave, to which he said he would get cash and come back. 

I really hope that girl changed her number.

nicocacolaaa,Attack of the Serial Returner,"Inspired by “Just Do the Return!”... reminded me of my own story

I work in a small clothing chain based in the Midwest.  We’re big enough to have a system that records customer information, which is used to mail out coupons. We can’t look up customers’ “rewards points” or anything like that.   About a year and a half ago, our system update began allowing us to look up receipts from previous purchases under the customers’ names, but it’s a pain to use- we use it sparingly and still require a receipt for cash back. 

So our most infamous serial returner, who returns something from absolutely every purchase, comes in with a box of winter boots, about a month ago.  She doesn’t have a receipt, which means I can only give her store credit for whatever they scan for. I tell her this much.  They’re originally $110, so I think she had high hopes.   They scan for $32.99.  She’s upset, actually looks like she might cry.  “But they were originally $110!”  ...sorry.   She decides to keep them, and leaves. 

Fast forward to about a week ago!  As soon as I see her come through our door, I know she’s going to return something. She always does.  Sure enough, she has the boots.  Presumably in the same bag as last time.  I’m kind of busy at the moment (on the phone, I think), so she sets them on the counter and begins searching the clearance racks. 

I open the bag, and there’s a receipt for a completely different store. Not even a similar store.  I don’t know if she thought she was going to fool me, or what. I again tell her I can only give her what they scan for.  She spends the $32.99 on other clearance items, uses a coupon (because she wouldn’t be caught dead paying full price for anything), winds up owing like $5 or whatever.  Makes several bitchy comments such as, “I don’t know why you can’t just look it up in your system! You have all of my information in their anyways!”

After she left, I was so salty about the entire situation, I spent the time under her name in the system going through every single transaction until I found the one with the boots.  She had paid $17.49!!!!!!!!  I was infuriated!  They had probably been on clearance for the $32.99, then we had a 50% off on all clearance sale, or something similar.  And she was pissed at me that she couldn’t get the entire $110!!!!!

It’s people like her, abusing the system like that, that are causing retailers to fail!

I told my manager, and we figured out a way to remove her from the coupon mailing list. Finally.  I’m sure in a month or two she will realize something is up and either complain to us, or call our home office and complain about us, but we will cross that bridge when we get to it.

APigthatflys,"Kid smudges his ID photo, dad loses it at me","This happened a while ago but I just found this sub and it fits perfectly. Part of my job is to take Passport and other government ID photos for people. Of course the requirements for them are very strict and we have to let the customer know what not to do once they get their photos, including keeping them face-to-face since we stamp the backs with date and photo location, and if the stamp touches the face of the other photo it will smudge off. We also let them know that we don't do free-retakes for that since it's on the customer to make sure that doesn't happen, although we retake most other rejected pictures free of charge.

I have a mom and her kid (around 15/16) come in to retake their passport photo since one face had been smudged by the other stamp. I take them out of the envelope and the one stamp is against the other face (ofc). I let her know that I can retake it but that she'll have to pay again since we don't cover smudging like that. She was confused and pointed to our free re-takes sign, and I had to point out the ""restrictions apply"" portion of the notice. She asks for a manager to be called over so I do, and he just says to do it for free, but lets her know that we wont cover it again. So I take the photo, print, cut, and stamp them, and say the same thing I do everytime: ""Make sure to keep them face to face in here, that way the faces don't get smudged again."" She said ok and seemed content and left.

This is when it gets interesting. A few minutes pass and we get really busy. She comes back in with her kid and another man (her husband) who had to be at least 6'10"" but only weighed probably 150lbs; all height. He cuts the line and cuts me off with my customer, and just starts yelling at me about how I was ""blaming his wife for ruining their photos,"" and ""aggressively telling them to not fuck it up again."" I try to explain that's not what happened but he wouldn't let me talk, continuing to yell at me and demanding a refund and gift card. Gladly my manager saw the whole thing and came right over and pulled him away and talked to him. Within a minute he had stormed out, wife and kid walking slowly behind.

I found out later that this guy does this VERY often with every part of our store (and other stores). He'll send his wife in to get something, and then run back in fuming about something that happened within the store, demanding a refund and gift card. Haven't seen him in a long time so hopefully he never comes back.",TalesFromRetail,941,1535318707

I was on tills when this woman came up with this item from the reduced sale. We had recently started a sale where most of the stuff was 50% off so we also had a lot of people asking very annoying questions. This particular woman came up to me when I was on tills and made such a scene. She came up with this jacket that had been, let's say 40euro down to 20euro, and she was going on about how nice it was and such.

""So, if I want to return this, will I get the full price back?""

I was a bit puzzled by her wording but presumed I'd heard her wrong, ""If you  return it with your receipt and the tag on you get a refund of the paid price."" She then stares at me like I'm an idiot.

""That's not what I asked. If I buy this now, and return it, will I get the 40 euro back?""

""...This item is reduced. You're paying 20 euro for it, so you'd get your 20 euro back.""

""But it cost 40 euro!""

""Yes, and if somebody had bought it at 40 euro they'd get a refund of 40 euro. If you buy it for 20 euro you get a refund of 20 euro.""

She was fuming and asked to see the manager. The girl beside me on the tills, who was there a lot longer than me, repeated what I said. She went off in a huff and didn't want her reduced coat. Some people just keep surprising me.

bobbabouie91,Army officer believes his basic understanding of how a retail business operates will get him a discount,"So I’m one of the managers at a retail auto parts store. Our store is located near a military base so we’re no strangers to giving out 10% courtesy discounts to military members. But a few weeks ago I had a rather pompous Army officer who was new to the area that decided he was gonna come shopping for some parts. 

    After looking up the part he was looking for he was upset and informed me that he could get the same part online for 1/5th of the price and suggested we lower the price to match the part he’d found. I very politely informed him that we can’t price match online retailers for a number of reasons and assured him that the part we would be selling him may be more expensive, but he would know exactly what he’s getting and it would be backed by a lifetime warranty that the online part likely didn’t have. He then assured me that we were just grossly overpricing the part because the one he’d found on eBay was a direct OEM replacement, after all it had Ford stamped right on the product! I told him it’s very possible that he did find a really good deal, but that many such parts often come from Chinese retailers where copyright laws are basically nonexistent and they’ll stamp whatever brand name they want to on crap products and sell them with impunity. He conceded for a moment and I thought I’d finally convinced him that the price was justified, but then he hit me with a new move I’d never seen before.
 
  After realizing his plan to drop the price using sketchy eBay parts wouldn’t work, he resorted to using his masterful understanding of retail to lower our price. He informed me that he knows we charge more for parts then we pay for them, and that we should offer him a better price due to that fact. I told him that I’m only authorized to change prices if it’s to price match a comparable part from another parts retailer or under special circumstances to compensate customers for issues receiving or using a part, but that id be more than happy to give him a 10% discount for his military service. His attempt was something along the lines of. “I mean even if you guys only sell it to me $1 above cost then you’re making a profit on the part. So my question is what is the cost on that part to you guys and how close to that can we get.”

     I was honestly a little baffled for a moment that he’d even thought that this move would work, so I struggled as best as I could to remain professional and not sound condescending when I explained the next part to him. With such a profound knowledge of how business operates I would’ve figured he would understand logistics, but I proceeded to explain to him that the markup on a part is not straight profit and that it must take into account the transportation of the part to the store, the wages of the employees to sell the part, the electricity to run the store, etc etc. And that we would be losing money on the part to sell it to him at cost, and that I have no way of even looking up what it is we pay the manufacturer for the part. He of course got even more agitated that this plan wasn’t going so well either and he asked me one last time if there was anything I could do for him on the price. I told him that I would be more than happy to give him a 10% military discount, and he promptly stormed out of the store mumbling something about going to one of our competitors.

that_eventuality,"You have to close for a family emergency? Meh, probably nothing.","Please forgive any formatting errors. I don’t post much and am on mobile. This is a story from my time in retail that really upset me. Out of all the crappy encounters I had with customers, for some reason this is the only one that ever really got to me. 

Last year, I was working in a small resale shop where I worked alone. My grandma had been battling cancer for a very long time and she had very little time left. Unfortunately, due to anyone who could cover me being unavailable, I still had to go into the store the day she got really bad and went to the hospital. I told my boss what was going on and she said if I got a call to get there, to just close the store and go.

That call came. I had a few customers in the store...an older couple and a young family. I took the call in the back and came out and announced that I had a family emergency and would need everyone to make their purchases because I needed to leave. 

Everyone kinda nodded and just messed around. I was more anxious than angry at the time, worried about getting to the hospital - which was about 45 minutes from me - in time. Finally, very clearly fighting tears, I say once again that I’m sorry for the inconvenience but I need everyone to please bring purchases to the counter. Finally the older couple nonchalantly wanders up. 

After ringing them up, I again apologize. And they laugh and say, “oh it’s no trouble, we get it. We’ve had sick kids too!” And walk out the door. 

I was dumbfounded and hurt. I never said anything about a sick kid. I don’t even have children. 

The family took even longer, and when I finally rang them up, I apologized for having to ask them to leave and they said the same thing about “oh we get it we’ve had sick kids.” And I was so done at this point I just plainly said, “I don’t have children. My grandmother is dying.” 

I still don’t know why this made me so angry, but to this day it still does. Maybe a sick kid is what ‘family emergency’ is generally code for, but again I have no children, so I don’t know. I understand that it sucks to be kicked out of a place while you’re in the middle of shopping, but to take your sweet time because you decided all on your own it was for some minor issue enraged and hurt me. 

My grandmother was not aware when I got there. I don’t know if she had been before or not. Either way, it was the last time I saw her alive. ",TalesFromRetail,1912,1534826511

wohlsa,1.99 vs 199,"This is from several years ago, but still my favorite story from my time as a cashier. I worked at a home furnishing store, and this store also happened to sell rugs, and I mean EXPENSIVE rugs (animal hides and the like, would regularly run $200+).

One night at closing time I have a customer come up to my lane with a bunch of stuff. I ring her up and her total comes to multiple hundreds of dollars. She freaks a bit and asks to see the prices for her stuff, so I swivel my screen around and go through the list with her. We get to a rug (which rang up at $199, it was an animal hide rug) and she says ""wait, an employee told me that rug was one ninety-nine"". I forget how long it took me to put two and two together, but I eventually realized ""holy crap this woman thinks this huge animal hide rug is 2 dollars"" (aka, the other type of one ninety-nine: $1.99). 

By now the store has long been closed and the aisles have been cleared, but she demands to get someone from the department to check this discrepancy (of 198 dollars....) all rug salesmen had clocked out for the night so I had to call the person in charge of sales duty, which sucked because they have a ton of stuff to do to officially close the store, the last thing they need is to deal with a price dispute. Sales duty comes down and talks to the customer (pro ed the rug is actually $200) and eventually she decides she doesnt want it (shocker). All in all no one got snippy or rude, but that remains to this day my most baffling customer interaction. ",TalesFromRetail,866,1534645578
Soft-requiem,That's Not Our Sticker... That's Not Our Coupon,"This happened a few days ago. I just came into work, not even ten minutes when the cashier tells me over the radio that she needs me. I go over there and there's this young lady smiling at me. I'm already feeling the urge to roll my eyes.

I ask whats wrong.

Customer: ""The price for the shirt doesn't match the sticker. I'd like you to honor the sticker price.""

I look at the price tag of the shirt in question. No sticker. No marker. It's then that my cashier hands me the censor, there's a pink sticker on it that reads $4.99 and the shirt is $20 (If I remember correctly). Immediately, I know whats wrong. This isn't our sticker, the sticker we use for my store are red, and have even numbers so nothing in our store ends in .99.

Me: ""I'm sorry miss but this isn't our sticker. Ours are bright red and nothing in our store ends in .99 cents. I can't honor what isn't ours.""

Customer: ""You can't honor whats on the sticker?""

Me: ""I can't honor what isn't our price markers.""

Customer: ""Well, I'm a customer. Where does your policy say so?""

I get one of these customers at least once a week. they bring in stickers from where ever they get them from, slap them on a price tag and try to get a discount. I already have the policy printed out to be ready for them. It clearly states we cannot honor something that doesn't come from our company, legalities, all that jazz. I hand it out, and it's already highlighted for customers to read. Yeah. We're *that* ready.

Customer reads it over and over again like the ink was magically going to change.

Customer: ""Alright, I understand. Then can I use this coupon?""

She has it on her phone. I already know there aren't any coupons out right now. I look at it. It's for a different company.

I inform her that this isn't a coupon we can use because it's for a different company. Again, she's upset and wants to see the policy. I already have it printed. Hand it over. She pays for her stuff and leaves.",TalesFromRetail,705,1534632877
polelifeandpussy,But that’s a picture of your credit card...,"So I work at a supplement store. A woman comes I. 10 mins before close to make a return from an online purchase. She says she ordered these supplements for a trip but they arrived late so now wants to return them. Ok no problem.

First it’s starts to take a while because for some reason this purchase won’t appear on my computer like it’s supposed to. But it’s fine I get the ok from my manager to override and do this manually. 

So I get to the end and ask her to produce the card she had made the purchase with. Our policy is very clear that money must be put back in the exact card to prevent frauds. But this lady has not brought the card. She brought a photo of her card, and only of the front so not even the security code on the back.  I politely inform her that we actually need the physical card, but she tells me it broke.  

So now there’s several things that don’t make sense to me. Our shipping only takes 2 days so how did these arrive to late for her trip, and why would she not just want to keep them for use later? Why did she take a photo of her card before it broke? Did she know it was going to break? 

Well I inform the lady that we can’t finish the return with just a picture of the card, and as is written in our policy, we can’t give cash back for a card purchase. She starts yelling at me telling me heb let’s her and every other store let’s her. So I calmly tell her that I will call the manager. I already knew he would confirm the we need the card line but hey maybe this will calm her. He of course says no I politely inform her and she begins yelling at me again. 

Now it’s officially the time I have to close the store and I still have two customers behind her and I’ve spent over ten minutes trying to do this for her. 

It felt very satisfying to smile and wish her a good day as she finally picked her box back up and walked it ranting and yelling at me the whole time.

Adhara27,My favorite customer ever.,"This story happened back in '14. I was the bakery clerk at a chain grocery store. This store, in particular, was located near an extremely affluent (i'm talking multi-millionaires, celebrities) part of town. In fact, we were on the only road that led to a gated community just two miles away. Therefore, the vast majority of our clientele were either butlers or elderly retirees.

One known customer was known to the staff as Ms.Lemonface. She was a rude, bitter, demanding older woman that no one liked dealing with.

I, however, though I could break through her shell. Once a week, Ms.Lemonface would come into the store, demand I bake her a fresh loaf of a bread, and expect it to be waiting when she got done making her rounds of the store.

When I learned to predict she'd be there, I would bake the bread in advance and give it to her. This didn't make her happy. She said the bread would be cold by the time she got home. So I baked it normally and took it to her wherever she was in the store.

Then, I tried to enact conversations. At first, she dismissed me. Then, she responded with brief answers. Eventually, we got to a point where we would actually chat. It was light conversation, but it was better than stink-eyes.

After five months or so, we're on great terms. And then, one day, she begins crying. She spoke of how her husband had died some years ago, her kids were off spending their money in foreign countries, and she was all alone. She thanked me for my time and conversations, which had become the highlight of her weekly visits.

At this point I confessed to her that I would soon be moving. She promptly asked when. Not just the day. The time I would be clocking out for the last time. I let her know, and on my last day, as I went to the timeclock, there she was. She was waiting with a cake and an envelope.

She thanked me again for my conversation, hugged me, and told me goodbye for the last time.

When I got home, I cut myself a slice of cake and sat down to read the letter. In the envelope was a beautiful, heartfelt letter, (I admit that I cried about ten times reading it), and $5000 in cash. I was shocked. I know for her it may not have been much, but to a struggling student like me, it was a ton. It pretty much paid for rent and food for almost a year.

In retrospect, the fondest memory is still our last goodbye. Retail is rough more often than not. And sometimes, I want to tear my hear out. But some people make it all worthwhile.",TalesFromRetail,1273,1534453829
FozzyOfH2,The curious riddle of the buy one get one half price offer,"Last year I got a job in a book/stationary shop in the UK, my first retail job. I'd heard stories of bad customers before and always thought if I had to deal with someone like that I'd be able to laugh about it and deal with it no problem. I underestimated how dumb people can really be.  
I serve a lot of older customers in my shop, and a few of them do misread offers and promotions but it's always a minor issue. It was a major issue for this one guy though, who I will call CM (Confused Man). Our books in the book chart were on a buy one get one half price offer at the time. He brought a single book from the chart to the till.  

Me: ""Okay just the one book that's £7.99 please.""  

CM: ""...£7.99 is half price?""  

Me: ""That's full price, however if you buy another book off the chart one of them will be half price.""  

CM: ""But the sticker says buy one get one half price.""  

Me: ""Yes, if you get two books, you get one of them half price.""  

CM: ""No. No it says buy one get one half price. I am buying ONE, I get this ONE half price.""  

Me: ""...Uh, no see if you purchase two books, the offer makes it so you're buying one book and getting the other half price. Buy one, get one half price.""  

CM: ""That doesn't make any sense. I am BUYING ONE. I get this one HALF. PRICE. This is the one I am buying this is the one I get half price.""  

Me: ""Okay let me put it this way, if the sticker said buy one get one free, you wouldn't get this one book for free right? You'd have to have two, buying one to get the other free. It's the same thing here but half price instead of free.""  

CM: ""If it was buy one get one free this one would be free...""  

Me: ""...""  

CM: ""...""  

Me: ""It's £7.99 for the book.""  

CM: ""Well I don't have that much money on me I only have enough for a half price book.""  

At that point he walked away from the till and out the door muttering something about ""pathetic unhelpful staff"". To this day I still wonder if that was the first time he'd ever encountered a BOGOHP offer before.",TalesFromRetail,1986,1534416027
aTinyFly,"When the gates are down, don't crawl under them","We have these electric gates which uses a mechanism to pull them down, you operate it with your key. The mechanism itself is on the outside of the shop, meaning you have to leave the gates a bit open while you're closing up. I am very short, around 160 cm, so I can pull them down fairly far and easily crouch my way in without problem.   
The store is also extremely small, so I can hear more or less everything from the backroom. 

So,  I had closed up shop, counted the register and celaned up, it's 20 minutes after close. All I had to do was to go into the backroom and change so I could go home. While I was standing there minding my own business, in the middle of changing my tank top I hear a very distinct ""Excuse me? Excuse me!"". I was shocked- it sounded like it came from within the store! But it couldn't be, the gates were pulled down. I just stood there for a moment processing, then I heard it again. I threw on my other tank top and my jacket and slowly made my way to the door.  Right there, in the middle of his tiny freaking shop stood a TALL A\*\* MAN, at *least* 180 cm. I just stared at him in shock and disbelief. Remember, I am 160 and I crouch my way in, this man must have more or less crawled his way in!

Tall man:  ""Oh hey! Have you closed the register or can I buy somehing?"". I mean what? 

Me: ""Uuuh.. Uh no, it's closed, it's been closed for the past 20 minutes..."" 

Tall man: ""I see. Well, I see what I want on the shelf right there...""

He then points to it and there's a brief pause, I guess my stare got a bit on the pissed side because he suddenly said ""but I'll come back"" and then, as fast as he had appeared, he scurried to leave. It was not gracious at all, let me tell ya.   


I just don't understand the thought-process he had. The gate was down, he was struggling to even leave under it so why he thought it was a good idea to enter when the gate so far down is beyond me. In hindsight I wish I had just told him something like ""Dude, you need to leave now, why did you think this was gonna work for you?"", but I would never have believed someone would actually do this in a store that's obviously closed.

micksack,Customers lack of patience when calling,"So a couple of short tales about people and how impatient when it cones to phone calls and answering their calls. 

Just had a lad trying to arrange collection of his product, they wanted me to meet them not at my shop but someplace central to both of us. So I told him make sure and ring me at 530 to remind me that I have to meet you, as it's not a normal thing I do and I felt I might forget it. So 530 arrives and I'm dealing with a customer on the floor as I don't answer my phone as that would be rude to the customer in front of me. So about five later I'm finished with customer In shop and they call again we arrange our meeting and all good. 

Only then do I see the message from him. 

U not answer fone  is what he sent, so he called sent a message giving out i didnt answer and then called again all in the space of 3 minutes. 


I had another teenager call one day looking for a price on a product I didn't know off hand so I said I'll call you back in a minutes. Got a little distracted as you do sometimes on the floor and a call came through and I answered it and the same kid says to me "" you said you'd ring back in a minute"" luckily on my phone it displays your interactions with a number and I could see that I had hung up on him 48 secs earlier. Told him it was only 48secs and that id  call him back once I had a price. Had to explain it was a figure of speech and I didn't mean actually one minute. ",TalesFromRetail,691,1534265835
obsidiantron,“Well what are you going to do about it?!”,"So I just started working at a large grocery store, it’s my first job and I’ve only been there for about a month so I’m still new to everything.

A woman (around 45yo) comes through my till today with about a weeks worth of shopping. I put it all through, help her with her bags and ask if she has a store card (the ones to collect points for store coupons), she says no. Okay cool. I give her the total, she hands me the money and I put it away, close the cash drawer and hand her the change.

Suddenly she pulls out her colleague card (like a store card but you get a discount instead of points if you work in the company) and says “oh actually I do have my card!”. I say “oh great! Unfortunately the payments already gone through but I’m sure if you take it to customer service they can reimburse you.”

I wait, expecting her to leave and go to CS like I suggested, as she stares me down for a minute. She finally spits“well what are you going to do about it? I get money off”. After I calmly tell her again why I can’t do anything and that customer service would be able to help her, she snatched the receipt from my hand (actually catching the skin on one of my fingers fairly badly) and stalked off.

I’m sure I’ll experience worse the longer I work but I’m still trying to learn to not take this stuff personally, writing it out here so I can stop thinking about it and get some sleep.

HunterPunter560,"""Your pumps are FULL OF BEES!""","Just discovered this subreddit, and figured I could share my own experience. 
I work at a gas station in a small town-ish suburban area, not too far from the Steel City.  A recent high school grad, I'm young and full of life and interesting experiences...or so I thought.
Now there's many types of strange people that come through my store, including a Conspiracy Nut, an older gentleman who always complains to me specifically about the gas prices, (despite me being a lowly cashier), the woman who probably has a scratch off addiction, and the GreyWolf breeder.  But none of those colorful characters match up to the time I was terror attacked by bees.
It started off like a normal day of work, my first real job. I got checked in, switched shifts with my manager and got all the things set up for my shift. (Alot of boring details, not including them.) When I get back to the register after checking the pumps for skimmers, I look up and see a man, big smile.on his face, in a big Beekeeper outfit.  ""Good morning!"" He exclaims with glee as he swings our doors open. Unprofessionally, my curiousity got the better of me. ""Morning, whats with the suit?"" 
It was a boring, slow day so I was down to polite chat with a customer who wasn't a total jerk.  He told me how he was a beekeeper and that he sold honey and chapstick from materials he harvests from his own apiary. He goes on to tell me that he's transporting some to his house, and if they got loose.. ""Better hope you aint allergic!"" After paying for his gas the man leaves, and before getting into his carI witness him messing with a strange white box in his truck.  Five minutes later, after totally forgetting about the whole ordeal, a terrified customer bursts through the door, horified. ""Your pumpd ate full OF bees!"" He shouted, with a voice full of terror I shall never forget. ""...what?"" I come outside with trusty broom in hand, and sure enough, bees had surrounded and conquered the little pump island.  The terrified customer had already taken off.  My thoughts went to the beekeeper.. did the man deliberately open a honeycomb or whatever and unleash a flying horde of the bees? What ever it was, they soon flew off in search of you know, actual flowers.  My first real post like this, but I figured I had to tell the world about the day I faced a terror attack, but not from explosives or gunshots...literally bees.",TalesFromRetail,746,1534100309

He slowly walked in front of us to make sure that we noticed that he had came in with the product and then proceeded to rush towards the back of the store.  We thought it was suspicious and continued to watch him through the security mirrors and saw him look left and right down the aisles and quickly switched the box that he brought in with a different box on the shelf and slowly wandered around the store.

BaldBeeredandBeardly,That one time we stopped a crime ring,"A few years ago I was working at a videogame store. We learned to recognize customers who would consistently come in with mint condition new release games and insist on trading them in for cash, despite the fact that we paid pennies on the dollar. We strongly suspected they were stealing from somewhere, but due to a lack of tangible evidence and corporate policy on the matter there wasn't much we could do about it. We started keeping a handwritten binder with details in case anyone ever asked.  


One day a uniformed police officer walked into the store and straight to the cash wrap. He handed me a photo of a woman from a security camera.   


**O**fficer: ""Do you recognize this woman?""  
**M**e: ""Yes, sir. She comes in here all the time and trades in new-looking games for cash.""

M: ""Well, \[x\] is the woman in the picture. I also recognize this name, that name, and these 2 names here. I've never seen any of them come in together, though.""  
O: ""They have been operating a crime ring where they steal from retail stores, exchange the merchandise with each other, then a different person pawns it for cash somewhere else. Do you have any information on them?""  
M: ""Actually, we have this binder...""

She then turns around and proceeds to wipe a whole shelf of cold medicine into the other, then beelined it directly to the front of the store and tried to leave through the front door.

Clever_BigMack,Why can’t you look up my account!,"This happened a few days ago. I work at a cell phone retailer that has several ways you can pay a bill in store. We have systems where we can look up your account on a tablet to see a more detailed bill breakdown or a bill pay system where we just type in your number and it shows how much you owe.

Customer (40 year old man) walks in while we have a small line and sits down to wait. 5 minutes go by and he starts to get pretty agitated. 10 minutes go by and I finish up with my last customer and approach him as he is almost visibly angry.

TheFascination,Get me a fresh one!,"I work in electronics. Older people can understandably be confused by technology, so I normally go out of my way to be accommodating to the elderly, but this lady was something else.

&gt;Old Lady: I’d like to buy these wireless security cameras. My friend got them for $100 off last week, so I want it for the same price.

&gt;Me: The sale is over, so unfortunately we can’t give you that price. All I can offer you is a price match if a competitor has a better price.

&gt;OL: You’re the only store that sells these! [Not true, but why argue?] I’m old and people get robbed in my neighborhood! You need to be nicer to old people like me. I don’t have this kind of money!

Predictably, she asks to speak to my manager, who tells her exactly what I said. She concedes grumpily.

&gt;OL: I don’t want the ones that were sitting on the shelf. Go get me a fresh box from the back.

&gt;Me: But they’re the same thing....

&gt;OL: Please, just to make me happy!

I go to get another box.

&gt;OL: [snatching the new box] How long has this been sitting back there? Where’s the expiration date?

At this point I realize she thinks electronics are like perishable food and will go bad on the shelf. I crank up my salesperson persuasiveness to Full Throttle and, after a long conversation, manage to get her to the register to check out. (She makes me push her cart of course.) I’m about to wish her a good day and escape when suddenly...

&gt;OL: How do I power these cameras?

&gt;Me: The batteries are rechargeable, and they last several months on a charge.

&gt;OL; Wait, you mean I have to recharge them? I’m 82 years old, I can’t get on a ladder to take them down!

&gt;Me: Well we have cameras that can be plugged in instead.

&gt;OL: So then the burglars will just unplug them, and then what good will they be? That’s why I want wireless!

&gt;Me: How would you prefer them to be powered?

&gt;OL: I don’t know!

So not only does she think her cameras will rot on the shelf like last month’s mangoes, she also would like them to draw power directly from the cosmos.

She bought them anyway.",TalesFromRetail,1365,1533802428
god_damn_bitch,"""An asthma attack is a personal attack on the customer""","So this happened a few years back when I was working at your favorite, now defunct toy store. 

For some background, the store I worked in was very old, no air conditioning and the air flow was terrible. This specific day was a very humid and hot day (New England summers are HUMID)and I had been having issues with my asthma on and off. 

I had been working at the electronics desk, grabbing video games and just working as a general checkout. I grabbed some games from the lockup for a customer and headed back to my checkout desk. Two people were already waiting in line. I did my usual spiel. apologizing for the wait etc. Customer is visibly agitated already so I can tell this will be fun. She's pulling a bunch of stuff out of her cart, saying she no longer wants it. That's cool, at least she didn't shove it on a shelf somewhere. As I'm turning around to place her item she doesn't want on the counter, I can feel an asthma attack coming. I do that thing when you feel like you can't breathe so you try to inhale really hard. She assumed I was sighing at her for not wanting her items (for real, don't care, I'm not closing, not my problem).

This began the biggest freak out of the day. This woman starts yelling at me for being rude, saying it's my job to take her things she doesn't want and to be polite. As she's yelling I'm now start to stress out, making my asthma worse. As she's still yelling at me, I sit down. That was apparently the wrong move. She decides that it's the final straw and saying ""I'm not buying any of this, you need to learn how to treat customers!"".

She did call corporate, I was talked to by my manager about it and explained the whole thing (she knew about my asthma), which was on video. My manager actually apologized for the customer saying ""I never knew an asthma attack is a personal attack on a customer."" I will never forget that line or that manager. She was amazing.

zarinvienne,“But you don’t even know me.”,"Ftp, ltl, etc, etc. 

So for a little background I work at a tool store that’s best known for their prices and coupons and today was just another Sunday. 

A lady comes up and I get her phone number and proceed with the transaction like normal. We make small talk and she’s just a nice customer, which is rare on Sundays. 

She puts her card into the chip reader and then checks her phone. 
Our machines time out after so long so I had said: 

Me: “I’m not trying to rush you but I just wanted to let you know that the pin pad is asking you a question. It times out after so long.”

Customer: “No, it’s fine.” And from here her sentence gets a little incoherent and all I hear is “my dad....must be calling the family.”
She then begins tearing up while she finishes up on the pin pad. 

I then ask her if she wants a hug and she didn’t say anything, she just kind of starts crying more. 
I’m a huge sympathy crier, so as soon as she started tearing up, I’m tearing up. 
So I walked around the counter and held my arms out in case she decided to take me up in my hug. 

She did and I just held her and rubbed her back for a good 30 seconds while she cried on me. 
In the midst of her hug, I heard her mumble, “but you don’t even know me.”

She then asked me my name and I couldn’t answer since I was crying with this lady I just met and I just pointed to my name tag. 

She said “thank you” and I handed her the receipt and she went about her day. 


I’m not sure what type of people she’s been dealing with her life, but it just bothered me that she was so surprised at someone showing her some sympathy while she’s going through a hard time. ",TalesFromRetail,1318,1533511083

wow_plants,Angry Velociraptor Tries to Offer Bank Statement as a Receipt,"To add a bit of backstory: I'm sixteen. I've had my job in a $2 shop for just over nine months and I do really enjoy it. I get along well with my coworkers, my manager is an absolute sweetheart, and since we typically attract an older clientele, most customers are extremely polite. That's surprising, considering in New Zealand we have a culture around being asshats to retail workers.

There have been only three problem customers I can recall in my time at the shop. One was a guy who had a hissy fit on my second day because an ankle brace he bought was the WRONG COLOUR (he then came back with another one from a different shop, as though I either cared or could do anything about it). The second was a man who swore at me because he didn't bring his wallet into the shop and had to run out to his car for money because the computer made a mistake with rounding up the cash he needed for his purchase.

The third was today. A man came in with two items he'd purchased almost two weeks ago. Our refund policy says we cannot offer refunds on items that have been bought more than seven days beforehand.

I was busy serving another customer, but I tried to move through their purchase as quickly as possible so I could serve this man (who we'll call ""C""). He looked pretty impatient, and I was looking forward to finally dealing with a grumpy customer. The day was quiet and I have issues.

My coworker (""H"") ended up dealing with this guy.

C pulled out a bunch of pieces for a milk frother and a lamp, and slammed them down on the counter. ""I bought these items and I can't put them together. They're broken. I want a refund."" He then proceeded to take out two receipts, one from his bank (like that would be of any use) and one from a completely different purchase.

""I'm sorry sir, these aren't the right receipts.""

""Well I want a refund.""

I was standing at the next counter, using every ounce of willpower to not laugh. I didn't mean to, I'm awkward and I get flustered easily.

""We can't do anything with these, sir,"" sighed H.

""I WANT A REFUND. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!"" snapped C. He then decided to guilt us with something about how the other shops in the mall could look old purchases up in their system.

""Sir, I'm sorry,"" I said. ""Our system isn't that advanced.""

This guy was getting really angry, literally shouting at us, and didn't seem to understand why he would need to hang on to a receipt for ""a piece of crap that cost ten dollars!""

I realised he needed help with getting a modem cord, so in an attempt to deescalate the situation I took him down the electronics aisle while H tried putting together the milk frother and light. The first cord was the wrong plug. Okay, my bad. The second one I knew was the right cord, but I just wanted to check with the customer that it was the one he wanted.

He huffed like I'd asked him to hack off a limb. ""Ugh, I'll go and ask the man at the counter! I'm sure HE'LL know what I'm after!"" *AS IF HE HADN'T BEEN YELLING AT MY COWORKER JUST TWO MINUTES AGO.*

As he headed back up to the counter, H handed back the items and said, ""I don't know what I did, but the milk frother is fixed. And the battery in the light had gone flat. I've replaced it for you, so it's working again.""

And just like that, C was all cheerful like nothing had happened. He didn't apologise, of course, but paid for his items and left. The fecking prat left his card in the EFTPOS machine.

He sat in his car for the next fifteen minutes while we made the scatching remarks you can't avoid after dealing with an idiot customer.

""Haha, I hope he gets home before he realises he's forgotten his card.""  
""I hope he thought he was an idiot when you fixed that damn milk frother.""  
""We couldn't have helped him anyway, the receipts were a week out of date.""  
""Why did he give me a *bank statement*?""

Fast forward another ten or so minutes. The guy came back in and asked if he'd left his card here. No problem. H handed the card back, expecting him to leave right away. Oh, *no*.

""Isn't your phone working? I've been calling for half an hour!""

No thank-you, not even a grateful smile.

""The phone's upstairs, only the manager uses it for contacting other branches, and she's not here today.""

The guy gave us this incredulous look, snapped, ""Oh, for *fuck's* sake! This is a *retail shop*, you know!"" and stomped out.

Nah, matey. We've only been working there for nine months. We had no idea it was a retail shop.",TalesFromRetail,1704,1533456345
SpicyHashbrowns,"Yes, the children's clothes have security tags too...","This lady rolled in just today. Started out with her trying a ridiculous amount of clothes on in the fitting room. She kept nothing. Halfway through she left the room unattended for nearly twenty minutes, so naturally I cleaned it out. She came back mad that I had put the clothes away on my fitting room rack. She grabbed some of the garments back and went back into the fitting room she was hogging.

I had to check her out, she had none of the clothes she took back from me. I'm sure she just stashed them elsewhere for me to find. All she had was children's clothing now. After I would scan something she would snatch it out of my hand and fold it. Most of the things she was grabbing had security sensors on them. All through this she's sighing heavily and is obviously impatient. I then told her I needed to remove the security tags from the clothes before I bag them.

""Why are there security tags on kids clothes?!"" She grunted.

""For security?"" I reply.

""Ridiculous.""

I removed them, she yanked the bag from me and left without so much as a thank you.",TalesFromRetail,2866,1533400818
himym101,Why don't customers listen? It's not like I take payments all day every day... like it's my job.,"So two pieces of backstory I think might be important to this story. Firstly, I work in a large retail store with a really disorganised area for customers to queue up. Best I can explain it, there are three points of contact that customers tend to wait and they don't ever pay attention to each other. Management has a renovation planned to make the whole thing much more streamlined but until then the best I can do it make a mental note of when people arrived and attempt to serve them in the correct order. 

Second, I live in Australia where the contactless type of payment is huge. Literally, 9 out of 10 card payments are a tap 'n' go, pay wave, paypass whatever you want to call it. However, a lot of the older generation distrust it and get extremely defensive when you even dane to suggest they use it. They will hand me their credit card and then get mad when I ask if they want to tap because that's the only reason they should be giving me the card. The EFTPOS machine is in front of them, not me. 

On to the rude customer today, hence forth known as ""not my mate"" (NMM). NMM had decided to wait in my least preferred approach when I had a line up of customers at another. This is right in my far peripheral and I can't see this spot without physically turning my head. I noted his position in line like always and kept serving people in the order they arrived. I could see that he was getting annoyed but instead of moving in the main line which he could clearly see, he decided to huff and puff just outside of my line of sight. 

I turned to him when it was his turn and said ""I can help you over here, mate,"" 

It's hardware. It's Australia. Everyone is called mate. He apparently doesn't like this. 

""I'm not your mate,"" he snaps at me before throwing the single item he had to purchase on the counter. I scan it, tell him the total and he throws his card onto the counter as well. I pick it up, motion to the eftpos machine and ask ""tap?"" 

""No"" he snatched his card from my hand and grabs the machine. He apparently doesn't trust that f**ing tap thing. He barely inserts the chip into the machine and it doesn't register. 

""You have to push it in a bit more,"" I helpfully explain but NMM tells me to stop talking. It's not like I serve over a thousand customers a day and have seen every error message ever to exist. 

He pulls it out and inserts again, doing the exact same thing. It doesn't register. So instead of listening to me, ""you don't know what you're talking about,"" NMM decides to swipe the card down the side. Which of course is too close to the contactless reader. He's just paid via the tap function without realising. I can hear the specific beep that says pay wave was used. 

""You've just used pay wave,"" I explain as the transaction goes through and he tries to continue choosing his account and entering the pin. The eftpos machine is making loud noises letting him know that his button pressing is doing nothing but he's not reading the screen.

""No, I've done that right, I swiped it,"" he replies happily, grabbing the receipt from my hand and leaving the store. 

I wonder if he'll even notice.",TalesFromRetail,1980,1533297247
jake2188,I spilled my gas I would like a refund please.,"Worked at a very busy gas station and my manager informs me there is a gas spill @ pump whatever. I goto the pump and meet the lady who begins to explain what happened. Thinking she was just being courtious making sure someone knew about a potential hazard I begin to explain its no big deal, it happens all the time, I'll clean it up right away, thanks for bringing it to my attention. She says no, the machine malfunctioned and she would like a refund for the gas that spilled. In all likelihood she probably tried to top off her tank and overruled, quite common. In a somewhat state of shock I step back and look at the very small gas spill and say ok, well the problem is I have no way of determining how much gas spilled, so how much were you looking to be refunded? Shes say at least like $5! I take a quick peek at the price ( about $2.50) and explain to her thats about 2 gallons and would be all over the place if that were the case.

MajorTomsHelmet,Dorothy Clicks Her Heels And Says GTFO (Again),"Several years ago I was working the closing shift at a clothing store. We were open until 9pm and I was in the process of closing the door at 9:05 when it was CAUGHT by three 60-something women that said

""We know what we are after.""

I foolishly believed them. They came in, filled their arms with clothes and went to the fitting rooms.

( For reference, I was wearing a black dress with red heels)

At 9:15, I went to the fitting rooms to ask them if they were ready to check out, as we had closed at 9 and they said they knew what they were after.

I was met with ""We will be done when we are done, don't worry!

Have you ever felt anger so hard that your scalp is tingling and your vision tunnels and everything goes black? YEAHHH....

Against everything I had been taught about customer service, it bubbled out of me before I could stop it...

"" Ladies, you have 10 minutes to decide what you need before the police department is called by ADT. When they respond, you will be charged a $1500 false alarm fee. It is our responsibility to see that we have set the alarm by 9:30, the silent alarm will trip and they will be here by 9:35. There is nothing I can do to stop this procedure.""

semmc720,Guy seems to think I’m purposely not selling him the cigarettes he wants.,"I just started working in an off licence/liquor store and last night’s shift was pretty dead, with me and one other guy on shift. My coworker was out back taking stock and I was on tills when this happened.

A youngish guy who wasn’t from my country asked for JPS King cigarettes while I was ringing up his other stuff, and since I’m not entirely familiar with different brands yet I accidentally gave him Superkings. He left and about five minutes later, a friend came in and asked to have them exchanged for Kings. No problem. Until I quickly discovered we were all out.

M for me, F for friend.

M: sorry, we’re out of Kings, are there any others he would like?

F: (seeming quite confused) yes, blue.

A little bewildered, I point to the JPS blue and he nods, pays the extra for them, and leaves.

Until around two minutes later, when the original guy comes back. G will be guy.

G: Excuse me, I asked for Sterling!

M: (in my head) You didn’t and I know you didn’t but okay...

Once again, I pointed to Sterling Green and he said yes, so I exchanged his cigarettes yet again.

And you guessed it, he came back a few minutes later.

G: These are MENTHOL!

Now, that was partly my bad since I am pretty unfamiliar with most cigarette types, but this guy had specifically said yes when I asked him were those the ones he wanted. So once again, I gritted my teeth, apologised, and asked my coworker to pick out non-menthol ones of the same brand.

That seemed to be the end of it, although at one point I came back from the bathroom to find my coworker explaining to the same guy that we didn’t have any of the cigarettes he had come in for in the first place.

Claxton916,*You* broke them!,"I work at a big box retail store that's pretty exclusively in the Midwest, specifically I'm in flooring/window treatments. Our store's policy on returns is that we accept everything unless it's like a bucket of mortar that you used half of. We are willing to take blinds back even if we cut them, we just defect them out immediately.

I'm pretty good at what I do, I rarely break blinds because I know how to handle them properly.

Today a lady came in with blinds that were already cut, but she told me she needed another half inch removed off it. She practically shoved the blinds into my arms and walked away.

As I opened the box I saw that the aluminum slats were bent in such a manner that A) They're unusable, at least in a good home. B) They won't fit into my trimmer.

I went to see if I had another blind to replace it, but there were none on the shelf and an out of stock tag was in place so I went to my computer to see if maybe I have some in order or if another store has them, but unfortunately no.

I went back to the aisle where I began to tell the lady that because her blinds were bent I couldn't cut them, I was about to tell her she could still return them for a full refund before she cut me off and in an exaggerated tone said ""you broke them, they weren't broken when I came here.""

I told her that I'm sure I didn't break them. 

""I spend THOUSANDS of dollars here. I'm going to talk to your manager about this, what's your name."" She bitched

""My name is u/Claxton916, unfortunately my manager is not in the department so you'll have to go to the front and talk to a GM there."" 

""I will""

So I went to the self checkouts after I finished my grocery shift to buy two things. As I started scanning, a women (standing to my right on an open self serve register) puts her basket on my bench and turns to me and says something along the lines of ""that was so rude"". I assumed she was joking about how it was rude that she put her basket on my bench (I thought maybe she didn't have enough space on her bench or whatever). 


Me: Oh no, it's not rude at all, it's totally fine.

C: No, it's not fine. It was really rude. 

Me: Um, no, it's not a problem, it's all good. It's fine, really.

C: No, you should know better, especially since you work here

It was at this point I realised she was calling *me* rude. Apparently she had already (silently) called dibs on that machine, even though she was already standing in front of an open machine and only put her basket down at the same time I started scanning. 


I started apologising and said I misunderstood her and obviously wouldn't have just taken over her machine if I saw she was using it and she looked at my name tag (which I forgot to take off after my shift ended (oops!)) and said she was going to report me.

lyanderthal,I also had a pet food explosion situation...,"I wrote this as a comment to the other story about customers and their pet food antics, but it was kind of long so I thought I'd post it on its own instead. 

At the store I worked at we had guns to scan the heavy stuff, and sense I am a 5 foot and 115 lb the last thing I want to do is lift anything over 30 lbs that's placed on a counter too high for me to use my legs. I made a point to tell people not to worry about their large/heavy items I can get it with my gun. 

However, this man wouldn't hear of it, he insists he place his big bag of dog food on the belt. He puts it up there and I scan it with my gun and say, ""ok, you can put it back in your cart now."" He's not happy. I explain I can't lift a big floppy bag of dog food thats half my size with arm muscles alone but he insists he won't put it in his cart until I move it to the bag carousel. We go back and forth a few times and then he throws the ""didn't they teach you the customers always right"" line at me. 

FINE! 

I slide the bag as close to the carousel as I can and then heave it over. It hits the carousel and the bag rips. A rain of dog food goes everywhere. 

My co-worker that saw everything comes up looks at me exasperated like I'm the dumbest person ever and says, ""what were you thinking! What kind of person thinks somebody your size should be lifting that? You should have let them leave it in the cart and scan it with your gun!""

Lady 1: We don't have IDs with us!

Me: Well, sorry, *you* said the alcohol is for you so I need to see *your* IDs.

Dude: But I'll be paying for it! I'm with them, I can buy it!

Me: No. That's not how this works. As soon as I can determine that alcohol will be going to underaged persons, I can refuse the sale. Which I'm doing rn. Feel free to buy something else, but no alcohol for you guys. The ladies don't have IDs with them, so I can't sell you that stuff.

Lady 1: Wtf? You can't do this!

Me: Oh, of course I can *takes the alcohol from the belt and puts it under the register, where a small cart for returns is* Can I help you with anything else?

Dude: You're ruining all the fun for tonight! Seriously, screw all of this *walks off in a huff*

Me: Sooo...nothing else I can help you with?

Lady 1: Fuck you!

Me: *smiles* Thanks, you too. Have a nice evening.


Some people really are frustrating when alcohol is involved. I won't break some laws just so you guys can ""have fun tonight"". Fuck such people.

clairewil,So used to customer ridiculousness that I didn’t realise someone was joking,"I work at a large fashion chain, and yesterday I had a customer approach my till with one of our bags, which usually means a return. No sweat, we have a generous return policy, and we would get roughly 20 returns a day. Funny guy will be FG and I will be Me.

FG: Hi, I’d like to return these pants.

Me: No worries, Sir. 

FG: Oh, the tag came off and my dog chewed them a bit, that’s okay right?

(He was joking, but I deal with so many cases like this that I just assumed he was serious)

Me: (Holding back a sigh) Oh... well, if you just show me your receipt I’ll see what I can do for you. 

FG: What’s a receipt?

I stared at him with gritted teeth for a long couple of moments before he pulled the untouched pants with tags attached and the receipt out of the bag. I finally cottoned on and started to laugh. I had to apologise to him and explain that I’d thought he was serious, because I literally had a lady try to return a top with cigarette burns last week and “my dog chewed it” isn’t really out of the ordinary for us. 

The dude was super nice and quite shocked that I hadn’t caught on that he was joking straight away. Got a bit of retail sympathy and then he went on his way. ",TalesFromRetail,3040,1532761631
Scar_of_Talon,No Jalapeno Bread for You,"This story takes place in the same grocery store as my last story.

At this store, the deli closes at 10 and we must leave by 11 (the store itself closes at midnight). This lady comes by at around 10:45 demanding that we tell her where the bakery people are. JL is for Jalapeno Lady, T is for my coworker.

JL: Where are all the bakery people!?

Me: I'm sorry ma'am but I believe they have left already

(Bakery leaves about an hour earlier than us)

JL: Well go check
 
I run over to the bakery section and look to see if anyone stayed late but they didn't.

Me: I'm sorry ma'am but they aren't here right now, they will be when we reopen at 6am.

JL: Just fill out my order for jalapeno bread!

Me: I'm sorry, we can't do that. We're deli.

My coworker overhears the conversation and won't take no for an answer. To try and just get her to leave my coworker agrees to fill out the order (he used to work bakery).

T: When would you like to pick it up?

JL: Tomorrow

T: I'm sorry ma'am but our orders have to have at least 24 hours notice.

JL: I don't care, just write it down and give it to them.

My coworker keeps on trying to tell her that he can't do the order due to short notice but she pretends not to hear him and walks away.

She didn't even get her bread because she never gave us her name, what time she was going to pick it up, a phone number, or anything. Apparently bakery was really frustrated about the situation (my coworker gave them the semi filled out order form anyways) and decided to not make the order.

Oshbac,Secret Sales,"Normal Thursday running the frontend of my local major grocer. Suddenly a blinking light in the express lane. I approach the register and see 15 packages of double stuff Oreos. My associate tells me that the customer thinks they are ringing up the wrong price. We are currently running a special on Nabisco products where if you buy 3 you get them for $1.99 each.  I look at the total and do basic math in my head and can tell instantly they are the right price. Customer proceeds to show a receipt  from earlier where she got an extra $3 off Belvita. The coupon code was just for Belvita if it was for all Nabisco products then it would say ""Nabisco"" in the coupon code. She then tells me that the tag said it so I proceed to the aisle and grab a tag to show her that she's not reading it right. The tag only references $1.99 when you buy 3. I check the ad and she immediately laughs and says its not in the ad. I tell her then there's nothing I can do for her and explain to her that because there is no signage with the sale on it. 

She then says ""Ah these stupid secret sales, your computer system must be messed up."" 

I respond ""Ma'am, we don't have secret sales....""

Her response ""I'm an extreme couponer, I know these things.""

PS: I have a burning hatred for extreme couponers. They have such an obnoxious elitist attitude about it and when one coupon gets refused they bitch and moan up our chain of command till they get their way.",TalesFromRetail,1284,1532670927
MrCsumm,Don't Speak unless I authorize it,"Just discovered this sub not too long ago. I binged for 3 hours the first night. I've been working sales jobs for awhile now. This story is from a couple of years ago when I worked at a large car dealership. The way our business worked is all of our inventory is online and customers can call into the internet office and ask questions abs schedule appointments to come see the vehicles. Well I get a call from what I assume is a middle aged woman. I'll be me and the lady can be MW. 

Me: Hello thank you for calling (dealership) my name is MrCsumm. How can I help you today?

MW: Hello I was looking at a car you guys have. 

I figure out what car she is talking about and start to ask some discovery questions on why she is interested. We talk for a min or two. She seems OK to me. Not overly pleasant but not mean either. Then she says,

MW: Now I have a list of questions about the vehicle. 

Me: OK certainly I'll do my best to answer them. 

MW: Does this vehicle have ABS system on it?
[Pause]

Me: OH yes almost all newer vehicles will have...

MW: NOW SHUT UP AND LET ME GET OUT WHAT I NEED TO GET OUT WITHOUT INTERRUPTING ME! 

Now normally I can keep my cool with customers, even when they are being difficult. The outburst from her was just so unexpected. For some reason this made me snap and very calmly I replied, 

Me: Ma'am if you are going to speak to me like that then you are more than welcome to call in and have another salesperson assist you because I will not. 

MW: Maybe I will!

Me: OK, goodbye ""click"" I hung up on her 

Nobody ever got another call from her and my response definitely wasnt the right one either. But I tell you what; It felt damn good to respond that way. I told my manager about it later and she said I should have handled it differently but she didn't blame me.

Atheistlady,Woman wants frozen lasagna (at below zero ) cut in half with a saw or hot knife.,"I am doing something in the back and noticed a nice older lady come up. She begins speaking to one of the employees who doesn’t speak English fluently. I come up to intervene and she asks me to cut the frozen lasagna in half so she can cook half.i told her that is impossible as we freeze our lasagnas in a freezer that gets below 0 degrees. Another co-worker of mine steps in. Let’s call him Mr. Fantastic! Well he must have overheard and steps in. She asks us if we have a saw in the back. That surely can cut through the lasagna. Well no we do not have a saw in the back. Mr. Fantastic explains to this woman it’s too cold to cut through, multiple times. She asks again. Mr. Fantastic tells her No ma’am. She asked again about the saw. She then says we can heat up a knife and cut it. We tell her no we can’t  do that. She insisted that she’s done it at home so surely it can be done in our kitchen. Mr. fantastic has  to explain how it’s too frozen to possibly do this. He then just says the best thing ever. He says to this insistent woman that he doesn’t want to do it and he won’t. Perfect. The best part is she bought the lasagna anyway.

PertaVinGrahl,Everyone interrupts every private party.,"I am so surprised at how long it took me to finally stumble across this subreddit. I have been living for these stories and I have a few years worth of my own to add. 

I work in a popular franchise that lets you paint pottery and do a few other mediums as well. We also host those paint and drink parties. For all the years that I have been there, we only host adult private drinking parties AFTER HOURS.  I cannot stress that fact enough. Yet we always get calls from angry customers saying they couldn't pick their pottery pieces up the night before because we had a party and a sign saying they can't come in. Every time we tell them it was after hours, so even if a party hadn't been in the studio, they still could not have picked up their pieces. Anyway, the sign doesn't stop everyone. We have our hours posted on our door, and if there's a party, a sign next to it saying, ""Private party. Do not knock or disturb."" There has never been a single party where at least one customer doesn't bang on the door or force their way in.

On to my most recent incident of this. I was hosting a party with a rather miserable woman. She was upset that we would not close the studio two hours early to accommodate her party. She made it very clear that she would definitely not tip if outside people tried to come in while she was there with her group. Naturally, about an hour and 20 minutes into this party, I see the telltale sign of someone about to bust in. A pregnant woman and two kids are at the door. I see her reading the sign with our hours. I see her look at the sign saying ""Private Party."" I see her do a double take and then yank on the handle. I go flying over.  Me = me  Pregnant Lady = PL

Me: Excuse me ma'am, I can't let you in right now. There is a private party.

PL: I'm here to pick up my pieces.

Me: I'm sorry, you will have to come back tomorrow when we are open.

PL: You're open now. People are in there.

Me: Actually, we closed over an hour ago. There's a sign right here asking people to not disturb this private party.

PL: That's ridiculous. Let me in. I'm just picking something up. It will only take you a second. 

Me: I can't let you in. This is a private party. We are not allowed to serve customers when the studio is not open.

PL: This is insane! I drove forty minutes to get here to pick up these pieces. You have to let me in.

(Here is where I explain, probably for the 10,000th time in my job here to the 10.000th customer to have done this, that we are not open. Our hours are posted online, and she can check those for future reference. If a party was not currently in the studio and she still drove all the way out here without checking our hours, she would have walked up on a closed, dark store and still could not have gotten her pieces)

PL: This is an outrage. I will be calling tomorrow to speak to someone about what a terrible employee you are! After that, I'm going to call the better business bureau! 

(At this time, my party person is making it clear that I have spent too much time at the door and she needs attention. I can feel this tip slipping away and I can already tell this party will stay past their designated time and trash the place)

Me: I'm sorry ma'am, I have to go now.

PL (pulls on door as I am shutting it) No, you have to let me in! I drove forty minutes!

Me: Ma'am, I am the only person here and I am supposed to be helping this party. I need you to leave.

I finally shut and lock the door. I would have kept it locked, but people from the party kept stepping outside to smoke. Anyway, the two kids look a little down, but ultimately don't seem to care. PL, on the other hand, bangs on the door off and on for ten minutes. Finally, I look back up and she flips me off before walking back into the night.",TalesFromRetail,1767,1532461019

It’s not like they are sealed right, I’m thinking he did that and tried to get a discount on that 30 dollar item. I know this because earlier in the day, me and a coworker were over there looking for an item for webs and I saw it intact.

TheOnlySpach,The Peach Lady,"So, I work in produce at a large blue store.

Today I had a disaster of a customer.  I was straightening up my area when I see this lady.She was putting peaches in a bag, when the bottom broke.


Her:  ""Well these aren't very good bags, haha.""
Me:  ""It happens sometimes.  The bags are thin.""


I proceed to pick up the peaches and put them back in the bin that they were taken out of.
Her:  ""What are you doing?!""
Me:  ""Putting the peaches back.""
Her:  ""Not after they've rolled all over the floor!""
Me:  ""It's fine.  You are supposed to be washing your produce.""
Her:  ""Give me those!""
She snatches them from me.  I start walking away.

Her:  ""What's your name?!""
Me:  ""TheOnlySpach.""
Her:  ""I'm reporting you to a manager!  That's a health code violation!""
Me:  ""Alright.""

I was done for the day, so she watched me leave as I was heading to the back to swipe out.

It turns out she went up to the produce doors and demanded to see the manager.  Unfortunately, he wasn't in today.  So, she gives the peaches to one of my coworkers, and demands that they throw them out.  My coworkers were doing stuff, so the peaches were just set to the side.  She didn't like that.  


""Well aren't you going to throw them out?!""  
""They have to be weighed, and scanned before being thrown.""


She left in a huff about how the store was violating health code violations, and how she's going to call the health inspector.

Actual_trash,You need a switch to play switch games,"Just recently posted in this sub but I've remembered another good story. Happened with my colleague but I listened to the whole thing and it was incredible.

So we had this lady come into the video game store I work at saying she bought Mario kart 8 off our website and wanted to return it.

My colleague asks what wrong with it and she says;
""I don't have the console for it, I thought you put it into the TV"".

My colleague is clearly dumbfounded but she looks inside the cardboard packaging is was delivered in to check the game was there and everything was all good with it. 

Everything was not all good with it. The game was there but the case was ripped open in a way that suggested that this lady not only thought the game went into the TV but she also didn't know how to open a game case. The plastic was bent out of shape and the inlay was completely ripped.

(Colleague will be C, Switch lady will be SL) 

C: ""I'm sorry but you can't return this as it has been opened""

SL: ""but I had to open it, how would I know it was for the switch if I didn't open it?""

C: ""well it says Nintendo switch right there... ""

SL: ""but I had to open it to find out it didn't fit into the TV, please give me a refund.""

C: ""I can't the case is too damaged to give you a refund even if I wanted to, there's no way we can re-sell this. All you can do is trade It in for a fraction of price you bought it for or buy a switch for £280...""

After a bit of back and forth the lady walks away from the counter and me and my colleague ask each other what just happened. My colleague then goes into the back and sure enough switch lady walks back up to the counter and tries asking me to refund her.

doyouwantablow-job,"I'm not the store, you can't buy things I own.","This story happpened a few months ago (late May) and I work at a pretty popular garden center.

I don't really know why, but this garden center had a hell of a time trying to keep strawberry plants in stock. We would always sell out within 48 hours of any shipments. 

One day we got like 80 six-pack strawberry plants, and they were 4.99. Which is crazy cheap and we'd never had them before and of course we literally sold out in hours, but not before I grabbed three of them, bought them, and stashed them behind my register.

It was later that same day and a customer was buying some single plant strawberry plants from the same shipment, which were 3.99 each but much bigger than each little plant in the six-pack. She started complaining about how expensive these were per plant and points to the six-packs on a shelf behind me. She asks if we have any left.

""No, we sold out of those.""

""Well, are those for another customer?""

""Yes, I bought them."" (Probably a mistake to say but I wasn't expecting crazy.)

""YOU bought them?""

""Yes.""

""So I can still buy them!""

""No...""

""Why not? If you're the one who bought them, you work here, I can still buy them, it's not like another customer bought them.""

""Ma'am, I am an employee but I'm also a paying customer of this store. Things I buy from here are my property and you could buy them from *me* but I'm not selling them.""

""I don't understand. You're a part of this store. Please just give them to me, don't be difficult.""

""They're my property.""

""But you work for this store, so the store still owns them.""

""Look I'm not giving them to you, I'm sorry.""

""I'll be sending in a complaint. You can't lie about things being out of stock!""

clairewil,"Ma’am, please stop stripping that mannequin","This is a long one. This happened to me last year when I was working in the kidswear department of a large fast fashion store. For context, we have a team of visual merchandisers whose job it is to dress and position mannequins, and the garments on the models are pinned in place and often worked on for a long time so they sit just right and meet global standards. As such, sales associates aren’t allowed to touch the mannequins, and have to call one of the merchandisers if a customer wants an item off the models. 

So I’m serving, and a woman comes up to my till without being called. Fair enough, not everyone knows the system. I can hear her tapping her nails on till as I’m straightening the hangers behind me, so I’m already annoyed with her. I’ll be me, she’ll be Blonde Lady (BL):

Me: good evening, how can I help you? (She didn’t have any clothes to ring up, normally that means a stock inquiry) 

BL: I want the raincoat off the mannequin in the girls section. 

Me: ah, I’m sorry but all our merchandisers have gone home, I’ll have to get them to take it off tomorrow morning so you can pick it up. 

BL: no, I need it now. I’m not coming back tomorrow. 

Me: I’m actually not allowed to touch the mannequins, so I’ll just have to get the merchandisers to do it tomorrow morning. I can extend our normal hold time if that helps?

BL: it’s right over there, just take it off so I can buy it. 

At this point she’s clearly getting frustrated and I feel terrible, because I can see how dumb it looks if you don’t know how expensive the mannequins are and how much work goes into them (and how mad the merchandisers get when you screw with their models) 

Me: I’m so sorry, but I can’t take it off tonight. It’ll have to be tomorrow morning. 

BL: this is ridiculous. I’ve come from out of town and I’m not leaving without the raincoat.

Me: I can get you a manager if you like? 

BL: I don’t want a manager, I want the f**king raincoat. 

She storms off, and I think that’s the end of it. I let my manager know about the incident, in case I need to face a complaint later, and move on to serving other customers. But blonde lady is not finished yet. 

About five minutes later I hear someone over the radio saying “ummmmm kidswear people, there’s someone in your girls’ display taking the arms off a mannequin”. I apologise to the customers waiting and jog over to the section, where I find blonde lady in amongst the mannequins trying to wrestle the raincoat off a now armless mannequin. 

Me: Excuse me ma’am! You can’t do that! 

BL: No, I’m not having this, I’m taking this raincoat. 

I radio security, and then get to witness a big beefy guard chase this woman out of the mannequin stand. She’s shouting and swearing with kids around so I ask the guard to remove her from the store. He does, and I go back to the till. But somehow she’s still not done. 

I have no idea how, but this woman managed to sneak back in past security, find the raincoat that had been taken off her, and get all the way to the tills. Now if I were her, I would have gone to any other cashier, but I guess she wanted to be smug because she thought once I couldn’t prove she’d broken the rules I would have to serve her for some reason. So she comes up to my till, slams the raincoat down and grins at me. I pick up the raincoat, slowly walk to the returns cupboard and put it inside, then return to the desk. 

Me: I’m sorry ma’am, but you’re going to have to leave. 

BL: No, you have to serve me. Give me the coat. 

Me: I’m not going to serve you. 

My coworker has called security back at this point, so I just stand there and take the full frontal fury of this insane woman as she loses her mind over this raincoat. She’s swearing and screaming, practically foaming at the mouth, and she actually tries to throw a punch when the security guy gets there. I didn’t see her get ejected but apparently once the guards threatened to call the cops she finally left. 

The ironic thing is that the raincoat came back in stock like two days later. I slipped one into the cupboard just in case but funnily enough she never came back. ",TalesFromRetail,604,1532179282
iamhoppi,"""That's odd, your coupon won't work...""","First time posting here. 

To put things into context, I used to work for a major retailer. Frequent coupons were a big part of the company's business model. On this occasion, they had handed out sealed coupons for various amounts between $10 and $100. I believe each store only got 1 $100 coupon, and most of the rest were for $10. These days were typically stressful as they seemed to attract some of our worst customers.

While I'm at the register, an older lady (OL) walked up to purchase a few fashion jewelry items so she could use the $10 coupon that had been handed to her. I went through the transaction in a normal fashion, scanned her items, and then picked up her coupon and scanned it as well. I looked back at my screen, and for some reason, the system said that this coupon didn't qualify. I went through the items to make sure none of them were restricted and double-checked to make sure her total before tax is above $10. Everything seemed okay so I tried scanning the coupon again and got the same error message. I decided to check the coupon to make sure it was legitimate and what not. That's when I realize that the coupon was actually for $100 off.

I informed OL as to why her coupon wouldn't work. She was shocked, and incredibly happy about it so I told her to go pick out some more items. She came back with a handful of items, and I added them to the transaction. To our surprise, several of the items rang up lower than what they were marked at so she headed back out again. After a few more trips with similar results, she finally got her total over $100, and I finished out her transaction.

As I rang up her items, OL started to tear up, and thanked me for all of my help with her. She then asked me to call for a manager so she could give me a good review. As we waited for my manager, she began to tell me why she was crying. It turned out that she had just come from probate court where she had been dealing with the estate of a loved one who had recently died. On top of that OL's grandson was undergoing open heart surgery. The only reason OL came to the mall was to keep herself distracted from how stressed she was about the surgery. Eventually, my manager showed up, OL took a picture with me, and hugged me to thank me for helping her and talking with her. She went on her way, and I went back to work, this time with a real smile on my face.",TalesFromRetail,5340,1532149772
PmButtPics4ADrawing,If you put paper-thin objects on a moving conveyor belt without telling anyone they will fall into the abyss and be gone forever,"Was on register a while ago when I had what started out as a typical transaction. Woman came up, I greeted her, asked if she had a loyalty card and she simply said yes. She was still putting her stuff on the conveyor belt so I figured she'd give it to me after she was done. This is pretty common so I didn't think much of it and started scanning her things, promptly forgetting about the card.

Got to the end of her order and she had a question about a sale that didn't come off, at which point I remembered I still hadn't gotten her loyalty card. I asked for it, thinking she forgot.

&gt; Me: Oh, can I see your [store] card? I don't think I scanned it

&gt;Woman: I already gave it to you

uh... nope

&gt; Me: Sorry, I don't think I ever got it

&gt; Me: I don't have it over here...

&gt; W: Well I don't have it either, it's not in my wallet where I keep it! I gave it to you and I'd like my card back!

This goes back and forth for a few minutes. Eventually I get it out of her that she put her card on the conveyor belt, something she never mentioned until this point. The way our conveyor belt works is there's a thin slot where it leads in, and underneath that slot is a tray we can pull out for when thin items get sucked into it. I pull it out and lo and behold, there is her loyalty card. I scan it and hand it back to her, saying:

&gt; In the future just *hand* us your card; if you put it on the belt and we don't know about it, it can get sucked in

pigontherun,I’m so sorry about him,"I’ve never made a long post to reddit and every other post I’ve made, I think I’ve deleted
so apologies if anything is wrong.  I am also on mobile so sorry for format issues.

But anyways I’ve been working retail in the same jewelry/accessory store for 3 years.  One day, last winter, I saw this cute little older couple that seemed like they were having a hard time finding something so I went over and asked if they need help.  The wife showed me the headband in her hair and said, “I need more... all that you have, just like this.”   Unfortunately, I didn’t see any on the sales floor, so I told them that I would check in the back.  The husband said, “thank you, my name.”

I thought it was a little out of the ordinary that he referred to me as the name on my name tag, since no customers ever call you by your actual name.

I came from the back and told them that we had no more of the headband she wanted in the back either.  She was a little disappointed, but I showed her some different ones that she settled on buying instead.  After I checked them out, right as they were about to leave, the husband stopped and looked at me.  Before I could ask if he needed help with anything else, he asked if it was alright if he gave me a hug.

I was a little confused, but I think we’re all used to dealing with strange things in retail.  Also, I didn’t think he was hitting on me or anything like that, especially since his wife was standing right next to him so I agreed and gave him a hug.

He said, “Goodbye, my name” and immediately darted out of the store.

At this point I was just staring at his wife, who then said, “I’m so sorry about him... our daughter died in a car crash a few months ago.  She had the same name as you.  While you were in the back he was saying how much you reminded him of her.”  She then pulled out a picture of their daughter from her wallet to show me and I felt like someone had just stabbed me in the heart.",TalesFromRetail,2262,1531972441
munchkin123456,You'll be hearing from my lawyer!,"So this was about 12 years ago when I was still fairly fresh faced and happy to help every customer with a smile... this may not be as bad as some of the other ones I've seen on here, but 12 years later and I still remember it like it was yesterday. I used to work for a brand that sells everything from Clothes to food to home ware.

One day I was serving a customer who was buying a variety of home wares- pots/ cushions etc. probably amounting to around £200 total, not the biggest sale but by no means minuscule. Transaction is going well, I offered our company CC just in case she was a mystery shopper and hit all the points on my mental checklist of serving on the tills. 

We get to the payment part and her card declines, once, twice, three times... it cited auth code on the till - this was before the days of Chip &amp; PIN so she needed to call her bank.... apparently that wasn't satisfactory

Me: Me

CW: Crazy Woman

M: Manager

Me: I'm afraid it's saying you need to call your bank, unfortunately the card has declined

CW: try it again

Me: I've tried it three times, unfortunately it's giving me the same message, how about this, I can either hold the items for 24hrs here with your name on and you can get everything sorted with the bank, or alternatively if you have another form of payment I can get that through for you now.

CW: Well it must be your machines

Me: The machines have been working fine all day, the error message is specifying the card

CW: Get me your manager

*Manager is within earshot and had been keeping an eye on it so wanders over*

M: Is everything OK here? How can I help?

CW: Your card machines aren't working and SHE is saying it's my fault

M: Well let's see what we can do \*opens up next till and runs everything through\* unfortunately the card is not going through I'm afraid, do you have another form of payment with you? Otherwise we'll happily hold your items for 24hrs if you want to call your bank?

I had never seen my manager react to a customer ever... she was actually shaking! We never did hear from her lawyers, Head Office never told us if she complained (we'd have had a meeting about a customer complaint - those were taken seriously) but we did find out from another employee who had seen the whole thing happen that she came in a day later when me and my manager were off to buy the items - apparently her bank had sent out a new card ahead of that one expiring and deactivated the card without telling her....

dead-roses,When your customer can’t read social cues,"I’m a sales associate at a discount retail store, and I worked as a cashier today. The phone at the service desk rang, so I picked it up, since the other two cashiers were busy helping people. Our phone is by register #2, which is on the opposite side of the end of the queue line. Most sane customers will often wait at the end of the queue line patiently until they hear us press little buttons that say “cashier number x, please” when we’re ready for them, but there are a select few who seem to never understand the meaning of this organized and easy-to-understand system. This customer in particular today seemed to have fire ants or something in her pants, because she runs up to me and throws her items on the counter, looking expectantly on me. Keep in mind I didn’t press the button to call her down, she just waltzed on over upon her own annoyingly impatient desire. 

Yes, I’m standing behind register #2, but I’M ON THE PHONE. I AM LITERALLY TALKING. TO ANOTHER PERSON. ON THE PHONE. In other words, I AM BUSY. I am not conveying any physical or verbal signals that can be picked up as, “I am available to help you”. The customer proceeds to sigh as if I was doing something wrong, and I focus my efforts on ignoring her in order to focus on the customer on the phone, who I had been with way before I even set my eyes on this socially decrepit customer. 

Once I hang up, she scoffs at me when I tell her I can help her on register #4, my ASSIGNED register. The transaction continues with no enthusiasm on my part, just fast, efficient service, since she seems so eager to get out of the store.

I love it when customers literally cannot read social cues. ",TalesFromRetail,1305,1531893428
Kobolobob,Getting yelled at because customer forgot his receipt,"Hello, first time poster here, also from phone so sorry for any mistakes.

I work in an electronic store where most of our shtick is that we have a really small area for the customers to browse and a huge back room with shelves and stuff with more products, so if you have any questions, you ask us and we will fetch it for you aswell as try to educate you about your purchase if you want that. I have worked here for 3 years. 

Well this guy i smelled trouble from before I eaven saw him. M = Me and CD = Costumer Dude.

CD: That's the guy!

As I turn around I see CD pointing at me, I have not seen this person before at all eaven tho I think I'm pretty good at recognizing faces.

CD comes up to the counter and slams some wifi antenna still in the packaging on the counter. I take a careful look at it before I turn to CD

M: what can I help you with sir?

CD: It dosent fit, I want to return it and get the right one

He goes on to try to mime to me as I'm some sort of disabled person the type of connector he was supposed to be given, blaming my lack of knowledge. At the same time he is really working himself up, since I have no idea what he's trying to explain to me

M: What is this for sir?

A very safe question to ask I most cases since it usually ends up with customer actually explaining what he wants.

CD: some sort of radioamp I built myself, very standard connector! You should know!

I still have no clue what he's talking about, to buy time to think I ask for his receipt, since you know, that's proof of purchase and the brand he bought is sold in other stores close by aswell, so I need to verify that the purchase was done here.

M: Can I please see your receipt sir?

CD: I forgot it at home, but I know I bought it from you so you should remember me!

I still haven't seen this person before, usually I would just scan the product and give them store credit when they lose the receipt but I couldn't scan the item into my system and I couldn't find it anywhere on our store page anywhere so I couldn't manually enter it either, so if he really bought it here I would need the receipt to get the product number, since ""dead"" products we have replaced with something else dosent appear on the store website unless you have the old product number so we can manually insert it into our register and find it. 

M: I'm sorry sir I'm afraid I don't recall you, but I still need to see the receipt so I can insert the product (and confirm you bought it here) into my register

CD fucking explodes and begins yelling at me for tricking him into buying something he can't use and that we are just a bunch of dumbasses that know nothing. I try to calmly explain to the customer again that I just need to see the receipt but no, he showes the antenna up in my face while up in my face while threatening to break it and never comming back again

All I manage to say is: ""you should do that then"" because I'm really at it to keep myself from lashing out

He just looks at me stupid and starts leaving while uttering curses and telling people not to come in here. On his way out he mentions he was here just before closing the day before, when I wasn't working... 

I really don't understand customers, this was a easily solvable situation but he blew it way out of proportions just because he manages to forget the receipt. Good thing I usually have thick skin

TLDR: customer tries to exchange an item without a receipt, I said I needed it because various reasons, customer explodes and yells at me and my lack of experience and leaves

thehorsefromnl,"Lady tries to steal, and throws a tantrum when confronted, making things worse, ending up in a police car","On mobile, sorry for formatting errors

I work as a cashier/shift manager in a grocery store. In our store, people need to bring produce to the register, where we will weigh and price it for them, or just scan the item when it is individually priced. One of these items is lettuce, which comes in opaque bags with an open top. A middle aged lady, we'll call her LL for lettuce lady, loads all of her groceries on the belt, and I start to scan. When I reach for the lettuce, I feel something strange, it turns out lettuce lady had stacked 3 lettuces inside this bag. When I confronted her, she said she just grabbed the bag from the shelf. So I called in our produce clerk (PC).
 
The conversation went like this:

Me to PC: this lady said she found a bag with 3 lettuces stuffed inside, isn't that strange?

PC: Yes it is, as lettuces are only sold individually (LL starts to turn red)

LL: (classic incoming) I want to speak to your manager immediately.

I proudly introduce myself as manager to LL, which made matters even worse because she just threw a tantrum a 3 year old would be jealous of. The tantrum started with tearing off the bag with her teeth, and throwing the lettuces to the floor, smashing them with her feet, I tell her to calm down, which only works as fuel on her already raging fire.

She then starts to throw things from the belt into the store. This was the point where I called in security, and told PC to phone the police. This makes her more angry, so when security arrives, she f*cking spits all over our security guard and my register, and tries to punch both me and the guard in the face. The guard eventually manages to tackle LL and keep her immobile until police arrived.

She then was arrested. When she was dragged out of the store, she starts to scream things about out customer service all over the place. She ended up in the back of a police cat, because 
1. She was too cheap to pay the extra 75 cents for the lettuces, which were on sale anyways

2. She was too stubborn and self-proud to admit her lame try to steal one of the cheapest items in our store like any sane adult would do. 


Tl;dr woman tries to steal freaking lettuce, and makes such a big fuss, we had police come over to arrest her.",TalesFromRetail,3546,1531769001
backingawayslowlynow,Why would you be proud of doing that with your ID?,"I once worked at a convenience store, that had an ID everyone policy on tobacco products.

One day, two guys come in, and ask to buy some cigarettes. For clarity we will call them ID Guy and Proud Guy. Proud Guy is telling ID Guy what to buy, so I tell them I have to ID them both, since the one is clearly paying for the other.

ID Guy proceeds to earn his name by, sanely and calmly, pulling out his ID and handing it to me. Proud Guy proceeds to earn his name by smugly crossing his arms and beginning the following interaction:

Proud Guy: ""You can't ID me because I don't have an ID, so there!""

First guy is looking at him weird, and so am I because why would you be proud of that? I mean this guy was REALLY proud of this fact, like he had figured out how to trick the system or something and whatever was I, a lowly cashier, going to do now.

ID Guy: ""Dude, what are you doing? I know for a FACT that you have ID. You had to use it to get into the club a few weeks ago, so you need to just show it already."" 

Me:"" If you have ID, you need to show me, because if you don't, I can't sell anything to either of them in the realm of tobacco products today, at all.""

Proud Guy's face falls, and he starts to lose a bit of his smug demeanor.

Proud Guy: ""I could just leave and you could sell it to ID Guy!"" 

Me: ""No, I can't. You are clearly here together and I heard you both talking about making this purchase.""

The ID Guy is losing his patience at this point.

ID Guy: ""Just show your ID already, we have places to be!""

Proud Guy: ""I can't...I don't have it anymore.""

ID Guy: ""What do you MEAN you don't have it anymore?""

Proud Guy suddenly swelled with pride again at this, as though he was about to tell us both a great thing in his life he was keeping secret. Like winning the lottery, or getting into a prestigious university. 

Proud Guy: ""I sold it!""

Both ID Guy and I look at him for a minute and simultaneously said: ""WHAT?!?""

Proud Guy: ""Yeah, I met some guys that offered me $150 for my ID, can you believe it? So, I sold it last week.  It's no big deal, I'll just get a new one, probably sell that one too!""

ID Guy: ""It's a super big deal, dude! Why would you do that? You're an idiot!"" 

Me: ""I have to agree with him, man. They are going to steal your identity, and you're going to be pretty fucked, if you're not already. You should really call the police, and your bank, and probably do a credit check to figure out the damages so far.""

Proud Guy starts to go pale, turns to ID Guy, and says ""That isn't true, right?""

ID Guy takes his ID back from me, shakes his head, and pulls Proud Guy out of the store, with Proud Guy looking like he is about to cry.

I never saw Proud Guy again, and I never asked ID Guy about it when he came in a couple times after that.

OMG_A_Thing,You bought that mower last week? Really?,"So I recently got out of my retail job and into a job as a Network Engineer (what my degree is in)! To commemorate, here is a wonderful story about my last day at work. Also on mobile, so blah blah blah. 

I worked bookkeeping at my retail job, but since that only took me about half of my scheduled shift, I’d go work the floor or the service desk to finish my hours. On my last day, I chose to do service desk, mostly because one of my friends was working the desk too.

ML is mower lady. Me is me. L is friend. R is another employee that works service desk. Also it’s been a rather rainy, bleh day. 

L is working one of the returns register and a middle aged woman walks in with her well-used mower. L calls out to her and begins the transaction. 

ML: I just bought the mower last week and now it won’t even start. I am in a hurry so can I just return it and get a different one. 

L: since it’s within our return policy for gas powered products, we can do that, we just need a receipt. 

ML: i don’t have the receipt, but can you look it up on [store] credit card? I’m not sure if I bought it on my [store] credit card or my husbands. 

L: We can look, but I cannot return gas powered products without a receipt. 

ML, starting to get angry: I know your return policy, that’s why I brought it back now and not in a month. I don’t know what your accusing me of. 

Me, inwardly: this is going to be a good one. 

L, calm and courteous: ma’am I was just letting you know our policy. Go ahead and swipe your credit card and I pull your receipt. 

ML does so, while muttering under her breath.

L: it’s not coming up under this card. Are you an authorized buyer on your husband’s card?

ML, comes uncorked: this is unacceptable. I came out here an a rainy day. I packed up this mower BY MYSELF and brought it all the way here! Give me store credit! I AM NOT DEALING WITH THIS TODAY!

Me, since it’s me last day, to my customers, loudly: thanks for being great customers! I hope you have an amazing day since you guys have been so great!

Customer, loudly: I hope you get through your day without dealing with the crazies, although it doesn’t appear that’ll happen. 

ML gives them a death glare.

L, still being professional: we cannot take this mower back unless we have a receipt. We can give you store credit, but not without a receipt. 

ML: I know R! R is my best friend and she wouldn’t let me be treated this way. 

I had to walk around the corner because I know R and R would smack one of her friends upside the head for behaving this way. R is an older lady who doesn’t let people mistreat other people. 

L: ma’am, if you go down to tool rental, they can take a look at your mower. 

ML: manager. I want a manager now. R wouldn’t let this happen. 

L calls for the manager. ML decides she isn’t going to stand around while everyone stares at her.

ML goes to tool rental and about 5 minutes later runs out of the store like she was trying to outrun the zombie apocalypse. 

I walk down to tool rental to get the full story. They pulled the manufacturers warranty and saw that it expired in 2006. Upon confronting ML, she spewed cuss words and left. ",TalesFromRetail,2596,1531665464
tentsintense,No- We do not accept Hair returns,"A few years ago I worked at a Beauty Supply Store where the average Joe/Sue/Sally could walk in and purchase their off brand hair supplies, hair dye, extensions, and acrylic supplies.  We also offered a special customer card to professionals.  The story I'm sharing today is a story revolving around your regular dumb Sally.

See, Sally was an acquaintance of mine, we had similar friends, and she seemed ok - very stuck up and unknowing of how the world works, but...ok enough.  Sally was in the market for some new extensions, and we sold some pretty decent quality ones for about $100, with a VERY strict ""no return"" policy that we were required to state at the time of purchase and it was listed on the back of EVERY receipt, regardless of what you purchased.

So Sally is looking at extensions, and I'm showing her the hair, and comparing it to the hair on her head.  She's in love! buys the damn hair that matches perfectly. 

That weekend, I find out she decided to drunkenly dye her hair a purple/brown tone, that is pretty dark, especially in contrast to her bleach blonde barbie hair that she was growing out.

Guess who wanted to return that wasted $100 set of extensions?

If you guessed Sally - you get half a cookie.  If you guessed Sally's grandmother who was not there when she made this stupid purchase - you get a whole box of cookies because somehow you can read minds.

Well Irate Granny shows up and our conversation went something like this 

M : Me

IG : Irate Granny

*cue scene

IG : I'd like to get a refund on these extensions my grandaughter just bought last week

M : Oh, i'm sorry, but it is company policy that we do not allow returns for any type of hair.

IG : the woman that sold these to my grandaughter told me when we bought them that we could get a refund if we didn't like them, and I expect you to honor that

M : *looking at receipt for the date of service and realize that the customer was f**king Sally - Ma'am, I was the ones that sold these to Sally, and I told her then and there that there are no refunds, and made sure she wanted to make this purchase.

IG : you were NOT f**king there, I.WAS. so if you don't refund me RIGHT NOW, I want to talk with your manager

M : right away!!!! &lt;3 (The manager proceeded to state the same thing, and pointed out the multiple places where NO REFUNDS ON HAIR is written on the receipt with a highlighter)

Later on I ended up running into F**king Sally, and chewed her a new butthole as I had received a bad review through corporate over her not freaking listening to me.  Pointed out how her B of a grandmother nicely forgot to point out how she was trying to return something that was freaking unreturnable, and made it seem like I was refusing her service.  I pointed out how crappy it was of her to do something like to this to anyone, and I don't care if she is new to my hand shaped state, straight out of cali, you don't crap on people because you stupidly decided to dye your hair a dark color right after blowing $100 on freaking extensions.  Thankfully she didn't return to any beauty supply store that I worked in.",TalesFromRetail,836,1531515912
Glossophile22,Kill them with kindness,"So I work in a medium sized upmarket supermarket that is never usually too busy. 

However today I was working at the checkout of a baskets only checkout, and I had just finished serving a sweet old lady of around 80 or so. She was a bit slow gathering her things together (walking stick, purse, bags, etc.) so I just politely waited and smiled, and usually the customer behind also waits for the person to finish, however...

'Rude Lady' literally storms forward and slams her basket down on the counter, nearly knocking the old lady over before she can gather her things together. Old lady takes a few more moments to gather her things, and I wait for her to move out of the way, much to the irritation of the rude lady. (RL = rude lady, M = me)

&gt;RL: Come on, start packing
&gt;M: *smiling* I'll just wait for madam to finish getting her things &gt;together..- Ah, there we are. (I start packing the lady's bags)
&gt;RL: *audible sighing, tutting, sighing*
&gt;M: *continues smiling* Is everything alright?
&gt;RL: I just didn't think i'd have to wait in a place like this, this is &gt;really unacceptable, to keep people standing around.
&gt;M: *continues to smile and packs bags, nodding along to what the &gt;lady says*
(At this point RL snatches her bags and begins packing herself, I would say she probably broke half her goods by the way she was slamming her groceries in her bags)
(Awkward silence while RL finishes packing her own bags)
&gt;M: *smiling* Do you have a loyalty card?
&gt;RL: *mumbling* oh for fuck sake
&gt;M: *ignores the swearing* That'll be £35.38

&gt;RL: I'm going to report you to your manager! You are so &gt;patronising and useless! You stupid fucking moron. go fuck &gt;yourself.
&gt;M: *smiles widely* thanks you too, have a great weekend.

At this point her face was bright red and she looked like she was going to have a total meltdown, thankfully she stomped off. But I really don't get why some people are so rude and aggressive for the sake of it. The one thing i've found is just to continually be sweet and smile, as it irritates them more than reacting negatively.",TalesFromRetail,688,1531514620
PoorCashier,"""Don't open that bag!""","Hello fellow Redditors. Another story for you.


BG: In our store we, among many other items, also sell freshly baked bread. We have lots of different kinds which look very smiliar, but have significant differences on their upper side so we cashiers can identify them and know what to charge the customer for. 

We also have bags in which you can put this bread. One side is transparent, the other side isn't. The logical thing would be to put the bread in the bag so that its upper side faces the transparent side of the bag, so it's easy to identify.


Well, today I had a customer who acted against that logic. Hence I had to open the bag to take a look inside. Following conversation occured.


Me: *tries to open bag without ever touching the bread with my bare hands*

Customer: Don't open it!

Me: But I have to look inside. I can't make out which bread you want to buy by looking at the lower side of it.

Customer: But I don't want you to touch it! It's *bread name* what I'm buying!

Me: I'm sorry, but it's demanded from me to take a look inside. Many customers get the bread kinds wrong. I won't touch the bread in any way, only the bag.

Customer: This is unacceptible! Just type in *bread name* I know my bread!

Me: Mam, I can't do this. I literally signed for taking a look inside bread bags 

(When things in the store change, due to management decisions, we get the news told by a manager and then have to sign that we will act accordingly to the management decisions in the future. The bread bag checks are one of those things. And trust me: They check if you do it or not)


Customer: This is ridiculous! I don't want you to touch it!

Me: Then do you want to open the bag and just show it to me without me touching it?

Customer: Why do you have to make it so complicated! It's just bread!


After a bit back and fourth (which was way top frustrating) a manager noticed the ruckus and took over. She basically told the customer the same thing and in the end the customer showed the bread to us while looking really embarassed and being quiet. Turns out she tried to steal make-up by hiding it in the bread bag. Never saw a customer turn that red. But at least all that craziness had a reason.


Not to mention the customer got a warning to never pull such a stunt again. Next time she does it she won't be allowed into the store again for a while.

Well anyway I was using the machine and we only had like 2 maybe 3 cart guys at the time. So I'm hitting rows and usually some people will take their cart and go ahead and put it on the machine, and I'm grateful for those people. However, when I was pushing some carts on this one row, this kid probably 10 years old, took the empty cart and pushed it over to me, so I grabbed it and said ""Thanks little man"". Well next thing I know, he's in the coral grabbing more to put on the end. So I grabbed what he handed to me, and went back to his family. I move the machine up a little so I can get the next coral, then the kid comes up with another cart that his family had used. He saw how I was pushing multiple carts so as I added the carts to machine he went to try and push multiple carts at a time as well but he was struggling with it, so I said ""I appreciate the help, but let me get those, you can grab that one."" and he grabbed another single cart.

SnowFaerie,Heartbreaking Moment Today,"I work in a Canadian bookstore.


A couple months ago, an elderly woman and her adult son came into our store. The elderly woman asked me to help her find a book on writing a will. Now, this woman must've been 90 or so. She knew her time was coming and was getting ready for it. At this point, I didn't know her son was with her as he was browsing a different section.


It takes nearly 20 minutes to find this book because we have only one in stock and our reference section looks like a tornado went through it. But I finally found it right as her son came up. I helped him find a book about coping when a loved one has cancer. I figured his mother had cancer and the whole thing absolutely broke my heart.


Shortly before my break today, the elderly woman comes into the store. She's returning the book about writing wills. She'd bought it for her son. He'd never got the chance to use it. 


She remembered me and thanked me several times for working so hard to help them. Even though our return period is 14 days, I returned the book for her. She told me she wouldn't need it because he was the only person in her life and she didn't really have any possessions.

Me: (*Vgkjfdyhcfhnbg* searching in our store device, typed in wax paper, says we have 29 on the floor in the aisle) Okay it says we have some so if you want to follow me we can go and look for it together. (I have been smiling and have been super nice through this whole interaction) 

Lady: No, I already looked and you don’t have it so feel free to go check out what I already know for yourself and I’ll be in the ice cream if you need me. (she proceeds to walk away)

I look at buddy and smile we walk over to the aisle where it said they would be and I kid you not, right NEXT to the parchment paper.... on the TOP shelf are at least 20 containers on WAX paper.

Me: Hmmm how many do you think she needs????

Buddy: One, just grab one..

Me: I think she needs all 20 of them!!! What do you think?

Buddy: (laughs) oh god no just get one 

Me: (grabs 3 of them and finds lady) Hello, I wasn’t sure how many you needed so I grabbed three just in case (I’m smiling from ear to ear)

Lady: (looks up from her phone and see’s the wax paper in my hands) oh my goodness where did you find those???! 

Me: In the aisle. They were on the top shelf next to the parchment paper so that could have been why you missed them (cause you didn’t f’n look above your eye line)

Lady: oh gosh you must be feeling pretty good right now, making me eat my words.

She takes two of the wax paper containers and I end up accidentally running into her a couple more times throughout the night. Each time her face got super red. It was a good night.",TalesFromRetail,3693,1531320709

Twizzler26,The customer's wife came in specifically to find me,"So this happened a long time ago in my old job at a high street jewelers in the UK but I think about the interaction a lot so wanted to share!  I was working on the shop floor and an elderly gentleman and his daughter came in and started looking at the bracelets and bangles. To give some perspective this isn’t a prestige jewelers; unless something had a diamond in it, the most you could look to spend was £300-£400. 

After giving them a few minutes to look I went over and asked if they need any help. The gentleman said he was looking for a bangle for his wife for their anniversary but he wasn’t sure what to go for. I brought them over to the table and chairs and let him have a sit while I took ten or so bangles and bracelets out of the display for him to have a look at. I brought them over and explained the difference between the metals, the clasps etc, let him hold them, try them on his daughter to see how they looked on the wrist. That sort of thing. I probably spent about 40 minutes with them helping them choose something.   

He landed on something he liked and left happy with a new bangle for his wife. Such a nice man and it was a pleasure to see him off with something he liked.  

Skip to the following Saturday and I was on the shop floor again. A lady comes in looking around for something so I head over and ask if she needs anything. She clocks my name badge and says “ahh, are you chap that helped my husband pick out this bangle?” It was the wife of the gentleman I helped and she had come into town to find me specially to say thank you for “spending so much time with him to pick out such a lovely present” and how much she loved it. Apparently it had meant so much to the old timer he told her all about the experience in store. He had no idea really what he was looking for and I was just pleased to help guide him through the minefield that can be women’s jewelry!  

I’d never had such warm fuzzies working in that shop and still I think about it a lot!",TalesFromRetail,6573,1531224282

Guy comes in. M is me G is guy.
 
M: How you doing today?

G: (grunts something and grabs his item)

M: Will that be all for you today?

Azukus,“You know how I have to have my groceries!I’m a military mom”,"It’s 5AM and I can’t sleep. Typing this on mobile, might have to reformat after submitting.
I work at a grocery store in the south that revolves around customer service and kissing asses.

Anyway, this old lady starts unloading her cart onto my conveyor belt. She unloads half her cart, puts down the checkout divider, and then she unloads the other half. The checkout divider in this situation is a universal sign for two separate transactions. I’m a cautious man, however. I ask this seemingly nice lady if these were two separate transactions. Boy, oh boy, was I wrong.

This lady turns to our assistant customer service manager, who happened to be bagging for me. “He must be new here.” She turns back at me with her smug face and tells me, “I like to have my groceries in a specific way. Put all of these in one bag.” She wouldn’t shut up. The divider didn’t do a damn thing either because she would use her hand to stop me from scanning and she’d tell my assistant manager what items go in certain bags together. Then, she’d lift her hand for me to continue. Fuck this lady. That’s what I thought, at least. 

I kept scanning. My assistant manager didn’t say a word, so I didn’t either. I just did my thing to get this decaying harlot outta here as soon as possible. I persevere and manage to get through all of the items just to see her smirk. “Sorry, but you know how I have to have my groceries.” She stares at me dead center in the essence of my soul, “I’m a military mom.”

I let that process through my head as I go on autopilot. “Ms. Assistant Manager would be more than happy to take this out for you ma’am! Thank you for shopping with us, we hope to see you again!” She’s gone and I was left with that last sentence. Her children are in the military, so she has to have her groceries bagged in a particular way? I just can’t wrap my head around this tomfoolery ok",TalesFromRetail,3026,1531131276
Biggaymistake,Dude blocked me running to my bus because he needed assistance.,"On my phone, you know the deal.

So yesterday was that big England football game, eh? I finished my shift right in the middle of it so my dad couldn't pick me up. No Biggie I'll take the bus.

I decided to leave a few minutes earlier since I missed my 30 minute break, coworker was cool with it. Hell yea.

I go get ready to leave and clock out dead of 4:30 and head straight for the bus stop across the road from my shop. My bus isn't there, but the board say it'll be here at 4:36 so I go a great a treat from a bakery right next to the stop, that's when I realize I forgot my bottle.

Its 4:33 so I sprint back into the store, looked in the deli for my bottle before remembering I left it in the breakdown upstairs. Fuck.

I grab it and sprint out of the shop. At this point it's important to know my uniform isn't suitable for the hot weather, but more for working in a cold deli all day, long sleeves, thick jackets, you know, plus I was dehydrated cause I'm dumb, so I was very much dying.

When I get outside I'm sweating and clearly panicked, especially when I see my bus waiting at the stop, so I keep running but get stopped by a random guy with his friends. He points behind me to the store and starts saying something like ""Where can I find-""

I'm just like dude I'm off the clock and about to miss my bus sorry, and run across the road before my bus leaves (it didn't! The bus driver was very sympathetic at my dumbass).

But it just baffled me?? Why did he think I would show him where something was? I had no name badge on, had my bright rainbow bag and shopping bags with me and my phone in hand. I'm clearly rushing somewhere?? It happened yesterday and I'm still confused.

misscrochetfingers,The napkin ring,"Another story reminded me of this from the other day:

Had a customer give to her teething child a napkin ring to chew on as they walked around the store (the napkin ring was round and made out of a wicker/rattan woven material). As they walked around the store the child was still chewing on this thing.

Finally they come to the cash desk to pay for some items and I notice the napkin ring is no where to be found. As I finish ringing everything through, I ask them about the napkin ring the child was chewing on. The mother claims the daughter never had it in her mouth (child was playing with it like it was a rattle).

Thankfully, my other worker who has impeccable timing brought to me a sopping wet napkin ring hidden behind a vase on a shelf.

I looked at the mother and she went beet red. I told her I would be charging her for the napkin ring (she thankfully did not out up a fight). I wrapped it up in a tissue cause I don't know what germs her child had and put it in the bag.

Wished her a good night and she went on her way.

Jendomlover,I hate children*.," \*I don't hate children. This child wasn't even at fault. Still...

I've had many versions of this interaction over the years, but I'm going to tell you about this particular one just for the ending.  
Our shop sells, among many other things, various brightly coloured plastic pieces of tat designed to appeal to children. The particular one in this story is a ball covered in spikes with a small light inside. The kids love it. I don't, largely because the lights break at the slightest provocation.  
On a late night a while ago, I'm starting my final tidy around when some customers come in. That's alright, they still have time. I greet them and keep working. There's two women, a walking around child and a child in a buggy. One of the women grabs one of these balls and give it to the Buggy Child to amuse her while they focus on finding a book for the older child. The ball, naturally, goes straight in the child's mouth. It's far too big to swallow, they're keeping an eye in case she chews a spike off, it's all good. Right?  
AHAHAHAHAH no.  
They come to the counter with a book. We make some small talk; they are the aunts of the children, apparently, babysitting for a while. I scan the book and put it in a bag.  
""And the ball?"" I'm already moving to ring it in manually.  
Woman #1 looks at the ball jammed halfway into Buggy Child's mouth. ""Oh, I didn't mean her to get that.""  
...woman, I *saw* you with my very own eyes hand it to her.  
Woman #1 takes the gooey, slobbery ball from Buggy Child and abandons it on a random display. Buggy Child starts screaming. Woman #2 gives me the stink eye, like this is my fault.  
I finish out the sale. I am professional, but curt. As they leave, I go to the display, pick up the ball by one spike between finger and thumb, and head for a counter that has clothes and spray to clean this with.  
Woman #2 has seen me. ""Oh my god, she's holding it like *this!* What does she think is going to happen? That's so funny! What a weirdo!""  
I came very close to telling her all about my (thankfully, non-existent) immune deficiency, but it felt like tempting fate. I just threw that thing in a bucket of bleach instead.

On the counter? Why?

&gt;No, the scale.

The scale? Why?

&gt;I want to weigh it.

The weight is on the package. The scale wouldn't tell you the right weight anyway, because it doesn't know how to remove the packaging.

No, the weight on the package- *I point at it*- is right here...I don't understand what you're getting it.

&gt;I want to **CHECK**.

laisserai,It's only 6 cents anyways!,"I work at a fairly large grocery store. Along with basic groceries we also have clothing, electronics etc. I do a lot of things but one of them is to check prices when a customer asks.

VAC: very angry customer
M: me
Cashier: cashier
CE: Clothing Employee
CM: Clothing Manager

Cashier had called me because VAC pajama bottoms were scanning up as $14.00, there was an clearance sticker that said $13.94. I was annoyed on the inside as this was a difference of 6 cents but whatever, thats my job, I went off to the clothing department on the hunt for these pants.

Once I got to the clothing department I saw CE. Because the clothing department is very large I asked CE to help me find the pants. As she was finding them I explained the situation to her. She showed me the pants that were all $14.00 and none of them had clearance stickers on them.

&gt;CE: I think the customer might have put the sticker on these pants, none of the other pants are discounted and they shouldn’t be either. They just came in. She should get them for $14.00
&gt;M: Okay, sounds good.

I go back to the cashier and explain the situation. I never stated that the customer put a sticker on. I just said the sticker shouldn’t be on these pants and they are full price because they are new.

&gt;VAC: I’ll show you the pants!! You’re lying to me! 

We walk to the clothing department. The CE sees VAC and I walking and she notifies CM. VAC is running around the pajama section trying to find the pants. She keeps walking past them. 

&gt;CM (who was notified by CE of the situation): The pants you’re looking for are right here.
&gt;VAC: No! These pants are not discounted mine are.
&gt;CM: Maam, I’m sorry but these pants should not be discounted. Only these (points to clearance section) pants are.
&gt;VAC: I DON’T LIKE THE INSUATION THAT I PUT THE CLEARANCE STICKER ON THESE PANTS.
&gt;CM: Maam no one said you did.
&gt;CE: Whats the difference? 6 cents?
&gt;Me: Yep…

VAC is still angrily looking through all the pants for a clearance sticker.
&gt;Me (speaking to CM): What price should the pants be? I need to notify the cashier.
&gt;CM: They will be $14.00. Maam, they will be $14.00.
&gt;VAC: Okay, it’s only 6 cents anyways! I must have made a mistake! No big deal.

CM and I look at each other, shocked at this sudden change of emotion.

VAC and I walk back t the cashier.

&gt;Cashier: So, what is the price?
&gt;Me: It is $14.00, we spoke with the clothing manager.
&gt;VAC: Technically you have to give it to me for $13.94!!! I will NOT pay $14.00!!!!!

At this point I was shocked. Less than a minute ago she said she was fine with it.
The cashier ended up calling the CM who, clearly annoyed, just let her have it for $13.94. I was at customer service when VAC was walking out and right before she left, she made eye contact with me and stuck her tongue out!

Yerfsmaddaw,The BBC!!,"  This was back when I was a supervisor of a small high street store in the UK. At this point we were in between managers and because I had been there for a while I was basically left to run the store (at no extra pay, mind you) for a couple of month while they dug up a new manager. 

I was working a close on a standard nothing of a Wednesday, just me and one other member of staff who had been working in the store for about a week. She was still getting used to everything and to be honest I just wanted to go home. We all know the feeling. 

It’s coming up to closing time so about 10 minutes before we actually close I tell the new girl to let the 3 people who were browsing that we will be closing soon. 

Ok only 8 minutes until I lock the doors… 5 minuets….3….1…that’s it. By this time the browsers had left and the shop was empty. The day had dragged and I was ready to go home. 

Then… out of the mists she appeared. It’s a sight to strike despair into the hearts and minds of retail workers across the world. An old Biddy. A little over five feet high, she looked like she had just fallen out of a John Lewis catalogue and she had the attitude to match.

I don’t remember the rest of the conversation as my mind kept skipping back to her indignation  as she waved her watch at me “MY WATCH IS SET TO THE BBC!” over and over.

mynameiswrong,"Nod and frown boys, nod and frown","A while ago I was called to the front by one of my co-workers who said a customer wanted to talk to a manager. When I got up there I found an angery looking guy with his shopping cart of groceries already paid for and by the bagging counter. 

Me: Hi, how can I help you?  

Guy: Yes I want to complain about *that* cashier! (Pointing a finger at one of my best associates who is also a great at running register)  

Me: Ok, what's wrong?  

Guy: She just *threw* my stuff in the cart! She could have damaged my food! I pay for it she should be more careful!  

Me: Ok, was anything damaged? I can replace it if it was.  

Guy: No, but it was rude. She should be reprimanded! Are you going to talk to her?!  

Me: Ok, I will when she's not on register. 

Guy: If you don't talk to her I'm going to complain to headquarters. This is terrible service, your cashiers should know better.  


Now, our company is known for being fast. The company times the associates ring speeds. It's literally the training to not grab items but to slide them across the register and off the register into the customers cart. You're supposed to stop the fall with your right hand open, but not grab the item unless it's breakable or bread. None of the customer's items had been damaged so the associate had actually followed policy. However, if a complaint goes through corporate they send it to the dm who sends it to the store manager with the instruction to respond back with proof of resolvement. Basically it's almost guaranteed to result in a write up. I decided to try to prevent that.

Me: Ok, I understand sir. One minute.  

I walked over to my coworker and got pretty close so that I could quietly talk to her.  

Me: Hey, so that customer that you see right over there? (I pointed behind me to the customer) I'm going to talk to you for a little bit about him, ok? Alright great. ( I started shaking my head 'no') So just listen to me and keep nodding. Great, can you frown a little? Perfect. Alright, keep up the good work, just give me a minute until I get this guy to leave.  

My coworker was initially confused but caught on pretty quick. I walked back over to the guy who of course had hung around to see the lowly ""cashier"" get admonished.   

Me: Ok sir, is there anything else I can do for you? 

Guy: No, but keep an eye on her.  

Me: Ok. Have a great day.

C: *Makes motion to get up* 

AC: Keep working, I just wanted to let you know that I've asked for the store manager.

- AC walks back up just as the manager comes - 

AC talks to the manager for a few minutes and then joins the back of the queue with the manager.

M: Process the overcharge, Josephd98. 

M to AC: this will take a few moments.

Me to AC: You can insert your card to refund the amount whenever you're ready. Sorry about the delay.

- I staple a slip to say the overcharge has went through - 

AC: Thanks.

------The manager stands behind me while I get rid of the queue -----

M to Me: What happened there?

*I retell the whole story*

M to Me: She told me a different story about how she was next in line and two people walked in front of her and you served her.

Me: No, that is definitely not what happened.

M to Me: Sorry that you had to deal with that.

Me to M: Don't worry about it, it's what I'm paid for (sarcastically).



*TLDR* Customer expected me to let her skip the queue to serve her, then lies and says she was skipped in the queue.

animallover2472004,My first frustration from my home run bakery.,"Mobile format apologies. First time poster. Yada yada.

I run a small home bakery on the side of my normal full time job that specializes in iced sugar cookies. I get a lot of orders from friends and family, but I do get a good amount of business as well from strangers. I prefer business from strangers, because I find it easier to say no/put my foot down on prices, designs, time frames etc.

Yesterday, I get a message through my bakery’s Facebook page from my step-mom’s niece, whom I also went to high school with. She asked for 18 cookies for her 5 year wedding anniversary, by Friday.

Now if this were my full time gig, that doesn’t seem unreasonable, but I do this as a side job so I still work 40+ hours a week. Also 4th of July is tomorrow, so this is a pretty hectic week for me. And iced sugar cookies take a good chunk of time to do. Baking the cookies in itself is easy, but the decorating takes several hours of work. 

I asked her a few questions to see what she wanted, design wise. Her response to every question was, “IDK, Be Creative”. This is frustrating to me because I like to make sure my customers are getting what they want, and if they don’t give me any kind of guideline, I can’t guarantee their satisfaction. But reluctantly, I agreed to do the cookies for her and I figured I’d just test out some new designs I’ve been wanting to try.


I followed up by asking her when she would like to pick the cookies up. She responded around 5AM and she said Friday preferably. I told her that was no problem, but because I work during the day, she could pick them up on Friday after 6PM from my home, and I provided her with the address.


Now this is what really gets me. I live pretty close to the city, right on the northern edge of our state. Now, she lives no more than 30 minutes south from me. Once I let her know that she could pick them up after 6 on Friday, she said “I don’t know if I can make it up to *city* on Friday, are you coming south this weekend?”
I followed up with a firm no (I stopped delivering without charging a delivery fee), and she told me to hold off on the cookies to see if she can figure something out, which was the second point of annoyance to me because after I got her initial message asking for the cookies, and anticipating how busy this week is going to be, I went ahead and baked the cookies last night so that I could get them completed early, so I didn’t have to worry about getting them done during the July 4th festivities.

At that point, I wanted to just tell her sorry, I cant do them for you unless you can pick them up, but I ended up telling her that the best I could do was to give the cookies to my dad (who works a few blocks away from me downtown) and that she could pick them up from his house over the weekend, which she agreed to.


I’m just flabbergasted that she had the nerve to ask me to drive the cookies to her, when I’m already doing her a favor by making them for her on such short notice, with no guidance from her on what she wants. Maybe I’m wrong to be annoyed, but I feel like if I’m doing you a favor, and taking time out of my busy holiday week to make these last minute for you, you should be willing to drive an extra 10 minutes to pick up your cookies.


I’m sure I’ll have more of these stories to come, but so far, this has been my first incident in the almost year that I have been doing this.",TalesFromRetail,1468,1530630382
KuroTintedHeart,"It's been fifteen minutes, and for the last time, the $25 cushion is not the same as the $8 one","Hi! Lurker here who just got a job in retail. I love it, and most everybody is super nice. But already I have a handful of crazy people that make for fairly interesting stories. One of these stories is of the Crazy Cushion Lady.

I met CCL while I was shadowing the worker at self checkout. Fairly easy, just help scan customers' items, check the screen to make sure nobody's trying to buy a $200 power tool with a barcode of a $14 wrench (which is a story for another time. Maybe). Sometimes an item would be off by a dollar or two, usually because there were new tags added and the new price hadn't been put in the system yet, and I'd have to check the tags or suspend the order while they went to take a photo of the tag.

So when the lady with a cart piled high with cushions and throw pillows said that the cushions were more expensive than they were on the shelf, it wasn't unusual. What was unusual was how *much* she thought the price was off by.

She rung up a cushion that came up as around $25, and then insisted that it was really only eight dollars. the woman I was shadowing looked at me and just shook her head, and I went over to help the woman.

I thought I could handle it. I'd helped a few people with similar issues, and it always turned out fine as long as I just apologized for the confusion, showed concern, and helped them sort it out and/or offered an alternative. 

I was a fool. An absolute, goddamn fool.

For the first five minutes it was just me scanning items and then voiding them as she checked the prices, insisting they were all wrong. Scan, check, return to the main computer, line item void, rinse, repeat. There are plenty of places in the store for checking prices, and the self checkout is not one of them. Mainly because the key word of ""self checkout"" is *""self""*. So the line grew longer and longer, as there were only four machines, and this woman was taking up one of them. The woman I was shadowing kept an eye on this, but had to monitor everything else, too, so I was on my own, fighting a losing battle against stupidity. 

Finally, I just ask her where she saw these prices. Did she give me a clear answer? Of course not. She just points to the general section of cushions, right next to the self checkout. 

&gt;""Alright m'am, but what shelf did you get it from?""

What followed was a minute long description of the general area she found the cushions, and at the end of it, I still had no idea what she was describing. Still, I headed over to the cushion shelves, looking at everything on the shelves. I took pictures of all the tags, and came back, showing her the tags and comparing them to the product names on the tags.

&gt;""There are a lot of similar products with vastly different prices. They're easy to mix up. I'm sorry for the confusion."" 

I phrased it the best I could to give her an easy out. I basically did my best to open a large, metaphorical door labeled ""EXIT"". And what did she do with this verbal, get out of jail free card? 

She took it, accepted the apology, and went to reconsider her purchases.

...

Obviously I'm kidding. 

She insisted that I was wrong, the pictures of the tags were wrong, the machine was wrong, the woman I was shadowing who backed me up was wrong, and the $25-ish cushion was in fact, eight dollars. 

At this point, I had her take me to the shelves, along with a few of the cushions that she insisted were $8. I took her cushions, looked at the tags, matched the names to the correct tags, and carefully explained how they were different prices, with a few apologies for the confusion thrown in for good measure. 

At this point, the woman picked up a different cushion, which was eight dollars. On top of being a different pattern, it was thinner, and it was overall a lower quality product. I explained these differences, and she continued to insist that they were the same, except for the pattern. 

Somehow, she managed to cut into the conversation every few other line about the pillows. The pillows were another matter, because the racks hosting them were pretty picked over, and it would take a while to match it. I explained that we would look at them once we figured out the cushions, but she just bounced between the two like a mid-match tennis ball.

At this point it had maybe been fifteen minutes at least, and I still couldn't convince her they were different. She returned to the self checkout register she'd parked her cart in front of, because of course she wasn't moving or cancelling the transaction, which was now only one item thanks to the request to void anything she scanned after she'd scanned them. Thankfully, the woman who I was shadowing stepped in to reinforce what I was saying, at which time the woman switched to arguing with her instead.

After maybe a minute or two of this, a store associate was finally called, her transaction was cancelled, and she moved her cart to the side, where she promptly began to argue with him instead. They were there for at least another five minutes before I went to help somebody more reasonable, and when I looked back a while later, they were both gone. From what I've heard, she just sort of gave up and didn't buy anything. Oh well.

**TL;DR: A woman was seemingly incapable of understanding the difference between two clearly labeled items, not matter how it's explained.**",TalesFromRetail,1166,1530603422
GoabNZ,Can I have another customer's item?,"So I work in a bakery, in a supermarket, and amongst your regular baguettes and sliced loafs and rolls and stuff, we have your more ""upmarket"" breads including pane ciabatta, pane di casa and sourdough etc.

One of these breads is really popular (though to be honest I can't see the fuss about it but if the customer wants it then they want it), and so sometimes we run out. It can be hard to predict sales because there are a few people who when they do come in, they'll buy several of them and freeze some I guess. But if they don't come in, we might not sell them all. Because the name might identify me, it shall remain nameless. 

So cue busy Saturday morning. We get a phone call asking to hold a couple of loaves aside, sliced, to be picked up at noon. We comply, and store them in bread crates. Well, so busy that we quickly sell them all and the bakers start to prepare some more.  

We get your usual requests for them, and we apologise, explain the situation and most people understand. Not this one lady however. 

Lady: ""Have you got any of that bread?""

Me: ""No sorry, it's sold out and the next batch will be some some time away.""

*Lady looks past me and sees the order.*

Lady: ""I see some there, can I have that?""

Me: ""Sorry, a customer has ordered that and will be here soon to pick it up.""

Lady: ""Well I'm here now so you can give me and they can have the next batch.""

Me: ""No, I'm sorry but the next batch will be too late and we've already promised them that bread at that time.""

Lady mentions something about first in first served, and I'm just like, they had the foresight to understand that and order some ahead of time. If you'd done that then we'd do the same for you. But either way, one person is leaving empty handed. Priority goes to the person who ordered because we've promised them, we haven't promised you. 

So I eventually manage to convince her and get back to my work. Or so I thought. I find out she straight away went to another worker to ask the same question - can I have anther customer's item. Again she was denied but she acted like a child asking dad because mum said no. 

Not only did the customer who ordered them come only minutes after, I'm told we keep it further in the bakery than we used to because some customers in the past have literally walked in, ignoring all signs, without hair nets, and grabbed what they see in crates to buy. Ignoring the fact that they sometimes are old, unsafe, or recalled products waiting to be processed. So we changed the layout to make it harder to see, and harder to barge in and take without being caught. She might've tried this because apparently its happened before. 

Anyway, she huffed away in a ""never coming back"" attitude. ",TalesFromRetail,1736,1530559752
Biggaymistake,Customers will literally wiggle their way past barriers and cages in order to get a sandwich that we can't legally sell.,"So I was working the Deli today with one of my coworkers; it's a Monday so it's not that busy besides the couple of people that stop by for one slice of ham for lunch.


One of the manages from the chiller department asks if she can borrow me, and takes me over to the aisle where we keep our sandwiches, desserts, salads, and general meal deal sort of things. There's a couple of other coworkers, one who looks very upset, and the manager hands me her PDA and tells me that I need to count out every single item of a product, scan it and put the number of items in the system in, then dump it all into a cage full of food. I asked her why and she told me the fridge is broken, so the temperature has risen over the legal limit and the food can't legally be sold due to health and safety risks.


It was nice to get out of the deli, but man it sucked throwing away all the food in the chiller, especially considering they were fully stocked up so I was throwing away around 16 of one item at a time.


While I was working, a few other coworkers moved constructions barriers and those large metal cages for milk to block off the entire area so that people couldn't come into the area easily. But that didn't stop people.


It was basically two of my coworkers job to tell people they can't by the food that 4 of us are frantically tossing into giant bin bags, but people would just wiggle their way past the cages/barriers and stare at the sandwiches/salads/etc that haven't been binned yet and would be confused when told they couldn't buy them.


It was just so bizarre that people blatantly ignored all the barriers and signs that said ""Hey the fridge is broken so these products can't be sold!"" on every shelf, like how can you not see us tossing food away and think ""Mmm, I'm gonna buy me some of that"".


The real kicker was a lady who clearly was trying to buy a meal deal was told she couldn't by anything from the fridge, and her instant response was ""Is the chocolate okay??"" like....yes, it's on a shelf and doesn't need to be in a fridge, like what?


Anyways, it was just depressing to throw away almost three cages worth of food, but it was bizarre watching people completely ignore their surrounds and not think about whats happening around them.


TLDR; sandwich fridge breaks and all food needs to be thrown away, but some customers don't understand what that means because they want their damn chicken sandwich!!",TalesFromRetail,1437,1530549315

I used to work in a bakery inside of a bookstore and one day a lady came in with her young kids. What followed was your typical mom walking around on the phone not paying attention to her kids running amuck and making a ruckus. After about 20-30 minutes of this she wrangles her kids up to the bakery counter, still on her phone. She stopped talking just long enough to tell me what she wanted and then went straight back to her conversation while I prepared her order. I spotted something out of the corner of my eye while I was working and glanced up to see that her kids had climbed on a bench next to the counter and had grabbed some packages of our large Gourmet cookies which are not cheap. And here's where I become the bad guy because just ignored them. A couple minutes later I hear the mom gasp and look up to see her realizing that her kids have open the packages and started eating the cookies. She ended up paying an extra 10-15 bucks for them and I didn't feel one bit of guilt.

RachAgainstLeMachine,The Sunglasses Giver™️,"This one is short and simple, but I smile just thinking about it so I wanted to share.

I work at a sportswear/clothing store and I usually work as a sales associate on the floor. 

We were in the middle of a busy rush, so I got called up to the register. No big deal, happens a lot.

I ring a few people out before I get to The Sunglasses Giver™️ (SG).

SG was one of those 55ish year old women who had bleach blond hair, pink nails, and cheetah print, but still managed to look classy. 

Anyway. 

She comes up to my register and she is only purchasing a single pair of sunglasses.

SG: it’s summer time! That means it’s time for a new pair of glasses! 

Me: yeah I totally understand I have to get some new ones myself.  The ones you have now are cute!

SG: Yeah,  I like them, but they’re too small for my face.

*I ring up SG and begin to put her new glasses in a bag*

SG: No need!

*I hand her the glasses and she replaces the old ones on her head with the new ones*

SG: there we go! Want a pair of sunglasses?

Me (confused): what

SG *holding out her old glasses*: Want a pair of sunglasses

Thexthy,She's having a seizure? Can you still ring me up?,"Not much back story. As you can probably guess from the title, I'm epileptic and have seizures. Thankfully, my store was actually super understanding of my disability and did everything to help me. This is a mixture of what I remember, and what I was told by my managers what happened.  

There is only 1 register in the store where you can get cigarettes/lighters/certain more expensive liquor etc. And I happened to be the one working that register. Everything was going completely fine with the usual customer banter when an aura hit me and hit me hard.  

For those of you that are unfamiliar, an aura is kind of a warning sign before a seizure that only you can feel, but can do nothing about. It could be a funny smell, hallucinations, the feeling of slipping out of reality, a number of different things. Anyway, for me, this time, it was the feeling that everything was moving in slow motion.  

Last thing I remember was scanning a box of golf balls and the customer requesting Marlboro gold, Then feeling frozen in place (which apparently I actually was) I heard this right before I blacked out. 

Guy: Hello?  HELLO!?! HEEEEEELLLOOOOOO!?!  WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? I SAID I WANTED A BOX OF MARLBORO GOLD! ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME??  I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS! MARLBORO GOLD! DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS?? ARE YOU AN IDIOT?  

Aaaaaand then I was gone. I woke up on the floor surrounded by my managers. (One customer was awesome enough to go run and get help.) From what I understand, the whole time I was on the floor having a seizure, the customers in line were watching this and *actually bitching* to the managers helping me about how I must be on drugs and they still expected to be rung up, despite them trying to explain I was having a seizure.  
They were telling the managers to ""just step over me"" to get their smokes and lighters for them and get to the register, then causing a huge scene when they were refused. They said they actually had to radio security to come and shoo people away.  

It just blows my mind that people can act this way. Look, I'm sorry I'm having a seizure and can't get your cigarettes for you, but I don't exactly have any control over this. I think you'll survive without your smokes and lighters for a few more minutes. Makes me sad this is the world we live in sometimes.",TalesFromRetail,6280,1530224817
EliBloodthirst,You came back,"Hey guys I'm back for another story about my self checkouts and the wonderful things that happen, this story commenced on the day of the champions league final back in may.

It was relatively misplaced considering the day, people were mainly in for lunch and booze for the final. The time of day was about 11am and I only had a couple of customers present.

M will be m, l will be old lady

M; hello maddam how are you doing today

L: good thank you, just getting food for me and my son tonight

M: ooh it's the champions leafue final today, I'm glad I'm not missing that.

The ladys ears peaked at this

L: that's what tonight is for, me and my son are Liverpool's fans and wish for them to win. Going to watch  the game with some grub

M: haha say no more, goodluck for tonight I'll be routing for the English!

At this point she had finished packing and walked off and i resumed to serve the few people in my area. About two minutes later and i turned around and she had never finished paying. My bad really I should have been concentrating but it happens.

 I logged it immediately, reported to security and a higher up abd usually that's the end of it but I had just this feeling she'd come back. 


Well an hour surpassed and who's face did i see trying to buy some beer? The old lady i had served earlier who walked off, now I've knly had this happen to me once before and i was outstanded.

M: You actually didn't maddam, I'm sorry but I distracted you from finishing your transaction and you walked off. My fault really.

L: It's okay I'll just pay for the transaction and add these beers.

We chatted some more about the football and she paid this time for her stuff. It's great when you have people pure enough to want to come back and pay for the stuff when you accidentally walk off because it happens but too many people don't come back.

TheSilverNoble,"""But you represent your company! You have to tell me!""","Direct quote from an angry customer, when I wouldn't tell her my full name. I don't tend to tell angry people my whole name. 
 
It starts when I get a call from her. She is angry, because she is missing some items from her order, and she needs them in two days.
 
I check our records and see that she did not order the missing items. Rush shipping for the to arrive in time is more than the price of the things themselves. I'm willing to cut her a break, but we can't cover the whole thing for her mistake.
 
And that's when things go bad. She 100% refuses to accept responsibility. She wants us to overnight the order, and comp the items themselves for her trouble. I tell her no, and stand firm, which I guess she wasn't used to.  
 
""So you won't send them to me? Even though I need them tomorrow?""
 
""I'm sorry, but it your responsibility to review your order before checkout."" She didn't like that, but I read tired of her blaming us for her mistake.

One time we had a lady come in with a junker. I thought the damn thing would fall apart in the shop. So, the driver door was fighting us and we had to climb in through its open window to get into the damn car. We did not attempt to force the door open in any way.

After shopping the lady comes back to me to check out and pick up her car. She bought about 200 dollars worth of items. So it took a million years on top of all of the car paperwork.

About 5 minutes after she left, she walked back in through the door and demanded a manager. I asked what as wrong, and she walked me out to her car. There was a HOLE in the lock of her door. She claimed that we had used a screwdriver to pry open her door!

So I called my manager on his cell, and he walked out there and was as 'suprised' as I was. We checked the security footage, and the LADY PULLS OUT A FUCKING SCREWDRIVER AND JAMMED IT INTO HER OWN FUCKING LOCK.

Tritefull,"Finally, I get what I wanted.","Long story short: lately, I've been working both the register and seafood varying upon the day/hour. I love working seafood, because I grew up in a fishing family. I'm only a student and they understand that.

On the front end, as I've bitched before, they're a different breed entirely. Our Front End Manager has her society of disciples, the *quorum* we shall call them, which includes people hired both before and after me. These are the kind of dear soul who jumps when the manager says jump, and sucks her head right up the arse for whatever they can get. I'm not like that. I do not suck up, but am always kind and willing to take a shift if someone is sick or whatever. Lately, several ""higher ups"" in the front end changed departments, due to this manager. In fact, one dear lady who has been working there for twenty-years (retired from teaching), had me come into the office with her as a third party while she told the manager right off about picking favourites and having only a select number of people do any leisurely working activity - always the same people cleaning tills, greeting customers, giving out samples, regardless as to whether they're trained or not. This lady saw it happening not just to myself and her, but to all the other good employees who refused to just suck up and be a favourite. 

For the front end, a collection of 75 cashiers in total, calling in sick is a mortal sin. Lately, my wisdom teeth have decided to come in and I've been living off my five-year-old nephew's pureed leek and potato because I can't open my jaw wide enough for anything else. Last Friday, I discovered that three people that were hired on six months ago - members of the quorum - were selected to become supervisors, and I, completing my Masters, was not chosen - I who has worked there for six years. My supervisor that night came over to visit, saw the swelling in my face and the basically flooding of tears in my eyes from the pain. She told me to go home, and I said I think I can do it, but she bluntly replied ""I'm a mother. I can smell pain from a mile away. Go home, and don't worry about coming in tomorrow. Put ice on your face all day and rest.""

Bring on Saturday. Me, in bed, ice to cheek, presuming I had the day off due to my kind supervisor's effort to prevent me from banging my head off a concrete block. My phone buzzes on my bed but I ignore it. My cheek was literally killing me slowly. Then the house phone rings, which I ignore, because I still am dying. 

Bring Sunday. After dinner, (lunch for Americans), I stopped in to work a shift in the seafood to train in a new young lad they hired. Up comes front end manager, (F.E.M. from here on) with her sidekick, (S.K. from here on) and a piece of paper. 

F.E.M.: Where were you yesterday. How come you're down here when we very clearly had you scheduled up at the front yesterday, and you never showed?

Me: Well, I went home Friday because of my wisdom tooth. I had it rested all day Saturday, and plus (Supervisor's name) said she'd write a note saying I wouldn't be able to make it in. Believe me, I'm still in pain.

S.K.: You can be fired for this, you know, not showing up for a shift without calling in. 

Me: But (supervisor) told me she'd leave a note.

F.E.M.: Yes, and I have it here. It says ""(Me) was in a lot of pain last night, told him to go home and get some rest, and he will not be in tomorrow. Thanks, S.K."" You know it's not up to you when you can come and go?

S.K.: You're allowed to call a supervisor and tell her or him that you're sick, but you cannot just NOT show up.

Me: But did you read the note.

F.E.M.: Still unacceptably. It's not up to the supervisor who can work and not. I did up that schedule. You left those girls (the two supervisors) in a real pickle. {At this point I'm cringing from the whole conversation}

Me (pissed right off): I know, and everything you're saying is true, however you're not the muppet spring on my legs and arms and hands. Nor are you the one who controls when a tooth decides to split in and ruin my comfort. I was sick, I was told to go home, and I was told to get rest to which I agreed. Clearly, if you had the capacity to process that letter in your hands then you would see that you were notified that I would not be here. Now, I can be reasonable if you want to be as well, but of course if you come down here, both of you, so stubbornly confused as to what a letter, written in English says, then you will not get the happiest response from me. I will be kind, but I will not give into this foolishness.

F.E.M.: We have no choice but to write you up. 

Tick tock past ten minutes of useless conversation, all of a sudden the bakery manager comes up to me. She will be B.M.

B.M.: I heard all that. She got no bloody right to do that. Want to work over in the bakery from now on? I need a baker. You can start tomorrow, and you can be sure you'll be in my department by the time she gets a change to write up all that so she won't be able to submit it. 

Me: YES YES YES (in more words but like I was excited)

B.M.: Alright well we'll coordinate your bakery and seafood together so you're not worn out, and f\*\*\* the bitch out in the front. 

Summary: I didn't realise I was the only one who disliked the F.E.M. I also didn't realise the bakery manager was such a sweet heart,

gypsymamma,"""You scratched up my car and you're gonna pay!""","I hope it's okay to relay this story from my husband. He works in the service department of a large busy dealership. He likes his customers and has quite a few that are really nice folks. But every so often he gets a real jerk.

This lady was a first time customer. He worked with her on the estimate and got the work completed and all was going well. She came to pick up her vehicle, paid and left, only to return minutes later pissed and yelling. Accused him and his techs of scratching her car and threatening that she'd see him pay.

My husband kept his cool and said, let's go look at your car and you can show me the damage. They walk out together and the lady leads him to her car, angrily going on about how careless my husband and his team are.  They get to the car and my husband takes a look at it and tells her, ""Ma'am this is not your car.""  She dumbfoundedly looks at it and then pushes her key fob, and sure enough, her car beeps from a different place in the parking lot.

I asked him, did she at least apologize? I mean, I'd be mortified if it was me! He said no, she never even said sorry, just went off and got in her car and drove away.",TalesFromRetail,1962,1529939881

alwayswatchyoursix,You won't give me the price I want? I want you to delete all my receipts except for when I need them.,"So, title is basically the punchline here.  I mean, that's how things work here, right?  Anyways, this is my first time posting here, so I'm definitely open to constructive criticism on better posts.  I have a lot of stories.  I just need to get around to posting them.  For this one, I won't be posting specific dialogue, as I still remember the way the conversation went, but not word for word.


**Background**

I used to work for a large national chain that was in the powersports industry.  We sold mostly motorcycle apparel and accessories.  No servicing of vehicles, but if a customer brought in a wheel, we'd replace the tire or tube on it.  Our return policy was pretty open-ended, so receipts were saved for a rather long time, and usually searchable by customer name.

I've since moved on to other things, so this story takes place a few years ago.

---

Repeat problem customer came in one day with her husband.  At this point, everyone knew to avoid her, because no one likes being yelled at or feeling like they are wasting their time.  Unfortunately, that meant that it fell to me to help her out, as I was the MOD at the time.  Can't just NOT help a customer.  She was looking for a new riding jacket, so off we go to see what we can find for her.

After over an hour of helping her try on all sorts of different riding gear, during which she didn't like anything because of a variety of reasons, was extremely rude to me and her husband, and basically implied that it was a corporate conspiracy that nothing was good enough for her, she finally decides she wants to buy a particular set of riding gloves instead.

We have them in stock.  They fit her.  She wants them.  She heads towards the registers.  Success!  The nightmare is over!

Yeah, no.  Not even 2 minutes later, I'm getting called to come up to the registers.

I get there to have my customer yell at me that the cashier ringing her out is ruining her life.  Not exactly those words, but phrases I still recall include ""she's an idiot"", ""she thinks she's better than me"", and ""I won't stand for being discriminated against like this"" (honestly, no idea where that last one came from).  She's yelling all this at me, and she's being loud about it, so the entire store can hear her ranting.  I get to work trying to figure out what's going on, and how to fix it.

Turns out that she's flipping out about the price of the gloves.  Now, they aren't cheap gloves, but the price is very prominently displayed on the packaging, so no bait-and-switch going on here.  But she has found someone on Craigslist selling a used, older version of the same gloves for less than half of what we are charging for a new set.  My cashier told her we don't price-match Craigslist, which is what caused the blow-up.

I tried to explain it to her.  I really tried.  New vs. used.  Older model.  Don't even look the same, just the same name.  Analogies.  Nope, she's not having it.  She wants a new 2018 Toyota Camry for 1999 Camry with sagging interior pricing.

We are now at an impasse.

At this point, she decides to announce she's never going to shop her again.  She announces that she's going to return everything she's ever bought from us.  And she also decides that she wants us to delete her name out of the entire system, RIGHT NOW.  I explain to her that we look up customer history by name, and we won't be able to look up receipts for her returns if we do that.

She starts yelling ""I know my rights.  I have a right to privacy.  I want it done right now!  RIGHT NOW!  RIGHT NOW!""

So that's exactly what we did.  I walked the cashier through opening up the customer's record, and deleting all of her info (name, phone number, etc.) from it.  She threw the gloves on the counter and walked out.

She came back in two days later, when I was off, to make a return.  She was was completely shot down by the MOD that day.  No receipt, no record of the customer.  The MOD for that day told me that when she told the customer that there was no record of her ever having shopped there because she had asked for it to be deleted, the look on her face was priceless.

juni0rbastard,"“I’m Canadian, I know that”","I work at a dollar store in a western city in Canada. For those who don’t know, we no longer use 1 cent coins. We haven’t for maybe two years (I could be wrong. Probably longer). 

Our registers at work still use pennies, but since they’re no longer in circulation, we have to round up or down. 

I sold a lady a drink container, and her total was $1.31. Automatically I round down. She gave me $1.35, so I returned 5 cents to her.  

FIVE MINUTES LATER SHE COMES BACK WITH HER RECEIPT.  She’ll be CO, I’ll be ME. 

CO: You gave me too much change. 

ME: I didn’t. Since we don’t use pennies anymore, your change was 5 cents. We have to round up or down. 

CO: I know that I’m Canadian. It says here 4 cents but you gave me too much. 

ME: ma’am, your total was 1.31 which gets rounded down to 1.30, you gave me 1.35 so I give you back 5 cents. 

CO: NO! You’re supposed to give me 4 cents. 

I shrug my shoulders as she turns and looks at the 5 customers I have in line. She turned around and stormed out.

YellowHammerDown,"Sir, we don't sell doorframes with no doors inside them.","Last night I had a guy I thought was a methhead come into the store at the lumber registers asking to return a door. I was covering my friend's lunch break. It was late.
I paid no attention to the door at first, but this dude looked sketchy and I'd seen him in the store several times doing sketchy stuff before (he was skinny, scruffy, and wrinkled up. He looked the part of most drug addicts that come into the store). But it was 8 at night so I was the only guy down in the lumber yard. I am qualified to do returns, so I start asking him the basic questions.

""Do you have the receipt?""

""No.""

""Do you have the method of payment with you?""

""No.""

At this point I'm sure this dude is up to no good, and there's no way I'm going to return this down here, where I'm alone. I send him up to customer service. Shortly afterwards, my friend gets back so I'm headed back up to customer service. This guy stops me and he's asking me where the doors department is. I tell him. He heads over there and I make it back up to customer service.

Sitting on a cart right there is this door, and I finally get to inspect it.
They're wasn't even an actual door. The barcode had been ripped off and there was just a wooden doorframe, and definitely not in returnable condition. The white painted frame had scratches and what looked like crayon markings all over the sides.
While the perp is back checking out doors I flag down one of the assistant managers on duty. He takes a look at the doorframe and says, ""we're not taking this back.""

The man was rather pissy and rude when he got back up to the service desk, but my friend, who works in paint and home decor and followed him all the way back to where the doors are to find one, is there for backup.

""You guys could've just told me you wouldn't return it instead of wasting my time,"" he grumbles.

""Sir,"" butts in my friend, ""you wasted your own time bringing this in and dragging me out of my department all the way back to find a match for this doorless doorframe that we don't sell. So why don't you get on your little bicycle and get out of here?""

957pm,This is not going to end how you think it will.,"First time posting, I've run across some idiots but nothing that seemed worthy to post until last night.

Setting: Working OT all week because we're understaffed and it's ten minutes AFTER closing. For once people are actually making an effort to hustle to the front of the store, but the line for the only lane open (moi's) is long and the natives are growing restless. Trying to get through this as fast as possible. 

Cast:  
Me = Me  
TD = Tattooed Dude

MAM takes her sweet time loading her stuff onto the belt, and has decided we're going to be best friends. She talks about the weather, her son's upcoming birthday, asks my opinion on the fruit she bought (really) completely oblivious to the huge ass line behind her. 

I try to humor her as much as possible while scanning her stuff. I'm on a roll, and actually pull the last item from her hand as she's setting it on the belt. 

MAM: Well you're in a hurry!  
Me: Sorry, ma'am  

MAM pays and steps to the side to start bagging her groceries and TD steps up.

TD: THAT was a wait.  
Me: Yeah, sorry about that. Cash or credit -   
TD: I'm wondering if you guys have a manager.  
Me: Uh, yes?  
TD: Well?

TD only had a few things and at this point I'm waiting for him to pay. The people behind him have all loaded their stuff up onto the belt.

TD: Are you gonna call him up here?  
Me: Sorry, it's actually after closing and -
TD: Is he gonna be here tomorrow?? I want to tell him about how slow service is while the ONLY CASHIER spends his time talking to his MOM.

Knever,"""This says 30% off, so it's 30% off, right?"" ""Actually, it's 50%-"" ""No 'actually!' It says 30% off so it's 30% off!"" ""...""","Another tale from the game store. We've had a Clearance Sale for quite a while now with clearance collectible items (plushies, action figures, small toys, etc.) at 30% off, with signs posted as such. My boss made a small sign for a particular item, a big NERF gun, highlighting the deal. It's normally $100, the sign said, ""$70 after discount!""

This happened on the day the sale changed to 50% off. I didn't get around to changing the signs, but I let people know if they appeared interested in the clearance items.

In comes a woman with her child. She walks around the store for a bit and notices the NERF gun. It piques her interest. I'm helping another customer as I see her study the sign my boss made (which is inaccurate at this point). I finish with my customer and go up to her, and before I can get a word out she says, ""This is 30% off, right? This sign says so.""
I should have chosen my words better when I responded to her (but that still doesn't excuse her from lashing out).

""Oh, actually, it's not *30*% off, it's-""

She cuts me off. ""What do you mean?! It says right here! $70! You have to honor that!""

It's really annoying when people misuse ""honor"" when it comes to retail, but it didn't really matter, as I still hadn't properly explained the change in the deal.

""I'm sorry ma'am, let me explain-""

""No, there's no explanation needed. The sign says it's 30% off so you have to sell it to me for 30% off.""

Now, I know what most of you are thinking. I should just placate her and ring it up, and manually increase the price in the computer by $20. But I didn't think she deserved that. Rather, she did deserve it, but I wasn't going to be the one to cheat her out of twenty bucks.

""Ma'am, I'm trying to explain something, can you please let me explain?""

""Fine, but I still want it for 30% off.""

""Okay. So the 30% off deal changed to-""

""But it says right here!""

""MA'AM. Please. Let me finish.""

She crosses her arms and stays silent, like whatever I'm going to say isn't going to change anything.

""The deal is now 50% off instead of 30% off. So it costs less than what is listed.""
The look on her face was one of supreme embarrassment. She still ended up buying it, but was so embarrassed that she didn't say anything else. Didn't even respond when I asked if she had a rewards cards (which she did, since I was the one who actually set her up).

I wish people weren't so impatient.",TalesFromRetail,4599,1529425453
UnoriginalBlonde,"Intoxicated customer refused service, crashes into automatic door after trying to persuade us she was sober?!","My first time posting and I’m on mobile so I apologise in advance for any grammatical or spelling mistakes. This is a long one and I may not be the best storyteller but god loves a trier.

So for a bit of background to set the scene, I work at a large UK supermarket that’s smack bang in the middle of a council estate and a very affluent area so we get a wide variety of customers.

I was working last night (Monday evening) on the customer service desk (situated at the front of our store) when a lady came flying in on a mobility scooter and parked up next to my desk. She wobbly clambered off and went outside to get a trolly (I would just like to clarify here that she was in fact not disabled, just heavily intoxicated and using her mother’s scooter). My suspicions were raised further when I noticed a water bottle containing a yellow substance, clearly not water, in the front basket of her mobility scooter. She came back in with her trolley and swayed off towards the alcohol section at the back of the store. 

I mentioned to my colleague working on the kiosk that she probably shouldn’t be served due to her intoxicated behaviour, we discussed this further and decided it would be best not to serve her. I also informed the supervisor on duty so he could warn other colleagues on the checkouts in a different area of the store. Our store policy, as I’m sure is the same as many other stores, is that if we sell alcohol to someone who’s intoxicated and they then get into an accident and are hurt, whoever sold the alcohol is liable. 

A short while later, she came back towards the kiosk area with an 18 pack of Strongbow (cider) and asked for a pack of cigarettes. She left the strongbow in her trolley and started counting out the money to pay for her cigarettes. I politely asked her if she wanted the strongbow as well as a well known method of stealing in our store is buying something from the kiosk in the hopes that the colleague on there wouldn’t see it or assume it had been bought elsewhere in the store. 

She begrudgingly put the Strongbow on the counter and my colleague told her that she would be unable to serve her the alcohol. The intoxicated customer was less than impressed and started kicking up a fuss trying to persuade us she wasn’t intoxicated (all the while slurring her words and swaying about). She then stood for 5 minutes deliberating if she even wanted the cigarettes as she wasn’t getting the Strongbow. 

My colleague kindly explained our store policy and that we were just looking out for her. So she paid for the cigarettes and we breathed a sigh of relief. She ditched her now empty trolley and came back to get her mobility scooter. She took way too long trying to get the key into the machine as she clearly couldn’t see straight and we thought we had got out of the situation unscathed. 

Boy were we wrong. Now our supermarket has two sets of automatic doors that open when they sense something in front of them (rocket science I know). She zoomed off on her mobility scooter just making it through the first set of doors when we both commented that she’d thankfully missed them only to hear an almighty crash a second later. We assumed she was hurt so as I walked round to see if she was okay when I hear her yell ‘Oops, didn’t mean to do that’ and speed away. 

She had driven into the door as it hadn’t sensed her due to the speed she was travelling at and smashed the pane of glass. She didn’t stop, didn’t say sorry, nothing. People like that make me hate the world just that little bit more.

She won’t be charged for it and I’m sure as eggs are eggs that she’ll be in again soon trying to steal more Strongbow. I love retail. ",TalesFromRetail,664,1529398698

MHC: * Something about humans being indecent *

Me: Yup * Typing up the item he's looking for and trying to figure out how to spell reusable cause that's me for you*

Turns out we didn't have the item, but after I finished helping him he opened up the bag for me so I could but the sticks back in and he tried helping me up, but I got up myself cause I'm an independent woman who needs no man! Nah, I'm kidding, sheesh, take a joke. 

Anyway, I told him he was the first customer to do something so nice.  I wanted to post this on here cause I read too many rude customer stories on here and there are good ones out there, too.

SDhandler,Is it 10 inches though!?!?!?,"I work for a retailer that sales lots of pet stuff and yesterday I had this lady come up to my till with some food and two boxes of trimmers. Now a word on the trimmer she was interested in. It’s tiny, barely 5 inches in length, it’s used on paw pads. No where on this trimmer can you get even 10” worth of plastic, plus the trimmer is easily seen despite it being in a box.

I’ll be ME and the customer will be PC the pissed off customer.

PC: I need you to tell me if this is 10”.
Me: okay ma’am let me see

I look at the trimmer, double check the box (at this point I was thinking maybe she was wondering if this one had a 10” gaurd or something but the ones it had only went up to 3/8”.

Me: ma’am this says it only goes up to 3/8. 
PC: I DONT CARE!!!!! I want to know if it is 10”!!!!!
Now I’m a little taken a back and irritated because she’s mad that I answered her question and the fact that she was so over the top.
Me: it’s not, the one you’re still holding is though (this trimmer had it in bold letters on the front and back)
PC: Nooooooo!!!!!! I don’t want this one it has a cord!!!!

I look at her, take a step back, cross my arms and breathe

Me: then we are at an impass I guess. This trimmer isn’t ten inches, what do you want me to tell you?
PC: fine I don’t want it then!
Me: do you want me to call someone to help you go find the one that’s right then?
PC: no!!! I want to know if that one is 10 INCHES!!
Me: I’ve already answered that

In the end she didn’t get any trimmers but when she “apologized” she said it was because she just wanted someone to tell her if it was ten inches. Pretty sure she just wanted me to say yes just to help her little ego from being flustered at being illogical/ignorant",TalesFromRetail,1519,1529250399
mir2008,When is it ok to call the cops on a customer?,"I have worked retail for years and never had to call the cops on a customer...

So I work at a Waxing studio and we close at 8 but take our last client at 7:30 and we were totally booked for the night. I got several calls that night asking for appointments but told everyone who called I was booked. So 7:45 rolls around and the front door is still unlocked as we are waiting for our last client to finish up and then we can leave. So this women walks in. Let’s call her CL for crazy lady 

 CL- I just called...” 
 ME- no ma’am we are actually closed, I’ve told every client who has called tonight that we are booked for the rest of the evening 
CL- WTF I just spent $14 on an Uber to get here (this lady is clearly on some type of drug)
ME- Sorry ma’am I promise you that we did not speak on the phone as we take our last client at 7:30 and we are booked tonight, there is even a sign on the door, I would have never have told you to come in. 
CL- Yeah you seem really sorry, bitch!

At this point I’m in literal shock, I work in a nice upscale suburb and have NEVER experienced anyone talk to me like this. Meanwhile she goes to call back the last number she called which she thought was mine and then she calls it and our phone doesn’t ring so she realizes she’s in the wrong place and she is the idiot.  

ME- Ma’am I’m gonna have to ask you to leave, we are closed and I don’t like the way you are speaking to me
CL- Sorry my boyfriend beats me

Ok another red flag, we have a panic button under the desk and if you push it the cops will come. I let her sit there for a couple of minutes to try and order another Uber or to finally get up and leave and she doesn’t

ME- I’m gonna ask you again to please leave or I’m calling the cops 
CL- GOOD then they will arrest you.

I then press the panic button as I realize she is also drinking beer out of a paper bag and she still will not leave

ME- Ma’am I just called the cops, PLEASE LEAVE MY BUSINESS NOW.
CL- Still is sitting there and ignoring me

FINALLY the esthetician and client come out just as the cops are pulling up and I’m still trying to get this lady to leave so the client doesn’t have to see her. 

CL- Starts to say to the waxer “oh good she can see me now.”
ME- I scream NO we are not serving her and the cops finally show up.

The lady starts berating me in front of the client saying I’m awful at customer service and a bitch and that I should never work with people again, luckily the cops gave her a trespassing warning and said she was wasted out of her mind and if she comes back she will get arrested. 

Did I do the right thing? Now a days you never know what people are capable of and the fact that she came into my business cursing at me for no reason and refusing to leave really pissed me off. ( I also work the front desk alone so it was a very uncomfortable situation.)

RavenRaxa,"""Ma'am...""","I was on register and it was busy. There are two registers in that store. My co worker had cashed a woman out but it was so busy I had my hands full with my own line of customers, so I didn't have a clear picture of how the transaction went down, but I remembered she sounded a little upset. But when she left, she accidentally left a crisp $20 bill on the counter. I finished up with my last customer in line shortly after. My coworker had left the front for some reason without noticing it. I saw it, and grabbed it in my fist quickly to run it out to her and hopefully catch her before she left. I caught her halfway through the lot. Angry customer is AC and I am me.

Me: ""Ma'am, I think-""
AC: ""I don't care what you have to say to me, I'm leaving.""

She said this matter of factly, even though this was my first interaction with her. I was struck by the absurdity of the situation and it, along with her rudeness made me pause mid sentence. 

My jaw dropped. I closed my mouth, blinked, stood up a little straighter, and a warm, happy expression came over my face. I had the joy of seeing confusion pass over this woman's face seeing me smile as I turned around and walked back inside.",TalesFromRetail,786,1529169546
nreppep,STOP ARGUING WITH ME!,"I’m on mobile blah blah blah. 

So I’m a shift manager and today we had a really big project of setting up a new display for a brand. This woman came up to me while I had a ton of product in my hand and asked me what brand of product X she should buy to replace what she had at home. I told her, verbally directed her where it was (I couldn’t leave where I was since I had a lot of stuff in my hands and no where to put it) and she walked away to go look. About 20 minutes later she comes up to check out with my coworker and she has some other brand entirely, in fact it’s the brand she’s trying to find a replacement for. My coworker scans it and tells her the total. 

Coworker will be CW, angry lady will be AL, and I’ll be Me. 

CW: That’ll be $140. 

AL: What? How? It’s suppose to be 20% off!

CW: Nreppep? I need you. She said this is suppose to be on sale. 

*So I walk over to the product shelf and there is a sign for 20% off, but it reads “20% off brand’s product Y when you buy brand’s product X”, and she is buying product X.* 

Me: Ah! Okay, ma’am, this actually says when you buy the product you have here, you get 20% off of their product over here. 

AL: What? That’s false advertising! It says 20% off so it should be 20% off. 

Me: Ma’am, it’s not false advertising because it’s not advertising your product as being on sale at all, but you get a discount on another product when you buy this one.

AL: How am I suppose to know? I’m just looking for the discounts! It said 20% off and I didn’t bring my glasses so I can’t even read the rest of it! That’s false advertising!

*Yeah, she actually said that.*

Me: I’m very sorry ma’am. Corporate tells us to put the signs out and we do, we don’t control what it says or where it’s placed. But it doesn’t say that this particular item is on sale.

AL: You have to admit it’s false advertising!

Me: It’s not. The sign says exactly what we are advertising. 

AL: I’m still going to get the product! But you have to admit it’s false advertising! 

Me: I don’t know what to tell you....

AL: Tell me you agree!

Me:....

AL: I’m buying it anyway!

AL: NREPPEP! Are you the manager?!

Me: Yes. 

AL: Well haven’t you ever heard of the customer is always right?!

Me: Yes, but I can’t give you a discount that’s not even advertised. 

AL: DON’T ARGUE WITH ME! It’s false advertising! It is! This is not how you treat customers!

Me: I’m sorry you feel that way but I simply read to you what the signage was advertised. 

AL: Well this just isn’t right! This is horrible service!

Me: I’m sorry, but you’re more than welcome to leave.

5kfiend,“Let customers use the bathroom!”,"Hi all. On mobile, obligatory apologies etc. 

I work at a high end women’s clothing store. We just moved our store location. The former location had a bathroom that was hidden away in a corner off the main floor, so if people asked to use it no problem. This new location has its bathroom off of our back room/ break room. Because of this, we were imagining we no longer had to let customers use it, since, you know, back room and break room and all. WRONG. We are instructed by corporate to let all customers use the bathroom because if they can’t, well they might leave to find one and not come back. Money lost is far more important than your employees being able to take a relaxing break, right? 

So I’ve been just waiting for this to backfire on them somehow. Someone will trip and fall over the stuff we keep back there; or some oblivious customer will try to get someone on break to help them, then write a bad review because the employee explained they were on break and wouldn’t help them. Well, those things haven’t happened yet, but something did. And it played out ever so much more deliciously (pun intended) than I could have imagined. 

If you sit at the break table, your back is to the bathroom door. You face a wall and cannot see any comings and goings in the back room. So I’m on lunch, eating away and I hear the bathroom door close. I imagine it’s a co worker. I’m eating chips, and in an attempt to finish the bag I had stuffed a rather too large handful into my mouth. (Don’t judge, I never claimed to be a lady) I realize I also need a napkin. Mouth open, full of chips about to fall out, I go to the supply closet, which is right next to the bathroom. 

The bathroom door opens and instead of the coworker I’m expecting, I’m face to face with a customer. 

I stop.

She stops. She stares at my chip face in horror. 

I, somehow forgetting that I have a literal mouthful, awkwardly try to say “oh, hello.”  Which of course comes out more like “mmm, hewwwwro,” spraying a few chip flakes on her in the process. She fled the back room, horrified, and by the time I finished my lunch and came out she had left. 

And THAT is the kind of thing that will happen if you force us to let customers use our bathroom.

Manmadeking,The worst robbery attempt I've been witness to,"A customer comes into my store and hands me a list of things his ""friends"" sent him to buy for them. His ""friends"" wanted 5 packs each of 6 different types of cigarettes. Immediately I guess he's thinking of just running off with the cigarettes so I take my time grabbing them, scanning them, and then put them on beside my register rather than the counter so he can't reach them. While I'm grabbing the things his ""friends"" want he removes his backpack, opens it, and it was that moment he realizes I'm not putting them on the counter in front of him. He asks what flavors of cigarillos we have and while I read them off (cameras showed this and I noticed it) he tries reaching over the register to grab the cigarettes but he couldn't reach them if his life depended on it. When I notice him reaching over the desk-wall-thing that separates customer from register he pretends he's counting to make sure I had grabbed enough. A minute later when someone else pulls up to the store he suddenly tells me that ""cigarettes cost too much here"" and that he'll ""go down the street because they're cheaper there"" (they aren't cheaper).


After he leaves all I'm stuck is the thought that while I'm not the sharpest cookie in the shed it's just plain insulting of him to think I'm dumb enough to leave $200 worth of cigarettes on the counter for him to shovel into his backpack and skedaddle with... and also, he was riding a child's purple-and-glitter bicycle while wearing a bright neon-green shirt with a company name/logo printed on it (looked like a construction company shirt) and a Chicago Bulls cap at 1AM.

Neither of them have an online account. But they have several business with us. I ask her if it's under there and she has no clue (of course because why would that be useful to know) and she just says that it's the one that has all of the account to on it (obviously, im not stupid) so que me searching through all of their businesses to find their online account.

 I find it and she has indeed been locked out. Easy fix though, as we just reset the password. Unfortunately this time it wants me to either email or text a temporary one to her, rather than set it to the last four of the ssn or tin. But, no big deal... for normal people.

JammyThing,I don't have the receipt with me but I have a photo of it.,"This is one that happened about a month ago and I still find baffling. I was the manager on shift for the day and had got called to one of the tills by a work colleague via headset. They explained that the customer wanted to return an item but there was a problem with the ""receipt"". I got down to the till and the conversation went like this:-

Me - Hey there, are you looking to get a refund?

Customer - I am. It's this charger, it's just not working.

Me - I'm sorry to hear that, do you have your receipt?

Customer - Yep. Here you go.

It was at this point the guy handed me a sheet of folded A4 paper. I opened the sheet and on it in the top left corner was a blurry, distorted photo of half of the receipt. 

I began wondering if he took the picture in case he ended up loosing the original or something.

The image looked as if he had put the receipt on a table and took a picture with....something. (The angle made it seem like the part of the receipt that was visible was stretched into the distance.) He then must have sent the image to his computer, copy and pasted it into a word document and then printed it.

I looked at this sheet of paper and then at the customer.

Me - ...I'm sorry sir but I can't accept this...

Customer - Why not? That's the receipt.

Me – No, it's not the receipt. 

Customer – Well, yeah! It's a photo of receipt I took a while ago. It has all the information on it still. Look!

I could see the store name and just make out the item and it's price on it. I then tried explaining to the man that this is not valid but he wasn't having it. After a minute or so I changed tactic. 

Me – When did you buy it sir?

Customer – Within the year so I should be able to still get my money back.

We have a return policy where you can bring the item back in within 12 months and get a refund, after that we have to put them through to customer services. 

Me – Well I can't tell that, that is true as there is no date shown on the image of the receipt. 

I point out to him that the image did not show the part where the date is. This he actually accepted. 

Customer – Ah, I see. That does make sense I suppose. 

Me – I'm sorry about that but I can give you a number for customer services who maybe able to help.

Customer – Well would I be able to get a refund in store if I come back with the real receipt?

Me - ...You actually have the receipt? 

Customer – Yeah I've got it at home on my desk. I'll come back tomorrow with both.

And off he went. He did indeed come back the next day with the item and the full receipt and I gave him a refund for the item no problem. ",TalesFromRetail,2589,1528717765

So he freaks out and tries to come behind the counter (our registers are on a counter like how you would see at a gas station) . He gets like 2 feet in before other manager comes over and starts punching him. He goes outside comes back in 5 minutes later and does the same thing.. other managed starts whipping him with this big wirey thing..like straight up whipping  him...at this point the owner is there too and he starts pushing the dude outside. Dude runs away. We think it's the end of it again, but call the cops anyway...

He comes back again. He's outside and has a gun, but the cops are already surrounding the place (clearly visible idk why he even attempted coming back). They have already seen the surveillance footage so were planning on going to his house (you can see his address on his ID when he came back). They hear he has a gun and arrest him for attempted robbery and assault and idk what else. 

Guys, dont bring a gun to a store because your dumb ass forgot your ID.

anotherknockoffcrow,"""What does the six stand for?""","Hello!  This is my first post on talesfromretail and also my first reddit post in general, so bear with me for what is hopefully an uplifting tidbit.  

I do a lot of cashiering, and while customers watch me ring they frequently ask about my tattoos, specifically several low-quality stick n pokes on my left arm that I did myself.  They are all very personal and I did them all very drunk with the exception of a tattoo of six tally marks.  

Today I was ringing out a middle aged couple when the man asked me what the six stood for.  I don't always tell customers what my tats mean because too often they think I'm looking for a rude opinion but this guy had been polite so far, so I said, &gt; ""I did it on my sixth day sober.  It helped me get to seven.""  

Immediately the guy lifted his left arm to show me a tattoo of roman numerals and said, &gt; ""This was for four years sober.""  

It really took me surprise as the coolest part of my day.  As yall can probably relate to I go into a lot of interactions with customers dreading what they're going to say to me so it's awesome to have a moment like this instead.",TalesFromRetail,5452,1528603847
Goldie__1738,I just need lotto and cigarettes!!,"I used to work for a convenience store/gas station chain many years ago; I started right out of high school and became a dedicated assistant manager for almost 8 years. Even though a decade has passed since I last worked a shift behind the counter, I still kinda miss the customer interactions and life/career experiences I gained from that place. If it matters, I made the switch into having two amazing health care related careers. The only difference now, is that instead of ""customer"" we refer to them as a ""patient"".

Accept my apologies for any formatting issues, rambling, grammar, etc. I generally dissuade myself from posting, but after reading a tale about the ice cream store robbery, it reminded me of something similar.

This gas station gal, at the time, was working second shift with minimal staffing. We had 20 gas pumps and our weekly sales were approximately, on average, $60,000/week. To set the stage, it was peak season in our area AND it was the after work rush hour.

Pre-occupied at the register trying to get the customers in and out as quickly as we could (I had ONE other cashier with me), I suddenly hear this incredible BANG followed by glass shattering. It took me a second to comprehend the magnitude of what just occurred. Not only did this middle aged lady ""mistake the gas pedal for the brake"", causing her to crash into the store, she actually took down the cement barriers in front of the propane tanks, drove through that, and INTO THE STORE!!! Her car was sitting almost completely inside, stuck ON TOP of the cage full of NEW propane tanks. Thankfully, she didn't plow through our front doors and no one was in that area of the store when she busted through.

Immediately, I hit the emergency stop button on the pumps and multi tasked calling 911, paged my manager, assessed the damage to the store, got the lady out of the car, and began an evacuation process. At this point, I had no idea what was going to happen to the propane, considering the fact it has a car on top of it's crushed cage with a hot engine and hissing tanks.

You'd think that after hearing and seeing what just took place, people would get the hint. I had pissed off the customers pumping gas since I hit the emergency stop. I had to corral the customers in the store and herd them outside, making them drop their merchandise on my floor. Yet, I still had customers force their way in, saying ""I just need lotto and cigarettes, c'mon man, let me get inside"". All of this took place within minutes of the crash, finally I just yelled in frustration ""Do you see the car and propane tanks INSIDE OF THE STORE? I WANT TO GET THE F**K OUT OF HERE JUST IN CASE...GTFO""

Seriously folks, you'll live without lotto and cigarettes until you can drive to another store close by. People never cease to amaze me.

The perimeter around the store was closed off completely for about 3 hours. The woman inside the vehicle wasn't injured, nor did she have any medical issues causing her to crash. She said she genuinely mistook the gas for the brake and must've been ""booking it"" through the parking lot.

Wylie0312,Drunk Shoplifter,"This story happened a few years ago when I was working as loss prevention at a big box retailer. I watch this guy grab a bundle box, which at the time came with a laptop and a few accessories. He takes it away from the computer section and into an aisle where he proceeds to open the box and pull things out. After seeing this I alert the other employees and have someone go talk with him. As soon as an employee gets there he picks it up and heads towards the exit which is where I’m at now. When he gets to me I ask for a receipt and of course he doesnt have one. He is very drunk and has a thick foreign accent. He tells me this is his and he brought it in for repair because he ran over it with his car. I say wth and play along. I send him to tech support. He gets there,talks to the employee at that desk and puts the box on the counter. The employee takes out the laptop with a puzzled look and sees its perfectly fine and brand new. Tech support gives it back to him and again he tries to leave. I take the box out of his hands and asks if he has anything else that doesn’t belong to him. He lifts his shirt all the way up and then almost drops his pants to prove he has not taken anything else. I’m trying to hold in my laughter and everyone in the store is watching this guy with amazement. He pulls his shirt back down and his pants up and runs into the parking lot. I follow at a brisk walk as he is a short heavy set guy and doesn’t run fast at all. He makes it to an suv that is already running and before he opens the driver door turns around, sees me, and runs out of the parking lot and straight across a four lane, very busy, highway. Cars are slamming on their breaks and he somehow makes it across uninjured. Cops arrive later I tell them what happened and point them to the vehicle that is still running in the parking lot. They check the vehicle, they find the wife asleep in the passenger seat and two young kids below the age of ten in the back seats. The drunk guy eventually returns and is arrested. 


If you like this story I would be happy to post some of the other stories from my loss prevention days. ",TalesFromRetail,874,1528337261
TRFKTA,Idiot customer tries to steal. Meets karma.,"During the first part of my shift today I was chatting to one of our security guards who was telling me about a woman he caught trying to steal from the store I work at.

She had picked up a bag and proceeded to stuff a load of items into it, along with her mobile phone. Maybe to make it look more like her bag. Who knows.

Anyway, she was making for the exit when she clocked him coming for her and dumped the bag, with her phone in it, on the shop floor and made off.

The security guard put it in customer services where she’d have to come back for it. 

I was then telling one of my supervisors and co workers about it and we were having a laugh about it. Before I finished a woman interrupted me. ‘Is that my phone you’re talking about?’, she said. ‘I was meaning to pay for the bag but didn’t get a chance. 

We directed her to customer services and had a good laugh at her expense. She didn’t look like the smartest person I’ve ever seen.",TalesFromRetail,899,1528298981
Cultspook,Why do the worst customers get treated the best???,"Sorry for mobile formatting!

Background: I work at an optical shop in a pretty big ophthalmology practice. When a patient buys glasses through insurance, we generally have to send the frame to the lab for two weeks to get processed with some exceptions such as if they have no other glasses or if there has been a remake, we can rush the order and get it in a week.

We only hold frames for a week unless they tell us they will come in by a certain date. A patient put a frame on hold with no date and we put it back after a week. He comes in a month later, and is angry that we don’t have it anymore because we sold it. I tell him no problem, we can order the frame. 

After patient leaves, I’m informed the frame is on backorder for another month. I call the patient and tell him we have a few options. We can do a different size in the same color, the same size in a different color, wait for backorder and rush the lenses, or do the same size different color but still order the backordered frame and switch it over to the preferred frame when it comes in. He won’t even let me finish over the phone, interrupting me the whole way, telling me it’s ridiculous we have to send it out, it’s ridiculous the frame is on backorder, and I try to identify with him and apologize because it’s out of our control and I just want to help him and do whatever will make him happy. Come in and choose a different frame, whatever. Nothing will work for this guy. “I came in and looked at all your frames and this is the one I chose.” “I can go to LensCrafters and have the glasses done in an hour” and I’m just like “well, I understand, but I can only give you these options, I’m sorry.” He cancels the order and I’m somewhat relieved because I don’t like dealing with people like him.

My boss called today saying he wrote an email to her about how he’s been a patient with us for 20 years and somehow that makes him deserving of preferential treatment.

In my opinion, it doesn’t matter if you’ve been coming here your whole life or if this is your first time here, I’m going to help you as best I can no matter what.

So apparently now, my boss wants us to call him and offer him the different options that I already offered him. And I’m just like.... please, let him go somewhere else. I don’t want business from people like this, people that are rude and disrespectful do not deserve to be given special treatment. ",TalesFromRetail,1734,1528296342
FrozenGasoline,"""Why don't you accept US money?"" ""Cause this is Canada.""","So this happened a little while ago but just remembering it now. 

I work in a small grocery store chain that's only located in Canada. Our store is in a plaza and our cash desks are right in front of the windows, so I see this car drive up with a New York license plate and think ""Oh cool! Americans!"" It was an older dude who look maybe early forties. I greet him politely and he greets back. Explains to me how it his first time in this store and was told to check it out if he was ever up this way. No problem, I tell him how the store works, what to do and a bit of the types of products we have and let him go about his way. 

Now we used to accept US currency however with the exchange rate being different all the time and the fact that our POS is still stuck in the 90s (exchange would never be updated properly and spit out widely incorrect amounts) we decided to drop accepting it.

So buddy comes up and is ready to pay here's how this plays out. 

&gt; Me: Alright so that will come to $11.55!

Guy pulls outs out a US $20 bill.

&gt; Me: Sorry sir, we don't accept US cash...

&gt; Guy: Well, why not? 

Seems pretty defensive already.

&gt; Me: Because this is Canada.

&gt; Guy: Yeah I know *that!* But why don't you?

&gt; Me: It's our store policy, you could use a credit card if you want. 

&gt; Guy: No I don't wanna use that up here.

&gt; Me: Okay well there's a bank across the street that could exchange it for you. 

&gt; Guy: Why should I have to do that? You know (store name) and (other store name) accepted my money, why can't you guys?

&gt; Me: Well yeah some places do under their policy but most don't because this is Canada.

This was about a 5 to maybe 7 minute back and forth conversation with me explaining a bit more about why we don't and how he doesn't care about exchange and that we should just take it cause it worth more anyway. Yeah okay it is, but I still can't take it. 

&gt; Guy: Really? You guys should put up a sign in the window saying you don't, so people don't waste their time.

He then soon left, without his goods. But I still can't help but feel a dumbfounded by that interaction. A sign really? Why should we? I've visited The States many times and I always make sure that I'm carrying US cash. It's their nations currency it should be expected to use that over what ever else.
 
Also I don't know why he was adamant about not using his credit card. Can any American explain that to me if there is a good reason or is he just being stubborn? I've never attempted to use mine down there though didn't think it would be a big deal if I had to.",TalesFromRetail,1116,1528250239

Pocoparker,“You’re open now”,"(Sorry for formatting, on mobile)

Background: I work at a pretty large local supermarket chain on the front end. Normally we have 2 registers open from 8 to closing time but i was stuck on the only register when my coworker was sent to retrieve carts. 

I was told to work late and i was supposed to leave at 10:30 pm. 10:25 rolls around and my line fills up while my coworker is out getting carts. No problem, i’ll just leave at around 10:45. I finish getting these people checked out, my coworker comes in from getting carts and i shut off my register light and put the rope across my lane, indicating that i was closed and i start wiping down my register.

Ensuing dialogue will be Me and L (Lady).

L: I need to check out

Me: Okay ma’am my colleague has register 3 open so i’ll bring your cart over there because i’m closed for the night. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Lady now walks into my lane, unhooks the closed sign and starts scanning her items. 

L: You’re open now

Me: Ma’am, i’m sorry but i have to end your transaction as any tender  on my account after i’m supposed to leave can get me in trouble, regardless of the circumstances. 

L: Well that’s your problem, so finish scanning my items please and you can go once you’re done.

Me: Okay ma’am, but i’m just warning you that this is going to be a problem for the both of us.

My coworker (CW) now walks over and starts talking to the lady.

CW: I’m sorry ma’am but his lane is closed so i will bring you over to register 3 so you can be checked out and on your way. 

Me: It’s okay, i’m almost done scanning.

L: Thank you, at least you learned a lesson about customer service today.

Me: That’s right ma’am.
 
I finish scanning her items, tell her to have a good rest of her night and clock out. During my next shift i get called into the manager’s (M) office.

M: Did you check out anyone after you were supposed to clock out?

Me: Yeah, there was a late night rush and Coworker was out getting carts. Then a lady decided to open my lane for me and proceeded to scan her items for me.

M: Okay, we’ll look into the issue. Thanks for letting us know.

PoorCashier,"""Don't tell me you have only one register opened up?!""","Hello again, another story for you guys.


I work in a large grocery store and the last few days, we were two cashiers until 8 pm, and only one cashier from 8-10 pm, so we're kinda understaffed. Yet we still have to get the cleaning of 8 registers done, and usually the person who stays until 8 pm tries to get most of the cleaning done.

One evening, I was this cashier until 8 pm. 


I just did my job and cleaned the not-in-use registers and told my colleague to call me over to my register as soon as too many customers get in line, so I can open my register and help my colleague out. This works very well for us and we always do it like this.


So my colleague was at register number 7 and I was cleaning 1 and 2, which are at the other end of the register area. It was calm and my colleague had only one customer in line, so I was cleaning calmly. Then, a woman and her two kids walk up to me, seemingly wanting to get in line. I didn't even have the entrance open, the gate to the register was closed and had a bright red ""CLOSED"" sign on it. 


Me: ""I'm sorry, this register isn't open right now! Please get in line at register number 7.""

Lady: *already pissed* ""But you are here!""

Me: ""Yes, madam, I'm here because someone needs to clean up the registers.""

Lady: ""Don't tell me you only have one register open right now! I don't want to wait!"" 

Me: ""I'm sorry, madam. If you really are in a rush, I can open up another register for you, if you want me to.""

Lady: *rolls eyes* ""You don't need to!"" *walks away*


I mean, what the fuck? Did she expect to not having to wait at a GROCERY STORE? And even declining my offer and still being angry about having to wait, what the fuck is wrong with her? Some people just don't seem to have taken their brain with them when they left home.

Guy comes through with two boys that look underage. He's buying items, including beer. I'm a bit iffy on him, but he looks kinda old, like in his late 30's. I ask him his relationship with the two boys he's with, he says cousin and nephew. Meh, close enough for me.

I go ahead and ring up the beer, and it's fine until it comes time to pay. He asks one of the kids for money. I tell him since there's an exchange of money I need to see ID.

Haileyannn1234,maybe they should teach folding in high school...,"So I work in a retail store that sells clothes for all ages. We have these time periods where people who are given certain coupons during the shopping period are able to redeem them. We will call them store bucks for this purpose. These are typically dollar amounts off when you spend so much. and depending on how much you spend to earn them, that’s how much you have on your coupon.

So for this, mean lady will be ML and i’ll be me. 

Me: Did you have any store bucks you wanted to use today? 

ML: Yes. I have two.

Me: okay no problem! What are the coupons worth? 

ML. $30 each.

Me: Okay so we will have to split up transactions to use both and save you more money because we cannot combine coupons. But this isn’t a problem at all! 

ML: (with a completely straight face) no i only want to use one and NOT save money. 

Me: okay that’s fine too. no problem!

ML: that was a joke jeez. 

Me: Okay so you have hit your mark for the first transaction. can i have the coupon? 

ML: I just don’t know why you can’t do them in the same transaction. this is RIDICULOUS!

at this point she is already huffing at me and acting like i’m being ridiculous.

Me: Well our systems only allow for one coupon per transaction, so we cannot stack them. that is not on our store that is the higher ups decision. 

ML: (after i hand her the bag, with perfectly folded clothing) (she also had her daughter with her) can you help me refold these clothes? they are going to get wrinkled because she doesn’t know how to fold properly!

i ignored this comment because I knew that I had folded them perfectly before throwing them in the bag, as I do with every transaction. 

Me: okay now i’m ready for the second coupon!

(I made sure I took my time with the second bag to show her I was folding each item)

ML: Can you hand me the second bag already I need to refold every single item? they will get wrinkled!

Me: yes that’s fine no problem.

ML to her daughter: this is just ridiculous! they should teach folding classes in high school. apparently she doesn’t know how to fold properly. 

at this point you can just tell her daughter is so embarrassed by her moms behavior and is just giving her mom the worst look.

I don’t know if she was just mad about not being able to use two coupons in one transaction or if she really thought my folding was that bad even though i took the time to fold them. I have been working at this store for years, so I have had my fair share of “folding training”.

elsaar,A story that made my boyfriend cry when I told it to him later at home,"So this happened at work last Christmas.

I work in a family owned jewellers. The store literally had 4 employees at that point \- the owner, owner's son, another girl and me. This story happened between the owner and a little 10\-12 year old boy around Christmas. For context I'll just say that we were moving premises and tried to get rid of all little bits of stock. So we had loads of colorful beads meant for charm bracelets, and loads of silver chains. We really struggled to sell the beads. The marketing genius that my shop owner is, she just stuck a bead on a chain and sold them around Christmas for £14.99. Mainly kids bought them for parents since they couldn't afford more. 

And now the story happened at a busy time about a week before Christmas. I was stood right next to it so I overheard it all. I don't remember exact words but I'll write the point of it. SH \- shop owner, LK \- little kid. 

LK walks in.

&gt;SH \- ""Hello! Are you looking for anything in particular today?""  
&gt;  
&gt;LK \- ""Do you have anything for £5?""  
&gt;  
&gt;SH \- ""I'm sure we can find you something."" She goes off and grabs one of those silver bead necklaces. ""You can have this for £5.""  
&gt;  
&gt;LK \- ""Thank you, it's for my mum.""  
&gt;  
&gt;SH \- hands me the cash to take it to the till. I take it to the till and the shop owner is putting the little box in a bag. She then tells me to go back to the till and bring him £1 change.  
&gt;  
&gt;LK \- starts tearing up.  
&gt;  
&gt;SH \- \(concerned\) ""What's wrong?""  
&gt;  
&gt;LK \- ""My mum has cancer and I really wanted to get her something nice. Thank you."" and he cries even more.

SH \- starts crying, waves me back to the till to bring the £5 back to him. Leans over the counter and hugs the little boy and she tears up as well. Then shoves the £5 note back to him. So they just stood hugging there for a while and crying and then the boy said thanks and was on his way. So the kid walked into the shop with £5. Left with £6 and a necklace for his mum. 

Came home to tell my boyfriend this story, he cried a little bit. My boss is a bit of a perfectionist pain sometimes but at other times she does things like this. ",TalesFromRetail,2413,1527972381
brunettedude,“If you don’t put more cheese on that I will kill you.”,"A lady told me that last night and it’s been bothering me ever since. I absolutely love my job, I know that’s a little odd to say, but it’s true. I work in a small town grocery store and everyone knows each other. I work in the bakery department; we’re so close we’re practically family. Last night I already was staying over an hour late to help finish things for the closer so she wouldn’t have to stay late, and I was asked if I wanted to help the kitchen later that night too. Our town has a party every other week during the summer in the park on Main Street and our store has a stand with food. The lady that was supposed to work was getting married, and considering I love to help out, I told them I would.

All what I had to do was give our burgers and walking tacos to people after they buy them. Since I’m in the bakery, I’m not used to “food prep”; everything I handle is already done, if that makes sense. I’m not a baker, I’m just a clerk. Last night I was getting a lady her walking taco and as I finished putting on her cheese (the regular amount I do for everyone) she stared at me and said with a plain look on her face “if you don’t put more cheese on that, I will kill you.”

By the way her daughter was smiling, I could tell she was just joking. But still.. what the fuck?? I just said OK and added some more cheese and gave it to her, but it keeps bothering me. My life is more important than your fucking cheese, lady. I should’ve just dumped the rest of the cheese in her little bag of Doritos. The rest of my night went great, but I can’t help but to remember what she said.

It’s annoying and downright rude to joke like that with retail people. I’m thankful everyone else that I helped was friendly. I’m sorry to everyone that experiences this more than me...it just feels so degrading. Sending my love your way. ",TalesFromRetail,640,1527964845
savory777,I know the owner,"My parents had owned their store since I was an infant. My dad was a talker &amp; loved swapping stories with customers which made everyone feel like a friend. He was an honest guy who tried to set his prices fairly from the start, so he rarely gave discounts. I spent most of my childhood in the store &amp; by legal age was a paid employee. By my twenties, I was the acting manager &amp; dad worked a more relaxed schedule.  I admittedly look much younger so I was often dismissed as a teenager.
So I always got a kick out of customers who would try “to get one over on me”.
Conversations all followed a similar trajectory:

Me: That’s nice
C: Known him for years...
Me: Me too! 
C: Larry always give me a great deal 
Me: He works hard to keep the prices low
C: Ya, plus since we know each other so well... He always gives me a discount!

At that point I’d pivot to be sure I was looking directly at them, paste a giant smile on my face &amp; say:

Oh? I know him REALLY well too! I call him Dad! 

I’d pause long enough to let their embarrassment settle in &amp; then continue assisting them with my best over the top customer service. 

Shockingly, not a single one ever tried to get that discount at the register.

AcerGray,The Display Chair Situation,"First post, so I apologize for any poor formatting.

So I work at a department store where I'm more or less in charge of the Electronics Department. My end of the store tends to not really have much customer traffic, so I frequently just need to patrol my surrounding area asking if customers need help, putting broken items in the back, etc. 

So, one night I was in the stockroom trying to put away a can opener that someone had removed from the packaging and left on the shelf when I heard a voice from a little ways away in the stockroom. Thinking it was one of my managers or a coworker, I walked over towards them to say hello. Well, turns out the voice belonged to a customer who had wandered into the stockroom and was calling out ""Hello? Hello!"" in an attempt to get someone's attention. I put on my best smile and asked her how I could be of assistance as I escorted her out of the stockroom.

Turns out she wanted to buy a camping chair, which was all fine and dandy, except for the fact that she had taken the chair that she wanted to buy off of our camping display where we have a tent and other camping supplies set up. So, this customer had taken our display apart and was carting the chair around the store, leaving a messed up display in her wake. She asked me to ""check in the back"" for another one of the chairs, because she *really* wanted this specific one.

Now, normally I carry a scanner that I can use to check prices and item stocks, print labels, etc. That night I didn't have one, so I couldn't scan the chair on the spot. As I walked the customer to my register in Electronics where I was able to scan the chair, I tried to explain to her how if this is the only one of these chairs we have, I can't sell it to her, because I'm not authorized to sell our displays. She wasn't listening.

So, we get to my register and I do an On\-hand check, and it turns out we have two of the chairs in stock, one of them being our display chair. The customer, seeing this, says ""Well, that's good! I want both of the chairs, then!""

I had already explained to her that I could not sell her the display chair, but nonetheless I walked her back to the camping goods section to see if we could find the other one. I couldn't find it after looking all over the area, so I eventually just told her that I would call a manager and get help for her.

As I walked back towards electronics so I could call a manager to come out and help, I heard the customer behind me saying ""That's good, because I want both of those chairs!""

I really hope my manager was able to handle it, because I wasn't about to stick around to see how that turned out.",TalesFromRetail,670,1527876012
Amezzeray,Oh The Irony!,"Hey everyone!

So I'm a supervisor in a smallish grocery store. There was only 2 of us on so during a quiet period I took my colleague off for a break and manned the till. This exchange happened as I'm scanning and bagging (M = me. C = customer). This lady, a customer who IS NOT one of our regulars, had 3 small children with her. 

M: So how are you today?

C (while trying to stop the kids touch the counter stock): Not my best day today.

M: Oh no! That's a shame. 

C: People just won't stop hassling me today. I have 3 kids, my fella is away for work and people just won't stop calling me and knocking on my door and... do tell me if I'm boring you.

M: Never you mind (I hold my arms out) rant away at me!

C: It's just... Do you know what it's like to try and please everyone? To smile until your cheeks hurt? (Voice raising quite a bit now) To be polite to absolute inconsiderate... ignorant ... IDIOTS?!?!?!

I look at her and look down at the till, look up at the shop...

M: Well... (Pointing at the surrounding area)

She bursts into laughter, then after a couple of seconds I can't help but chuckle.

As she's paying:

C: Oh thanks for that! I needed a laugh and you've brightened up my day!

M: Glad to help (big effing grin on my face)

Thought this was a worthy one to use as my first entry onto this sub. Exchanges like this are few and far between in our circle. And it's lovely. It's days like this that make me realize that working in retail isn't that bad (most of the time)

sn0tface,I have no cash in my till.,"At my store there are 6 registers, and an hour before closing the manager closes out all but 2 of them.  On very rare occasions we get busy, and I'll have to hop on one of the closed registers and take nothing but debit or credit cards.

I pretty much shout out to the growing line ""I can help you on this register if you are paying with a card!  I have no cash in this till!""

With each customer I repeat the line before I start ringing them up.  I ring up one lady, she pays with her card, and the register prompts me to give her cash back.  I'll be Me, she'll be I Don't Listen Lady, or IDLL.

Me: sorry ma'am, I have no cash in this till.  I cannot give you cash back.

IDLL: What?!  Why didn't you say that before?

Me: I did.  I said I can only accept cards at this register because I have no cash in this till.

IDLL: but that's the only reason I even came into this store! Can't you just get it from another register?

Me: no, because our tills need to balance out at the end of the day.  You can wait in one of those 2 lines for cash back.  Or there are 3 banks surrounding this block.

IDLL: this is ridiculous.

She pays with a card and walks out in a huff.",TalesFromRetail,2236,1527785665
InnocentIchigo,But I need to go pick up my kids NOW,"I will never understand people and their need to come to the store to do something minutes before they need to be somewhere else. But few take the cake like this lady I had around the time I first started.

This takes place about 2 or so years ago right around when I first started my retail job. It was about mid-afternoon, probably around 2:30 or so when we started to get our usual rush. The thing is that depending on the day we either have single shift change (managers changing for the day) or double shift change (both manager and cashier change out) right about this time because that's the way our scheduling works. Thankfully it was just a single shift change on this day. The head manager was helping me ring out as much as he could before he needed to pull his til and prep for the morning deposit (our store is required that both day and night shifts have separate deposits at the end of their respective shifts).

And it was like the wolves suddenly smelled the blood in the air as I suddenly had a line of probably a good 15-20 people in a matter of seconds. Well literally nothing I can do because the manager has to get his money counted and the new manager coming in isn't allowed to jump on until at least 5 minutes before the start of her shift. Any earlier and our hours system will read it as being overtime and we get chewed out by our higher ups--sometimes getting hours cut if we let it happen too much. Besides, I'm quick and as long as there's no serious hick ups or system malfunctions I knew I'd be able to handle things for the 20 or so minutes until the other manager could hop on and help.

Then walks in a woman who I'm guessing takes one look at the line and then one look at me because the next thing I hear is ""Um, I have a return."" Cue our conversation. M = Me, HL = Hurry Lady

I take a glance back and see a bag in her hands as I'm trying to hurriedly scan, bag, and check the person in front of me.

&gt;M: ""I'm sorry, the other register had to close down because we're getting ready for a shift change. It'll still be umm *glances to clock* probably another 15 minutes before the next person will be on. But I can handle returns, if you can get into my line I'll get to you as soon as I can.

&gt;HL: You mean they can't come out and just do my stuff really quick? 

&gt;M: I don't think so but give me a second and I can check. 

So I proceed to get the person I'm checking out to the point of card payment and race to the manager's office like 10 feet away to see if he could possibly hop on for a second just to process her return. Of course he can't because he's just finished writing up the deposit so he wouldn't have a til to use since he'd probably be needing to give her money back. Understandable to me, besides I was sure that I'd probably get through my line before the next manager would even be getting on. So I dart back, apologize for the small wait and hand off the receipt to the customer before getting started on the next person in line, all the while explaining this to HL as best I can. She seemed defeated but seems like she'd rather hop into the line than just wait and watch it grow.

Well either my line was a LOT longer than I thought--which it really wasn't because she was only like maybe 6 people behind my current customer--or something else because barely 5 minutes pass before,

&gt;HL: Is the other person still not ready? I really can't be waiting. 

&gt;M: No sorry, they have to wait until 3 before they can get on and--

&gt;HL: Well I can't wait that long! I need to be getting my kids off the bus by then!

Now I'm frozen for a moment because
1) It's very rare for our store to be anything but a mass of bodies rushing in and out at this time of day.
2) Why would you come to a store that you know is going to be slammed and still expect to be able to pick up your kids who are probably going to be dropped off in mere minutes from now???

&gt;M: I...I'm sorry but there's nothing I can do. Even if they came out now the most they can do is run it through my machine and there's other customers...

&gt;HL: But I need to get to my kids!!

Now I don't know how I got so lucky but the 5 people in front of her all seemed to come to the agreement to just let her go ahead. Whether that was to stop the whining or so kids wouldn't be left alone at a bus stop, I'm not sure which. But god what transpired next. 

She pushes ahead and tosses her bag onto the counter. I quickly toss my keys into the register and open up her bag. There's no receipt. I already know this is going to possibly go badly. With our store if you don't have a receipt and aren't exchanging for anything or buying anything your excess goes onto a store gift card--no buts. Our register literally locks us out of being able to bypass this. I quickly explain this and am thankful when she's fine with it, hoping it's for the sake of just wanting to get out of here quickly. So I set up the type of return it is and scan the first item.

&gt;HL: What's this?!

&gt;M: What? 

&gt;HL: I paid way more than that for the item than it's being returned for.

Immediately I realize what's happening. The items she's returning were seasonal (some fall/harvest candles) and our store was in the process of the last steps of discount before they'd be discounted so we could finish setting up our Christmas seasonal. So even if the price tag on the items reads something like $3 or $8, the current discount was at 90% off so they'd be ringing up for that price.

&gt;M: Oh, that's because these are seasonal items that are on discount right now. 

&gt;HL: So? I paid full price for these a month ago, why are you ringing them up at a discount.

&gt;M: That's how our system works. If you don't have a receipt then we have no way of verifying if they were full price when they were bought. And our system locks us out of changing the price because it's a return of this type.

It doesn't but it sends up red flags from our store because it's in our training to never price change items when doing returns of this type. 

&gt;HL: But I want my money that I paid for back!

&gt;M: Sorry, like I said, I can't do anything on my end. If you want I can keep going through with the return or we can cancel the return and you can keep the items.

&gt;HL: This is ridiculous...fine, fine...I'm sure I have the receipt laying around somewhere. I'll just go home and be right back with it. 

With that she grabbed up her items and stormed out. By this point my line was horrifically long but at least by the time HL left it was only a couple more minutes before the next manager came to start ringing on our other register so we were able to avoid any customer riots.

Came in for work the next day and asked if HL had come back to do the return, she hadn't. So it was likely that she had probably bought them at some point during their discount and was expecting to somehow be returned for their full price, as if the register only noted the discount during sales. It's something that can happen surprisingly often around times when a bunch of our seasonal starts to be discounted. Sorry folks but if anything companies are certainly smart enough to ensure that they never lose a cent more than they have to outside of human error. 

Also let this be a lesson in always keeping your receipts for anything seasonal you buy if you don't want to risk getting back less than what you paid.",TalesFromRetail,798,1527757687

yourgirlalex,Customer purposely bought expensive shoes to wear once and then return them,"Last week a young girl came into my store alone. Since I work in luxury retail, typically when I see teeny boppers or even young adults walk in, I know they're usually just going to waste my time or just do a quick walk in and walk out so this is what I was expecting. 

Young girl was getting ready to graduate High School and wanted a pair of shoes to wear to walk across the stage. She found a few pairs of heels she liked, had me running back and forth for about 20 minutes because she needed different sizes, wanted different colors, etc. She finally settled on a pair of shoes and spent about half an hour walking around the store in them, making sure she liked the height, could walk properly, etc. She took probably 30 or so pictures of herself in these shoes, then took them off and told me:

&gt;""I need to go get my mom's opinion""

I cleaned up the mess of shoes she made and about 20 minutes later she comes back and decides to buy the heels. She pays with two credit cards, a fist full of cash and asks me about the return policy. I tell her she has 30 days to return them as long as they're completely unused and not worn. That was on Friday night.

Flash forward to Monday. I come back from my lunch break and see one of my managers doing a return for two women for a pair of heels. I go over to investigate and find out that just as I suspected, the girl who I *just* sold these heels too had sent her mother and grandmother back to my store to return them and they were completely worn, as the sole and heel were dirty.

I tell my manager over the walkie to not accept the return because they were worn but the girls mother was putting up a fight and so they were issued a full refund. $400. Four hundred fucking dollars that goes back on me and messes up my sales. Worst part is, now we obviously can't sell the shoes since they were worn and can only damage them out.

Funny thing is, I *knew* she was going to do this. Most likely, she wanted a nice pair of designer shoes so she could show off to her buddies and post pictures of herself wearing them on social media but couldn't afford to keep them. I was pissed my manager accepted the return, too. Ruined my day.",TalesFromRetail,3099,1527650523
MustNeedDogs,What a long day does to a person,"I've posted here a couple times before. A little background for this one: My work recently got new credit/debit card machines. Why we installed these memorial day weekend I'll never know, because they are completely different than our old machines, and somehow more complicated.  They had different codes, buttons were in different places, satan created them, etc. 

It was a long, busy, customers streaming in and out, couldn't sit down, kind of day.  My constant line was ""sorry, new machines installed, haven't gotten very good with them yet :)"" The customers were fairly understanding. The machines can be really picky, where they scream at everyone for not inserting the chip has a perfect angle. This happened a lot. 

Towards the end of the day, I was exhausted. I'd been on my feet all day, I had to pee, and I was hungry. All I wanted to do was burn the machines, then take a nap.  About 5 mins to close, another customer, a middle aged woman, walked in. (isn't that how it always goes?) I began the transaction, put the chip in, and, as per tradition, it yelled at me. I went to say my usual ""sorry"" line, but like I said, it was a long day. All I got out was ""sorry, I'm not a good person.""

StainedFingers,That is Not a Parking Spot,"Here's another tale from the world of the self-serve gas attendant.

I typically work the overnight shift, which means that, except for the first and last 90 minutes of my shift, I typically don't have very many customers at once. That said, there are surges of traffic where all four of the lanes I'm in charge of will be occupied, sometimes even with people forced to wait behind them. For this reason, I have to coddle the rare idiot who thinks it's okay to block two lanes at once with their huge truck into moving into one lane. But this guy is something else, and something I hadn't encountered before or since.

A slightly-beat up, mid-2000s sedan pulled into one of my lanes. Ever-vigilant, I immediately approached and greeted the driver, who we shall call $FF, which stands for whatever you think it means.

&gt; Me: Hey, what can I get you?

&gt; $FF: I've just got to run inside.

I assume he's going to retrieve money from the ATM. I was wrong.

&gt; Me: Sure, but I can at least get it started for you. How much do you want?

&gt; $FF: I need to run inside.

Sure, repeat yourself and give me no further information. This time I assumed that, like other poor planners and wasters-of-my-time, he was going to instead use the ATM to see how much he could afford to put in his vehicle. This happens on a nightly basis, because people haven't learned how to park at the store and get their money *before* visiting the gas pumps. I was wrong again. I guess it's true what people say about those who assume.

&gt; Me: Alright, just have the cashier radio me when you know how much you need.

Then comes this gem.

&gt; $FF: I don't need gas.

&gt; Me: What?

&gt; $FF: I've just got to run inside.

I heard you the first two times, but really? I look around to double check I'm still at the gas pumps and haven't been magically transported somewhere else. Nope, there's the familiar concrete ground and scum-covered pumps that haven't been properly washed in months.

&gt; Me: I'm sorry, but you're going to have to park somewhere else.

&gt; $FF: Seriously?

&gt; Me: Yes, I need to keep these lanes open for people who *do* need gas.

&gt; $FF: But I can't park at the store. My car's messed up.

I can only assume he had some problem being able to reverse out of the store parking spots. That said, I didn't question him further about this and he didn't elaborate.

&gt; Me: I'm sorry, but you still can't park here. If you need to, you can park either behind the store in the truck parking or double park in the empty spots along the outskirt of the property. But I need to keep these lanes open.

He gave me a huge look of disbelief, but eventually got back into his car and pulled out. Is it really too difficult to understand that parking in the fuel lanes is only for customers getting fuel?",TalesFromRetail,1871,1527591407
SirArsenic,Worth The Retail Horrors,"Heyo. Normal apologies since I'm on mobile blah blah.

I'm currently a Cashier at a big brand grocery store that also sells toys, makeup, etc. But this story takes place back when I was still a Parcel and Bagger. So around March I believe.

I was bagging as per usual and had just finished up my current customer and spewed out the normal retail spiel about having a good day. Our store chain puts a huge emphasis on interacting with customers and making it a good experience so they'll come back.

So, I looked to see what would come down the belt next when I saw one tiny Transformers toy. It's one of the mystery packet ones where you don't know what you're getting til you open it.

I'm a giant transformers nerd so immediately I looked up to see this mom and her kid. The little boy had, what I now know is called, a Prolouge to Go. Bee is for the boy and M will be me.

M: You like Transformers?

Bee: *presses yes*

M: That's awesome! Who's your favorite?

Bee:*presses Bumblebee and then presses the Autobot sigil button to say Autobots*

Now, I will admit I've got a few tattoos. Coincidentally I had just gotten one done three days prior to this and taken the special wrap off as instructed. It's hidden by my uniform sleeve though. Without going into too much detail, it has the Autobot sigil in it among other things.

I heard what Bee said and then bent down to his level and lifted up my sleeve to show him the sigil.

M: I'm an Autobot too.

Y'all the smile that erupted on Bee's face. He got so excited he actually hugged me. That kid and his excitement made my entire face light up. The mom thanked me for speaking to her son instead of ignoring him and making his day, and I ended up with a huge goofy smile on my face for the rest of the day myself. It's moments like that that make working in retail worth it.

I go over and check. Sometimes when we have products that look identical with different sizes. Usually a $10 difference. So the smaller one was 29.99. That means the one she has is 39.99 and its 70% off on clearance. Something between $11-$12. I go back and tell them this.

The customer just walks out. 

Co - why can't people read or listen. 

Me - i have no idea. It's not that hard.

iloveblacklicorice,The time a customer complained about an imaginary associate,"Loss prevention here!

I was just reminded of a story I wanted to share with you all about a woman who complained about somebody that didn’t exist. 

So, I’m walking the sales floor in my very-obvious loss prevention uniform. All black with “Loss Prevention” written in bold yellow lettering on the back. I’m strolling through the home department, just looking around, when I notice a woman looking at the wind chimes. She didn’t look suspicious, so I kept walking. I leave the area and walk over to the kids department, when I hear a woman’s voice yell, “Excuse me!” from behind me. I’ll be Me, she’ll be W (for woman).

W: “Excuse me!”

Me: “Hey! Can I help you with something?”

W: “Yes, I just wanted to say the way people are being treated in this store is not okay. I’m honestly so embarrassed right now.”

Me: “Ooh, I’m sorry ma’am, what happened?”

W: “I was just in the wind chimes area, and I heard one of your coworkers say ‘There’s a suspicious person in the home area.’ I was the only one in that department, so I know they were talking about me.”

Now, this is strange. Because nothing was said on the walkie. Nobody communicated to me, or any other loss prevention, about a suspicious person. Not only that, but I was just over there and there were no other associates. But, maybe I missed something, so I continued on with her.

Me: “I’m so sorry ma’am, nobody should be calling people out like that. Do you know who said it so I can talk to them about it?”

W: “Yes she was a white lady, with blonde hair.”

Strike two, we don’t have any blonde women working in the store right now. In fact, the only white woman who works at the store is one of the managers, who was off that day. I was the only associate in the home department at the time, and nobody is mistaking me for white or blonde. 

Me: “A lady with blonde hair? That’s odd, we don’t have any blonde associates working right now. Were they wearing our uniform?”

Her whole tone changed after that. She went from concerned to angry in zero seconds flat. 

W: “You know, I just don’t like being accused of stealing. My husband works for the local police department, there’s no way I would embarrass my family by stealing from a discount store! I’m never shopping here again!” 

With that, she walked out. 

Funny thing is, a few months later I saw her come in again. This time she gave me a nasty look as she walked through the door. To be fair, she was in and out in less than a minute.

ZombieLolipop,I didn't bring my ID? You're a b****!,"Cashier at large chain supermarket, etc

This happened a few minutes ago. Had a woman, her dude and their kids buying a cart of stuff, including a 24 pack of beer and some wine coolers. I asked for both their ID's when I got to the beer, and the women proceeds to tell me the law took his ID.

""Wat.""

She repeats herself and I tell her that I'm sorry but without both their ID's I can't sell it. She said the f*** word at least 5 times ""this is f****** stupid, f*** this, f*** ect."", as they leave I smile and tell them to have a good one.

Minutes later I have another set of parents, they have a pack of Gatorade at the front of my belt and the rest towards to back so I slide it down. I hear her say ""why did she just throw our stuff"" so I let her know I was just sliding it down so the rest will come forward. They don't say anything so I figure it's fine.

After ringing up their things, the guy asks for snuff, so I grab it and ask for both of their ID's. She looks livid. ""She's just being a little b**** because of what I said."" 

I smile at her. ""Actually it's so I don't lose my job.""

She says nevermind and for the guy to put the stuff back, they leave, with me saying ""have a good one"" cheerfully behind them.

I took great pleasure in telling my manager that I needed this transaction aborted because I'm a b**** that read the customers mind, and knew she didn't have her ID.",TalesFromRetail,2552,1527214152
LadyLandshark,No you can’t return that- Feeding tube edition,"   This fun story happened a couple months ago. To give a little context, I work customer service, and my store has a strict two week return policy, which it says on the receipt. People are generally not very happy about this, but I don’t make the rules, I just follow them. 

  So one day this lady comes in with her 8 year old son. She has the snobby, easily angered, rich lady look, so I am already so excited to work with her. So she brings up a $200 watch, which she bought three months ago, has been using for three months, and decided she didn’t want anymore. Now sometimes our store makes exceptions for returns outside of policy, if the item is unopened, and only for store credit. But of course, this lady wants to return her opened product and get cash back for it. Now sometimes if I’m not sure about a return, I’ll check with a manager to see if there’s anything we can do. But this is an easy no, so I tell her unfortunately no, we can’t return her watch.

  At this point she gets super triggered and goes into the typical angry customer rant. I won’t bore you with the details, because if you’ve worked retail more than a week you’ve heard it before, but it included lots of yelling about how our store is terrible, going out of business, and she’ll call corporate and blow us up on social media. I have been working here too long to care, so I stare into space and let her yell. 

   Eventually she asks for my manager, I’m guessing because she realized that she wasn’t getting anywhere with me. And the second he gets there, she completely changes her tactic. This woman, who was yelling and swearing at me thirty seconds ago, breaks into tears. Not just a little pout, like she is full on sobbing, with a shaky voice and panicked breathing and everything. 

  So here’s how the conversation with the manager goes. L is the lady, M is my manager.


L: I just really need to return this watch, I had no way of coming in any sooner, and I really need my money back 

M: Sorry, unfortunately it is outside of our return policy, so the company rules say that you can’t get cash back

L: *sobs loudly* Please, I’ve been so busy taking care of my son. He has a feeding tube!

  When she says this, she points at her son, who takes off his shirt to show the feeding tube.

M: Uhh ma’am, I don’t need to see that.

  Now at this point, I would like to mention that I used to be a nanny for a toddler who had a feeding tube, and I realize that there can be medical complications, and doing the feed is kind of a pain, but you can still leave the house and live a normal life. And also, the kid has been skipping around knocking things off the shelves, and does not seem bedridden at all. Plus the fact that he showed his feed tube on cue kinda made me wonder if she did this often? So her using her kid as an excuse didn’t give me a lot of sympathy. My manager however, was cracking under the pressure.

M: Look, I’ll make an exception this one time, because normally we’re not supposed to return opened items outside of policy, but I can return it to a store credit for you.

   At this point, the lady started sobbing like someone she loved had died, which was the breaking point for the manager. He completely caved, and told her we’d return it for cash like we wanted, leaving me wondering why we even have a return policy, and then the lady came behind the counter and started hugging him.

  So that was fun. Gotta love when following the rules is the wrong choice.",TalesFromRetail,1530,1527177428
TheAppalaciaRose,When my store was mistaken for the morgue.,"This happened yesterday.

Anyway, for some background: I work at a hardware store- I'm specifically a cashier. Not very exciting. I have another non retail job on the side of this one to keep me sane.

It was around the last hour we were open. The phone rings, and I give my typical line: ""(store name), how may I help you?"" 

Person on other line with be POL.

&gt;POL: ""Hi, my name is (insert name) and I am a hospice nurse of (insert name of her patient here). I just wanted to let you know he is deceased as of an hour prior and the body needs to be picked up."" (it went something like that. Not word for word but you get the idea)

Uh...What in the world?

&gt;Me: ""....Um, this is (insert my store name)?""

&gt;POL: ""Oh, shoot! I must have dialed the wrong number! I'm so sorry!""

&gt;Me: ""It's okay. Have a great rest of your evening.""

Definitely the weirdest wrong call I've gotten at my store to date and I was not expecting that at all.

Festoev,"If Another Woman Could Do It, Then Why Can’t You?!","[Sorry! Mobile]

(Backstory: I work in a department/grocery store. I work inside the store in a department. I’m a smaller built young girl; who can’t lift more than 10 pounds and suffers from lightheaded ness/dizziness due to low blood sugar. So I try to not push myself too far at work and I keep candy on me in case!)

My coworker asked me if I could come outside to the Garden Centre Register (not my department at all) so he could help load a large order into a car. He was alone because the other Garden employee was on break. I gladly accepted because it was nice and cool out! (It’s been raining so today was chilly) 


{ I rang up a few customers for flowers, when a lady with a big cart of large bags of mulch pulled up.

Me: “Hello! How many-“

Woman: (cutting me off) “10.”

Me: “Okay! Thank you!” (Scanned them all and told her her total. Then she paid.)

Woman: “I’m going to drive my car around.”

(I didn’t really understand what she meant. So I’m sure my face made a visible “???”)

Woman: “I’M GOING TO DRIVE MY CAR AROUND. DO. YOU. UNDERSTAND. WHAT. I’M. SAYING?!”

Me: “Oh! Did you want help loading your car up?”

Woman: “YES OBVIOUSLY!”

Me: “Okay! I’m sorry. I wasn’t sure what you meant.. I don’t work out in this department, I’m just watching the register so my coworker could load a car for a customer. I can’t lift that though, so if you don’t mind waiting, my coworker will be back in a minute and he can help you load it!”

Woman: “YOU can do it JUST fine with TWO people!! WHY CAN’T YOU DO IT?! A WOMAN helped me earlier!! I’ve been here 4 times already!!”

Me: “I’m sorry.. I don’t have a lot of body strength.. I wouldn’t be able to lift those..”

Woman: “FINE! I’ll just wait for your coworker!!” (She pulled her car up to the gate, hopped out, and came back to the register) “WELL are you STILL alone or is your coworker back yet?!”

Me: “He should be back any minute..”


She left to sit in her car. Not even a minute later my coworker got back. I asked him if he wouldn’t mind helping her. He gladly did and was surprised when I told him how she treated me. I guess she was really nice to him. }


I just wish people would be more considerate of other people limitations. Not everyone is capable of the same things.

GoggleCandy,"""How is that fair?!"" Because you lied.","In a previous story, I mentioned running and judging larger tournaments of a popular card game for a store that I volunteer and occasionally work for. This past weekend we had a regional event for the card game and, as seems to be the trend, I had an angry player over the age of 30 (the average age range tends to be between 18-24, so it sticks out).

I'm designated as the Head Judge for the event, so I usually have to be ready for any ruling appeals or larger issues. One of my newest judges came up to me saying he was uncomfortable dealing with a situation at a table. I say it's fine and ask him the situation, though he says it'll be easier to see.

When I reach the table, I see one player (L for Liar) red faced staring at the other player (IC for Innocent) who had his hands on the table looking a little shaken. I see a mess of cards on the table, all face down and in an unsteady line across the board. I begin to ask IC what's up

L: ""Are you going to let me speak?!""

Me: ""Yes, but I want both sides first as I'm coming in blind""

IC explains that the building's AC kicked in and caught his deck, throwing a number of cards off the table. He put down his hand of cards and picked them up. Before he shuffled them back to his deck, L stopped him saying that that constitutes a game loss and had immediately called a judge.

Me: ""Alright L, did what IC say happen?""

L: ""Yeah, but it doesn't matter. It's irreversible game state (means something has happened that the game cannot continue due to a large error that a reasonable person would not be able to adjust or fix) which means he loses this game. I don't know what was in his hand. He could've switched cards with his deck or added cards and his deck isn't the way it was. It's in a totally new order, that's irreversible.""

Something feels off. I see the game state, I know how many cards each player should control, and I see the IC's hand in front of him. So I just poke L for clarification.

Me: ""So you do agree that the AC accidentally knocked cards off his deck onto the floor?""

L: ""Yeah, I saw it.""

Me: ""And you stopped him from shuffling those cards into his deck after he picked them up?""

L: ""Yeah, I don't know if he did something with the cards or put any card into his hand.""

Me: ""Why not?""

L: ""He did it while I was reading his *points to IC's card in play* card's text and distracted.""

It clicked what actually happened in my mind.

Me: ""So you saw his deck get disturbed by an outside force like he said, to which he goes to pick them up but you suddenly decide to read his card's text rather then continue to watch your opponent pick up cards, and now say it's irreversible and you don't know what he did with his hand even though it is both players' responsibility to keep track of the game state and it's common sense to watch your opponent if something like that happened? My ruling is you stopped paying attention because you immediately wanted him to get a game loss due to something out of his control that IS a repairable game state as the only cards knocked over were a randomized stack of cards. If you wanted clarification on what to do in that situation, that would have been fine, but I do not like being lied to. He will shuffle these cards into his deck and you two will resume the game from there. I am not ruling a game loss in this instance.""

L just about flipped in his seat, but accepted it and they continued playing. He had multiple salty flip outs throughout the event and he'll now be watched more closely at future events.",TalesFromRetail,2091,1527000729

I go back to my main spot and he sits there for 9 minutes, and at 12 I come over and ring them up. I explain that since it's alcohol I have to approve it real quick then he can pay.

""...Alcohol? Is alcohol?""

""Yes.""

sapphicpenguin,Mom of the Century,"A few years ago, I worked as a cashier at a big box store. During my first holiday season at the store, we had every register open and we were Not Allowed to Leave Our Register for Any Reason \(except, of course, when we went on break\). Well, one day I was on one of the registers by the Pokemon cards. A boy came over who looked to be about 9 or 10. He didn't say anything, just looked at the cards. Every once in a while, he'd go to the end of the lane and look around a little. Then he'd go back to looking at the cards.

I started to get concerned. Every time he went to the end of the lane, he walked a little further out. I knew something wasn't right and he'd been alone by the cards for upwards of fifteen minutes. So, the next time he walked out to the main aisle and looked around, I went up to him. For this, I will be Me and he will be B for Boy:

&gt;Me: Is your family here, sweetie?  
&gt;  
&gt;B: \*nods his head\*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Do you know where they are?  
&gt;  
&gt;B: \*shakes his head no\*

So I found myself with a lost kid. Seeing as I wasn't allowed to leave the register, I had two options: I could disobey orders and leave my post to get this kid to Customer Service where we could page his parents or I could remain following the directive and just keep an eye on him. I chose the only option I thought was right and took him to Customer Service. 

I walked him up to the counter and explained that he was lost. It took a little coaxing, but we got his mom's name. One of the ladies at Customer Service paged for her. I wanted to stay with him, but I had to get to my post so I told him to stay with the name Customer Service ladies and went back to my register. 

I could still see Customer Service from where I was, so I kept looking back to see if his mom came to get him. Every time I looked, he was still over there. I was getting really worried. Were his parents even still in the store?

Finally, about twenty minutes after the initial page \(they called it out a couple more time\) his mom finally came to pick him up. She looked like one of those reality television moms with the bleach blonde hair and outrageous style. She looked basically like [Jennifer Coolidge in A Cinderella Story](https://imgur.com/a/1AokNpW). And, based on her facial expression and body language, she was annoyed at being asked to come get her own child. I felt terrible for that poor child, but what more could I do.

I'd still see them in the store every once in a while. My opinion of her never rose \(especially because I once checked them out and she acted like Jennifer Coolidge in A Cinderella Story too\), but at least every time I saw them from then on she kept him at her side. So maybe she learned something after all.",TalesFromRetail,1204,1526759252
Octoember,YOU’RE SO RUDE says the woman who spent the entire transaction on her phone.,"So my workplace is tiny and because of that all of our self serves and manner register are directly across from each other, less than 8 feet away.

sam5232,This vacuum is in great condition so I should get it free,"Greetings TFR! Working in home appliances, we often get some stingy and cranky customers. Today was a bit different. I usually prefer selling large appliances, but I also help customers looking for smaller appliances like microwaves, vacuums, etc. An older looking guy comes into the store and goes into the vacuum section, while I just got out of helping a different customer in large appliances. I get signaled by the guy to head to the vacuum part of the store.
 Me will be me and DG will be Discount Guy.

&gt;DG: Sir, I need your help.
&gt;Me: Sure, what can I help you with?
&gt;DG: Well you have a vacuum over here on &gt;closeout that’s more expensive than the &gt;advertised sale price.

The vacuum on closeout looks brand spanking new. I mean it looks like someone took it home, decided they didn’t want it, and brought it back to the store. No scratches, it operates like it’s barely been used, all-in-all a pretty good deal.

&gt;Me: Oh, we might’ve had a sale going on for that item and a new closeout tag wasn’t printed. I can take off the difference to give you a lower sale price.

This is not rare, but I understand what happened. This vacuum is currently on sale for $199 and the closeout vacuum is going for $209. It’s original advertised price when not on sale is usually like $299 so the $209 is a good deal for a closeout/clearance vacuum.

&gt;DG: Let’s go look at it. 
&gt;(Walks to vacuum)
&gt;DG: Just so you know, I can also take *FREE*
(Brief pause)
&gt;DG: Free is always an option.
&gt;Me: Yeah, sure (sarcastic)

I get to the vacuum and inspect its condition. Again, perfectly good, no scratches, runs great, probably barely used.

&gt;DG: see? The closeout price is higher than the sale price! 
&gt;Me: I do notice that sir. I can give you a reduced price for the inconvenience.
&gt;DG: how much of a reduced price?
&gt;Me: based on the condition of the closeout vacuum, I’ll be allowed to give you about a $20 reduction from the advertised sale price.
&gt;DG: That’s *it*??
&gt;Me: I mean it’s in great condition. If it was really beaten up in a terrible condition with lots of scratches then yes I can give you a much reduced price. 
&gt;DG: it definitely has some scratches on it!
(No it didn’t)
&gt;Me: I’m sorry sir, I’m only allowed to give you the price we discussed earlier. 
&gt;DG: I was hoping to get it for free... well I’ll keep looking.

How on earth would a price difference like that, especially on an item that was over $200, cause us to give it to him for free? ",TalesFromRetail,686,1526683567
BlindArchers,Welcome to the electronics department! Why are you wearing a ski mask?,"This happened about two months ago now but it's definitely one of the weirder things I've seen while working retail. 

It's a slow Saturday night. There's only two people in electronics - me, your semi friendly wireless associate, and a general electronics associate who also handles a couple of other departments. 

I'm ringing up a customer when I see a man walk up to the laptop and tablet demos. Pretty averagely dressed: jogging pants and a hoodie with the hood up. 

Oh, and he has a ski mask on and a large, semi filled duffel bag under his arm. 

Oh boy... 

The electronics associate comes back to the department and I quietly ask him to keep an eye on Mr Ski Mask while I finish with the customer. We finish and she leaves, and a security guard from the front of the store appears.

We try and act as if nothing out of the ordinary is going on, which I fail at, constantly letting out loud, nervous giggles after every sentence. Mr Ski Mask keeps looking at the laptops, regularly pulling up the ski mask as high as he could over his face (cuz he didn't look suspicious enough).

Eventually, he asks the electronics associate for help with a laptop. As he's opening the cage, I'm thinking *This is it. He's gonna pull something out of the duffel bag, wack him over the head, and snatch all the laptops.*

Nope. Electronics guy pulls out a laptop and they walk back to the registers. 

The order is being rung up and Mr Ski Mask pulls out a bunch of cash - almost all small bills - to pay (~~paying for expensive electronics in cash? nope, no red flag here~~). And this is where my mind goes haywire again. *As soon as the register pops open, he's gonna pull out a gun and demand all the money inside.*

Once again, nothing happens. Mr Ski Mask finishes his transaction. He takes his brand new laptop and makes a beeline to the front of the store with the security guard following closely behind. 

I'm still not quite sure what the hell that was about...

tl;dr - WE DIDNT GET ROBBED! :D",TalesFromRetail,1864,1526676323
lovebug_4909,Refused to serve,"Hello! This tale happened to me about 5 years ago. I was working for a large retail company at the time as a cashier. I was about half way through my shift when a middle aged woman and an older woman (most likely her mother) came to my checkout lane. This woman had 2 large grocery carts full of stuff, mostly food. As I started ringing out the items from the first cart I could tell by the way she was talking to her mother that she was kind of grumpy. I figured I should relieve the tension and say something, so I went on with the regular greetings”hello, how are you? etc” she starts her response and seemed more cheerful and then her attitude turned really sour fast as I started ringing up the lunchables she threw up on the belt. I had rung up maybe 3 and she says “you need to change the price, this is supposed to be $1.00.” They we’re ringing up at $1.25.  I would have changed the price no problem for 1 or 2 of them, however she had 27 (we counted all of them) on the belt. That was more than what I was authorized to change the price of (can usually do a price adjustment if the total is under $1.00 without a manager having to be present) so I said to her that I would have to get my supervisor to do the change. This did not make her happy. She is now raising her voice and says “they are $1.00, change the price, here is a picture of the sign over by them for proof.” At this point she shows me a picture of just the $1.00 part of the sign, I can’t see anything else in the picture. Usually on one of the signs there is an expiration date for certain prices, and there is always a label telling you what the product is. So, not really knowing if it was for the lunchables or not, I say, “when my manager gets here she will be happy to help adjust to the right price.”  Now, my manager was the only one on and was watching a couple additional departments, so she just so happened to be on the other side of the store when I sent her a request through the register for assistance. Knowing it was going to be a moment I voided out the lunchables entirely and was staring on other things on the belt when she said, “stop! I don’t want you to ring anything up until your manager comes here and fixes this.” I’m thinking: ok, just waste my time and yours, but whatever because I get paid hourly anyway. So I said “my manager will be here shortly, can I help you unload your cart while we wait?” I thought it was a nice offer, but she wasn’t having any of it, and was clearly pissed off by her sharp “NO” response. So about another minute goes by of the most awkward silence and trying not to make eye contact when my manager finally shows up, my manager (also a she, but will refer to as manager not to make it confusing) says the usual, hello, I’m the manager,  how can I help phrase, and the customer (who I will refer to as she from here on out) replied “she (meaning me) won’t change the price of these. They are a $1.00 and I want them at that price! See!” She shoves the phone in my managers face, and seeing what I saw, and knowing I did the correct thing by calling her (my manager) to make a large price adjustment says, “I see that they are $1.00, however I can’t see the label on this picture. If you don’t mind waiting another moment I just have to run and check the price tag on the shelf for verification.” At this she walks away really quickly because my manager can also sense how angry this woman is. The woman after the manager is out of earshot and is no longer visible pulls a label (from our shelf) out of her back pocket and shoved her hand in my face saying, “see, this is $1.00, change the price!” I inspect the label and notice it’s and old one (I think it was 2 or 3 weeks later at this point) and say, “thank you, but this is an expired price tag, as long as the price is still the same on the shelf, my manager would be happy to change the price for us when she gets back.” This is when the woman realized she screwed up. She gets very upset and turns bright red and starts screaming, “just change the price now!” And I to say “we will adjust them accordingly in just a moment when my manager gets back.” This was unsatisfactory to her because she screams again, “tell the manager to hurry the fuck up, you all are fucking useless!” I have been growing more grumpy the longer I have been exposed to this woman so I say trying to get her attention, “ma’am we are trying...” and cutting me off mid sentence, she leans over the register and try’s to hit me in the face. Luckily I have very quick reflexes so I managed to dodge it. At this point I’m crying, and my manager was walking up behind the woman and saw everything that just happened. I was standing there shocked as my manager had grabbed the new label off the shelf and was explaining to her what the price would be and that the current price they were ringing up was accurate. The woman, defeated but still angry, says, “hurry up and finish this then!” She was motioning to me to finish ringing up her groceries. I, remembering from my training, decided to do the only thing that I could to keep myself away from this woman, “No, I will not, she tried to hit me.” At this point I’m crying and just walked away from my register. I hear her angrily talking to her mother from around the corner where I sat until my manager finished ringing her up. My manager came to check on me and said it was all on tape, and to go talk to the security guy to pull the footage so we could keep her from coming back in our store. I went and chatted with him for a few minutes until I calmed down and while we were finding the footage, we discovered that this woman was on a watch list for stores in our area anyway. I was not the only cashier she had been aggressive with, nor was this the first time she tried to pull off the price change stunt. I never saw her again.

I have worked in retail for 6 years. This was near the start of that, had a few promotions between then and now, and have dealt with a lot more customers. This, however, has been the only person I have refused to serve.

sowasteland,We are not babysitters.,"At my store, we have a policy that children 12 and under must have an adult with them. If we see a child unattended in the store, we simply tell them that they need to be with a parent. We have good reasons for this. Parents leave their kids unattended in toy isles where they not only break things and make a mess, but also climb on shelves and try to get items off of top shelves, which could cause them to get hurt. For this reason we have become very strict with this policy as summer approaches. I’ve had a few people make complaints, but this one sticks out. 

This woman called the store, demanding to speak to the manager, at which point I told her I was. She was angry because one of my employees had “kicked her 10 year old daughter out” while she (the mother) was at the store next to ours, and that was against the law. I explained that her daughter had to have a parent with her, since she was under 13, and explained the potential risk. The woman just continued yelling loudly enough that the customer I was serving commented on it after the conversation was over. I thought, how could you really complain that you have to be with your child in a store? 

Thought that was over with. Then, I hear about a conversation on Facebook about how our policy is illegal because our state doesn’t have a law that requires parents to be with their kids, so she can sue (yes, because that’s how the law works, since there isn’t a law against it, it’s illegal for companies to make a policy against it). Something about “free range kids”. 

Yeah, okay. Free range your kids somewhere else. ",TalesFromRetail,689,1526592681
bobafett8192,WTF Is Going On?,"Sorry for any mobile formatting errors. 

So as some of you might have read from my previous posts, I work at a cellular provider. The day was like any other day recently: slow as hell. The phone rings and I'm the first one to pick it up. 


So you need to know a little bit about our warranties for this to make sense. We have no warranty phones in store, and we don't ship warranty phones to our store. It always goes directly to the customer. On top of that, prepaid phones have no warranty. 


AC will be angry customer and I'll be ME.


ME: Thank you for calling *store* how may I help you? 


AC: Yes I was trying to see if my phone was the yet. 


ME: *thinking it's a pickup order* What's the name with it?


AC: Angry customer. 


ME: I don't see anything here for that name. Was it a warranty claim? 


AC: Yeah my phone wasn't working. 


ME: Well we don't ship warranty phones to our store. It's most likely going directly to your home address. 


AC: What the fuck are you talking about? I need to speak to your boss man.


ME: There's nothing they can tell you that I can't. What's your phone number so I can look up the order and tracking info? 


AC goes on a rant cussing and screaming but finally tells me his number. And of course, it's a prepaid phone. There's no order, no notes mentioning an order. The only notes were from 2 months ago telling him to try the phone's manufacturer. I tell him this and he gets more upset. I finally tell him to call customer service to complain if he wants and he hangs up. There's another call immediately after, and I here the same heavy breathing as before then he hangs up. 


So I think everything is done. Skip an hour and I answer the phone again. It's the same guy. He immediately starts apologizing for cussing me out saying if I only knew that he was going through I would understand. Right. I tell him I'll check through our inventory, but of course find no phone for him. He says he'll just come to the store to figure it out and hangs up. Oh joy. 


Another few hours pass and I'm helping a customer when one of my coworkers tells me there's someone waiting on me. I look over and it's him. He looks like a crazy homeless guy that might stab me. I take my time with my current customer hoping he'll either leave or get someone else to help him. 


A few minutes pass and I suddenly notice that he's sitting on the ground. Weird, but I've seen weirder. Next thing I know an ambulance shows up outside and EMT staff are attending to the guy. He claims he hit his head and needs to go to the hospital. The EMT staff don't believe a word he's saying as he's obviously trying to blame our store for the injury that doesn't exist. The cart him off to the hospital. I still have no idea what the hell happened, but I'm glad I never got near him or I'd probably be named in a lawsuit. ",TalesFromRetail,2194,1526573354
cerebral_drift,Today I realised I live in the future,"I got a call at work today. A woman called me claiming to be Google Maps, and she wanted to know our opening hours. We went through what hours we were open for weekdays, clarified the weekends, and said goodbye. She never told me her name, and her responses were a bit odd, but I put it down to a language/cultural barrier as her accent was south\-east asian and I live in Australia. it was otherwise unremarkable.

I told the Store Manager \(I'm the Assistant Manager\), and his first response was ""Was it a person?""

I said ""Yeah, of course.""

He said ""Are you sure?""

Then it dawned on me. I checked Google and our hours were already updated, but one day was slightly wrong. It's logistically impossible to have to manpower to call every establishment and confirm their opening hours.

I wasn't talking to someone from Google Maps. I was talking TO GOOGLE MAPS. I was talking to a computer, and I had absolutely no idea. Wow.",TalesFromRetail,6061,1526463871
Busted_Nails,"""Can I have a discount? This dress is damaged""","I used to work in a thift/charity store in the UK.

One time we got a donation of lipsy dresses, all with the original tags still on them (RRP of £80/$108).

These donations are rare and a holy grail for thrift stores, they have saved our store from closing more than once (used clothing we generally sold for £2/$2.70).

The first thing we always do is dress the mannequins in them, and price them modestly at £20/$27.

Within 15 minutes of doing so, a woman stumbles in from the street, clearly drunk, asking to try on the dress.
My stomach sank but I took it off the mannequin and showed her where the dressing rooms were.

After a few minutes I hear a loud noise, so clearly audible it was ridiculous, of fabric being ripped.

Not much longer after that the woman comes out, serious expression plastered on her face; she lays the dress down on the counter and lifts up the underskirt, the entire thing is ripped vertically.

&gt;""Excuse me, this dress has a big rip in it, could I 'ave some money off of it? Not payin' bloody tweeny quid for tha' ""

I kept my cool, looked this woman dead in the eye and said

&gt;""Oh, thank you for pointing that out, unfortunately, that means this dress is unsuitable for sale, I have to go throw it in the garbage now.""

She lost her composure completely demanding I sell it to her for a reduced price but I stood firm and said 
&gt;""Sorry, store policy""

A total lie but f**k her at this point.

She eventually sunk her head down and left dejected.

Once I told the shop manager what happened, she bought it for the price we marked it at and took it home and re-sewed it herself to wear in the summer, which I thought was cute/sweet.

Didn't go to waste in the end.

GoggleCandy,When I got yelled at for not being omnipresent,"I live above and volunteer at a hobby gaming store every Saturday running tournaments for a specific card game. Our store does well enough that every few months, we host a Regional tournament at a space we rent out. Attendance is usually around 100+ people, we have reporting station, an area for game judges, and a small store area.

One of my jobs before hand is finding official judges in the surrounding area to volunteer. They walk the floor and answer questions if a ruling is needed. If one of both players have issues with the ruling, they can contest it which is when I am called over. Otherwise, the ruling stands. This is needed to know the context of AG (Angry Guy) and UF (Unfortunate Friend) and Me.

During the last round, we are waiting on the last few tables to report when UF comes up to me asking about a ruling on how two cards interact. It was admittedly a unique ruling and, after verifying the answer, I told him. He seemed both happy and annoyed, but thanked me and walked off. About 5 minutes later, I see AG making those angry motions with his body and speaking to two people and one of my judges in a raised tone. I walk over.

Me: Is there an issue?
AG: Yeah! Me and UF are tired of getting screwed over at these events! It's bulls**t!
Me: Mind informing me what happened?
AG: One of your judges gave my buddy the wrong ruling and was helping his friend to get Top 8. (The top 8 players received prizes)

*I look over at UF who is merely watching one of the last games play out across the room*

Me: Well, if UF thought there was an issue with the ruling, that's why I'm here. He needed to contest the ruling.
AG: Man ... you should know who your judges friends are here! Stop screwing us!
Me: I have duties to perform. I cannot watch every game nor am I going to question the abilities of my judges. If there is an issue with a ruling, you need to call the Head Judge.

*AG is getting angrier and I'm suspecting he may have been drinking at some point. During cleanup, we did find a few nips hidden under tables*

AG: Man, f**k you! You should know everything about your judges and when a s**t ruling is being given. This is your event! You need to stop this s**t!
Me: I can't watch every game at all times. That's why I have floor judges. That's their whole job. I'm here amongst other things to answer ruling issues when called or contested. 
AG: No! Because you judges keep screwing us so why should we trust you?!
Me: So, I need to do more as a judge but you don't trust me to do more, yet it's my fault UF didn't advocate for himself while I'm across the room.

*AG then begins swearing up and down about how it's a conspiracy against him and UF at all these events and that all the judges in the Northeast are screwing specifically them over.*

When I realized he wasn't going to listen to logic, I walked away as I still had responsibilities to attend to. My boss told me if they come to the next event, that AG would be barred from attending. I've had angry players approach me and it's amazing how often they ignore clear cut logic and rules and blames the staff for their errors.",TalesFromRetail,941,1526394973
GoldMidnight,"""Get Me My Box! It's YOUR Job!""","I thought I'd go ahead and post this short but not-so-sweet story from yesterday, when I was cashiering out in the garden center. My store has a booth for two of the garden registers, and on the main side there's a little open cabinet type thing with cardboard boxes to hold your plants in so they don't spill in the car or whatever. I was on the side that didn't have boxes at this point in time. I'll be me, and the customer will be C.

My coworker was ringing up C and I was putting a guy's payment through when C flagged me down, completely ignoring my coworker.

&gt;C: ""I want boxes for my tomato plants.""

&gt;Me: ""Oh, we have some just over there."" She was about four steps away from the boxes, literally.

&gt;C: ""I have to get them myself? It's self-serve?""

&gt;Me: ""Yeah, you can choose which boxes you want that way.""

&gt;C took a couple of steps before turning back to me with a huffy look on her face: ""No, it's _your_ job to do it for me, so you get them!""

I stared at her for a moment since she was two steps away from the boxes and way closer than I was.

&gt;Me: ""I'm with a customer right now, but once I'm done I'll help you."" Cue bright retail smile.

C glared at me and ended up getting her own damn boxes. My customer's receipt printed out two seconds later, and I kept an eye on C and my coworker to make sure C wasn't giving her a hard time. We're more than happy to get polite customers boxes for their plants, most people honestly just prefer to pick their boxes themselves.

Lawsomepossom,"""You didn't have to do that..""","I used to work at a ""bakery"" in the mall that mostly sold cookies and cookie-cakes. We only make the cakes by order (although it only has to be 15-30 minutes in advance), and keep all of the completed order forms for about a week in case there are any issues, discrepancies, etc. 

One day, I am helping customers as usual, and this nice couple hands me a $50 that they apparently found in front of the cash register. I was pretty stunned that not only a) did someone drop $50, but b) that this couple didn't just snatch it and run. 

I took it to the back, and noticed it was triple folded in a strange way; not enough to be done on purpose, but too creased to be from a tri-fold wallet. I remembered one older gentleman who had just payed for a cookie cake about 5 minutes earlier with a card from a money clip, so I went to the completed order box, called the number and got his Wife on the phone (W).

Me: Hi, this is Name from Store, could you ask the gentleman who picked up this cake to come back, we think he left something at the counter.

W: He's still in the mall, I'll go ahead and let him know!

[couple minutes later, gentleman (GM) arrives]

Me: Hello Sir! Have you happened to noticed anything missing?

GM: Well, I got a call from my wife saying I had, so I checked everything, my keys, clip, phone. I'm pretty sure I've lost a $50 bill actually.

I pulled it out of my back pocket, and he is completely dumbfounded. 

GM: That's incredible.. You know you didn't have to do that..

Me: [something trying to sound noble, can't quite remember]

He ended up handing me a $10 as a Thank-You, which was my largest tip over the 2 years I spent there.

soliloquii,“Call the owner because the customer is always right!”,"This just happened today.
I work in a small retail store from hell in a high end mall. 

We carry many brands of bags, one brand we will call “T” 

Mind you, in this mall, there is also the main store for the brand “T” where they carry more products from that brand. They are our competition since they are the main store.


On Sundays we close at 6:00 PM. This loud woman (LW) and her husband walks in at 5:50. Guess who is going home late again... 

She grabs a backpack.

LW: How much is this T backpack? I want to buy it for my husband. 

Me: Well it is usually [price] however the store is offering a small 10% discount because of Mother’s Day.” 

LW: Only 10% off? That’s it, well the store T is offering more than that! They are doing a 15% off!” 

Me: That’s not possible since we carry the same exact brand and we have the same prices. Plus the brand notifies us whenever there will be a sale” 

LW: (changes her story) Actually no, not T store, never mind, I saw this same exact backpack downtown! The lady offered me 15% off !! 

ME: .... Well what store is it? 

LW: a store DOWNTOWN! 

Me: .... ok ...maybe it’s a different model.. *I scan the bag and add our 10% discount* 

Me: ok so it will be [price] plus tax.

LW: You’re not going to give me a discount?? 

Me: Sorry, the discount offered is 10%

LW: But the lady downtown offered me a 15% off! Can’t you call the owner so he can give me an additional 5%? Call him. Call him because the customer is always right! 

Me: I can’t call the owner. He let us know yesterday that we are allowed to give a 10% off discount maximum in any store item. No more than that. 

LW: But the woman downtown showed me in her screen that the system lets her give her a 15%! Can’t you do that? 

Me: You’re right, I can put in whatever discount in the system. I can put in 15% or even a 20% but the owner strictly said 10% only...the T store isn’t even doing any discount at all. 

LW: Well the owner should offer more than that.. 

Me: .... (I choose not to respond and ignore her at this point to avoid escalating the situation)

LW’s husband then tells me it’s fine and that he’ll pay for the bag

He hands me his card and then he politely asks me to monogram the bag. I monogram it. LW just pulls out her phone and tries to find the bag cheaper I assumed however she didn’t find anything. The husband is happy with his bag and thanks me. They both exit the store. 

I ended up leaving at 6:30.. however, we are commissioned and it was an expensive bag he purchased..

ToastyToast78,Too Impatient to Save Herself the Trouble,"Background: I work as a front end manager at a big-box retailer. We offer in store pickup for online orders, and guarantee the order will be ready within 2 hours if the items are in stock at our location and the order is placed during business hours.

Our first guest of the morning today walks in 5 minutes after we open and wants to pick up her order. I look it up and see that it hasn't been filled yet because she only placed the order about 2 hours ago--outside of business hours.

""But your website says it will be ready in 2 hours!""

I explain to her why it isn't ready yet, and add that the fulfillment team is working on the overnight orders right now, so it will likely be ready soon.

""Nah, I'll just cancel it and buy the items in store since I know you have them in stock.""

It's at this point that I start to see the train wreck coming. Her order is for a patio furniture set, a large outdoor bench, and a rolling cart, any one of which she would need help from the salesfloor team to bring up to check out and load into her car.

Of course, while she's gone one of the fulfillment guys brings up the items for her order. A few minutes later, someone from the sales floor brings up the exact same items... the ones she wants to purchase in store. Now we have two of everything cluttering up the checklanes. She pays for one of each and walks out to pull her car in front of the doors.

A minute later she drives up in a tiny blue sedan.

Salesfloor guy attempts to help her load her stuff into the car, and impressively manages to squeeze in the patio set and cart (both disassembled and in boxes). But the bench will not also fit.

What does the guest decide to do? She wants to return the bench and buy something else instead! Thankfully, she puts her car back in a parking spot first. Now she wants one of those metal fire pit things, so salesfloor guy goes and gets one for her while I return the bench.

To top it all off, when she goes to purchase the fire pit, her credit card won't go through any more because of the not-yet-processed return and cancelled online order, so she has to call her card company and get that straightened out.

They explain to her that until the refunds can process her card is basically maxed out, so she decides not to get the fire pit either, and finally leaves.

(Almost) all of that could have been avoided if she had just waited an extra few minutes when I told her that her order would be ready soon.

The only two things that make me slightly less irritated by this are that it was early so we weren't very busy yet, and that the guest herself was for the most part understanding and not rude with us. She was visibly frustrated but didn't resort to yelling or screaming, which I appreciated.

Bonus side note: why is it that when people buy huge TVs or furniture or stuff like that, 9 times out of 10 they come to pick it up in a tiny car?

Mr114,It worked perfectly before. Now it doesn't!,"So, this is my fourth tale from an independent bicycle shop ([First](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/2640eu/thats_what_im_going_to_do_im_going_to_play_the/), [Second](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/32xelm/tell_him_to_change_it_or_ill_bloody_shoot_him/) and [Third](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/3ekuvd/i_missed_my_fucking_race_because_of_you_pricks/) right here). This one was not too long ago. There's a lot of phone calls in this story, and it's a very long one.  
  
So, I receive a phone call from a customer asking if we are able to take his bike apart completely so he can get the frame and forks resprayed, then re-build it again. I tell him this is no problem, and we would just charge him for a Full Service (I actually went in too low with the price here as it's a fair amount more work than a regular Full Service but, it doesn't really matter too much, he got lucky with price today.) We discuss a few details and he says he will bring the bike in, which he does. We go over the details, we will disassemble, he will take the frame and forks away to be resprayed (to a friend of his who does re-spraying), then bring them back to us as soon as he can so we can re-assemble it and service it. All good so far. I immediately go to work disassembling the bike, and give him a call to tell him it's ready. He comes to collect the frame and forks, pays for the entire job in advance and leaves us with the bits and pieces.  

The next day, someone else comes up to the door with his frame and forks (resprayed) and hands them to me telling me he has been sent to drop these off. I say thanks, and take them in. Before I start re-assembling his bike I inspect the paint job, which I am not impressed with at all, and then I notice a problem. On one of the tubes of the frame, there is an area about the size and shape of a pencil, that hasn't been painted properly. As in, I can still see the old colour underneath quite clearly. It looks stupid actually, and very very obvious once it's pointed out. This area is on the inside edge of the tubing by the back wheel, so you wouldn't necessarily see it easily when the bike was built up, but I did NOT want to build his bike up for him to want it re-sprayed when he noticed. I decided I had no choice but to phone him and just tell him about it before I did anything. The call goes like this;  

&gt; Me: Hi, you brought you bike for the frame to be sprayed blah blah blah  
Customer: Oh yeah, Hi. Did they bring the frame in?  
Me: Yes, but there's a potential problem in that there is an area on the frame that hasn't been painted properly, it's about the size and shape of a pencil on the inside edge of one of the tubes.  
Customer: What do you mean?  
Me: There is an area on the frame where you can still see the old colour and graphics showing through.  
Customer: What? Where? How bad is it?  
Me: It's on the inside edge of one of the tubes (chainstay) and it's quite noticeable once you see it. If I were you, I would definitely take it back and get them to spray over it. I just wanted to call you and tell you before I built it up so you could get it fixed.  
Customer: So what should I do? Is it really bad?  
Me: Look, I don't know whether it's going to bother you but if it was me, I would take it straight back. Why don't you come down and have a look at it?  
Customer: Ohhh, ermm... hmmm... This is annoying... Shall I phone them?  
Me: (laughing a little) If I were you, I wouldn't even do that. I'd just turn up with it and show them. Am I right in remembering that you said it's a friend of yours?  
Customer: Yes, a friend of mine works there. I'm going to phone them and see what they say.  
Me: Okay, well let us know what you want us to do, we will just wait to hear from you.  

*call ends*  

A few minutes later, the phone rings and I answer. The call goes like this;  

&gt;Me: Good afternoon (store intro) blah blah  
ASP: (Angry sounding person): I HEAR YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH A FRAME WE DID?  
Me: Oh, are you the people who sprayed the frame for Mr customer?  
ASP: YEAH, What's the problem you have with it?  
Me: We don't have a problem with it, I was just pointing out to the customer that the frame hasn't been sprayed properly a...  
ASP: What do you mean?!  
Me: ... Well, there's an area of the frame about the size and shape of a pencil that hasn't been sprayed over.  
ASP: Where? What do you mean, not sprayed over?  
Me: *Sigh* I can still see the old colour and graphics in a small area of the frame where the new paint hasn't been applied. I'm the guy who has to put this back together and I don't want to put it together only to be told to take it apart so it can be resprayed again.  
ASP: Well it's up to him isn't it. What does he want us to do?  
Me: I have no idea, I'm just waiting to be told what to do by Mr customer.  
ASP: Well if he wants us to do it again he will have to let us know won't he?  
Me: yeah?  

*call ends*  

The phone rings about 30 seconds after that last call ends, and this time it's the customer.  

&gt;Customer: Did they call you about the frame?  
Me: Yes I just spoke with them.  
Customer: What did they say?  
Me: They wanted to know where they haven't sprayed properly and what you want them to do about it.  
Customer: Shall I just get them to do it again?  
Me: I think you should come here and look at the frame so you can see exactly what I'm talking about, and decide from there.
Customer: Hmm, well you said it's quite bad. I'm going to call them again and get them to respray it.  

*call ends*  

So now I get to sit down and have a break from phone calls that go in circles, but my rest is rudely interrupted about half an hour later by a man who I had never seen before, barging into the store in a right huff and loudly exclaiming ""WHERE'S THIS FRAME YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THEN?"".  I get the frame and show him. On seeing the area I've been talking about all this time, he instantly changes attitude and calms down, saying ""Oh, yeah yeah, that's definitely not right, yeah that's our fault. We will sort that out no problem, sorry blah blah"". He takes the frame and leaves.  

*phone rings* (I wish that my glare had the power to silence that damn phone).  

&gt;Customer: Have they collected the frame?  
Me: Yes, they are going to respray it.  
Customer: What did they say?  
Me: They said it wasn't right, they will sort it out, and he took it away.  
Customer: Okay cool.  

*call ends*  

So the next day, the frame is dropped off by the paint man and he proudly shows that everything is fine now. I'm not sure if I'm meant to be impressed that it took them two attempts but, whatever. I take it in and start to re-assemble the bike. This is unfortunately where things go wrong.  

So, as I am assembling the bike, I realise there's another issue. I am about to put the sealed bearings in the headtube (where the forks go through the frame) and the bottom bracket (where the pedals go through the frame) but whoever sprayed the frame didn't mask ANYTHING off, so there is paint inside the tubes where the bearings drop into (headset) and actually press into with a bearing press in the case of the bottom bracket. With his particular bottom bracket standard, the shell of the frame and the bearings have a tolerance of 0.02mm. In other words, it's a very tight and precise fit. I decide to ring the customer because there is a high chance that the paint will flake off around these areas when I press the bearings in.  

&gt;Me: The guys who did your frame didn't mask off anything so there's paint inside all the tubes where we need to press the bearings back in, and the paint is almost definitely going to flake a little around these areas when I put them in.  
Customer: Why? What do you mean?  
Me: *explains in details*  
Customer: Okay, just do it and see what happens, I'll come and collect it tomorrow.  
Me: No problem.  

*call ends*  

So I press the bearings in and as expected a small amount of paint flakes off, but actually not as much as I was expecting. It's hardly noticeable. I then start to put all the other components back on and realise the following;  

The front chain rings and chain are are worn and ideally need replacing. The larger front chain ring is bent a little. The chain is too long. The rear cogs are worn out as well as rocking side to side on the part they are meant to be solidly attached to (which is also worn out and in need of replacing). The front derailleur (gear changer) is significantly bent and twisted. The gear cables are a bit rusty and not moving freely.  

I replace the gear cables and a few other minor parts, including shortening the chain (total is 20 something) and do the best I can with what he has. He comes back to collect the bike the next day and seems happy. I tell him I changed the gear cables etc and it's 20 something extra to pay. He doesn't mind this, and just as he is about to pay I start to question whether he is aware that a lot of parts are worn and in need of replacing? He says no very abruptly, and wants to know exactly which parts. I go to the bike and point out all the stuff that's wrong. He informs me that it's been running ""perfectly"" and he uses it every day. I tell him that we have done the best we can with it without spending too much, but he should be changing all these parts. He now wants to test the bike all of a sudden, so he leaves all his stuff on the counter and takes it outside. He rides it around briefly and comes back;  

&gt;Customer: The front gears won't change and the back ones are all over the place  
(At this point, my boss replies and decides to take over)  
Boss: Well, as Mr114 has pointed out to you, all of the gears are worn out and in need of replacing  
Customer: But it worked fine before?  
Boss: Well, bring it in and I'll have another look at it.  

We have another look, my boss tweaks a few things and gets him to try it. He rides around the front and comes back, 

&gt;Customer: It's no better. The gears aren't working properly. What's going on?   
Boss: There isn't much else we can do to it. It's all set correctly, but everything is worn.  
Customer: Well it worked fine before?  
Boss: It can't have worked fine before, look at the gears.  
Customer: Well you must have done something to it!?  
Boss: We haven't done anything to it, we've taken your bike apart and put it back together  
Customer: Well why isn't it working then? What have you done to it?  
Boss: Nothing! We haven't made your chain too long or bent your chain ring have we?  
Customer: Well I'm not having this. It worked fine before, now it doesn't work. I'm not happy, I'm not happy. What are you going to do about it?!  
Boss: Well I can look at it again and try and adjust it some more, I don't mind doing that at all, but we can only service what you bring in, and you've brought in a bike with lots of issues.  
Customer: You don't understand. It worked before, NOW IT DOESN'T.  

My boss adjusts the front gears a little more again and gives it back to him, the arguing continues.  

&gt;Boss: Try this now and see if your front gears will work.  
Customer: Well, they better work now because this is silly isn't it?  
Boss: The problem is, you're trying to make all these worn out parts run smoothly together and they just never will. No amount of adjustment is going to magically make it all like new.  
Customer: So what am I meant to do, just ride around a broken bike with gears that don't work? and you've got my money now?  
Boss: This has nothing to do with the work we have done. You've paid us to strip your bike down, re-build it and service it, but as I said before we can only service what you bring in.  
Customer: You don't get it. It worked perfectly before, I ride it every day and I could get every gear.  

They both start walking to the door so he can try it again  

&gt;Boss: Be careful when you change up on the front now because I've set it so the chain is getting very close to falling off the cog to try and get it to go up for you.  
Customer: *gets off the bike he just got on* Well I'm not going to ride it then am I if the chain is going to fall off?! Y'know what, fuck you.  
Boss: You can't take that to any bike shop in the country now in that state and get an improvement on what we've done there, unless you change parts.  
Customer: (now walking away from the shop with his bike) Fuck off you idiot  
Boss: Well don't come back because you're banned!  

At this point I reminded my boss that he still hadn't paid for the cables etc. He decided to call the customer later that day and ask him to pay for them. He refused of course, so we called the police. I can't remember the exact details but basically the police determined that it wasn't theft for whatever reason and wouldn't get involved. They advised a small claims court and it's just not worth us chasing him for it, so he got away with it unfortunately. At least it was only a small amount I guess.

simplygrace,“What does that mean?”,"I work in a pretty popular retail store for my area, and we close at 10:00 on weekdays. Prior to closing, we do two overhead announcements: one at 9:45 and one 10:00 telling customers to bring their items to the front so we can all leave.

It seems that we managed to get everyone out in a timely matter, so at 10:01 we do a quick sweep of the store to check for anymore stragglers that still need to be checked out. 

Everyone reports back over their radios that no one is left in the store so the last register at customer service and the last register at the main POS are closed down, all change is counted and any end of day reports are finalized.

As my coworker and I are emptying hangers into totes for transportation to the stockroom, a customer and her husband approach the register. 

Customer: “Which one is open?” 

Me (in a grim whisper to my coworker): “I just closed them all down.” 

Coworker: “Ma’am they’re all closed, we close at 10:00.” 

It’s now roughly 10:07.  The customer looks at her husband for a second and turns towards me.

Customer: “So what does that mean?” 

Me: “We cannot open another register as they’ve all been counted down... we made two announcements saying we were closing soon.” 

Customer: “But I thought you would just wait for me to check out.” 

Me: “No ma’am, we cannot wait for every person who comes to check out after we close.” 

In a fit of rage, she balls up all of her items and throws them on the floor, leaving her buggy behind as well. 

We offer to put them on hold for her so she can come back tomorrow and buy them, but to no avail. She angrily storms out, leaving us with her items that we all now have to put back before we can leave. Apparently her and her husband were in the men’s fitting rooms (which had originally been closed off by one of the apparel associates... meaning this lady had moved our barrier in order to get inside to use the fitting room), so when we did our sweep no one had thought to check the closed down fitting room... because it was closed down. 

Some people never cease to amaze me. ",TalesFromRetail,2733,1526151373
TheVenemousTwig,Customer is rude to me because she was over a week late to collect her order.,"FTP in here, on mobile and all that stuff.

This happened a few months ago but I've only just found this subreddit, even though it isnt that exciting I think it still belongs on here. Some parts I have summarised as this encounter took about 20mins with lots of unnecessary dialogue. Tl:dr at the bottom

I work for a large department store in the UK that offers a click and collect service and on this particular day a rude customer (RC) decided to come in 5 mins before we close to collect a package she had ordered.

Not an issue as this normally takes a couple of minutes tops. I was not there at the beginning but I came over to check once I heard RC saying very loudly: ""What do you mean you dont have my order!!"" at my coworker (C).

I came over to see if I could help while attempting to pacify RC a bit as all my coworkers are the nicest 5' something women you can meet and I am an overprotective 6'2"" dude so I hoped that my figure would get her to calm down a bit. Luckily that seemed to be her only outburst, not sure if it was because of me or not.

After checking RC had actually placed an order for our branch (she had) I asked C to check our back of house system which shows all the details of orders even if they arent for our store. This is the conversation that transpired afterwards:

RC: ""I'm sure you have my order as I checked in the [nearby town] branch and they told me that you had it for me in store""
Me: ""When did you check in the [nearby town] branch?""
RC: ""Around 2 weeks ago i guess""

Nearby town is a 10min drive away so why she didnt just come pick it up then is beyond me. C now gets back and tells me that the customer ordered the item over 3 weeks ago (we hold orders for 14 days before sending them back to the shipping center) which is why she wasnt showing up on the first system.

Me: ""Unfortunately we only hold your order for 2 weeks and therefore we have sent it back""
RC: ""WELL. This is just unnaceptable, nobody told me that you only keep the orders for 2 weeks""
Me: ""Actually ma'am it should say on your confirmation email that after 2 weeks we send the item back""
RC: ""But one of your staff was helping me process the order and shouldve told me that""
Me: ""I cant account for the staff but it says multiple times while you are placing the order and again on the confirmation email""
RC: ""Well in that case I want a full refund"" 
Me: ""I can assure you ma'am that a full refund is on its way, it is automatically processed when you dont collect your order""
RC: ""I want you to make absolutely certain that it is going through""
Me: (Internally: Oh for fucks sake) Externally: ""Of course, we can call someone to check. While we are doing that can you possibly check with your bank to see if the refund has already come through?""

At this point we are past closing time, she is the only person left in the shop and nobody can begin to cash up until she leaves. Wondering what the delay is, my manager (N) is on her way over and C is updating her on whats going down.

N proceeds to tell her everything I've just told her and gets C to call the customer service centre (CCS). After advising RC to check with her bank if the refund had come through she takes out her phone and... calls a friend to chat.

While RC is on the phone with her friend we get through to CCS and they ask for her name etc so they can get her order. While asking RC for this info she acts as though we are being very rude as she is on the phone and whispers the info to us very quietly so she doesnt interrupt her chat. Eventually we learn that as we predicted, a refund is on its way.

RC then just walked out the store, didnt say thank you, sorry or even goodbye. Just walked out while still chatting to her friend. Everyone has now been held back 15mins because she wouldn't take our word for it. Even my generally unfazed manager called her a bitch once she left.

Tl:dr Customer is over a week late for order and stops store from closing for 15-20mins until we check she is getting a refund and is rude the entire time about an issue that is entirely her fault",TalesFromRetail,973,1526116370
-AthenaTheWise,You’re in the wrong building,"I’ve been working in customer service for a few years now, and it never amazes me how dense the general population can be.

My current job is working front desk at a fitness center, and for the most part, clients are great. It’s also pretty quiet, and we don’t receive many walk-ins since our studio is on the second floor of the building and in a corner; it’s very easy to miss.

Me: Hi, how can I help you?

IFL: I’m here for a 4:00 appointment.

Me: *is looking at our scheduling calendar, which is pretty dead on Thursdays*
Me: Sorry, I don’t see you on here, do you know who you were supposed to see?

IFL: No

Me: Okay, do you know what you were here for? (we offer a few different things here)

IFL: *mumbles something about some kind of 40 pound fitness challenge*

Me: I’m sorry, I don’t have you on our schedule. Are you sure you’re in the right place?

IFL: *huffs* You are suite xxx right? 
And she also shows me her text reminder about her appointment... We don’t send out text reminders.

Me: Well yes... That is our suite, but... 

IFL: *cuts me off* Let me check my email...

So off she goes, checking out her email and she slowly walked out our doors. So I’m thinking great, she finally realized she’s in the wrong place. No apology of course. But oh no, she comes back. While I’m on the phone. So she has to wait a few minutes to speak with me again, which I know is making her upset, because remember, her appointment is at 4:00, and it was now around 4:10. 

Before I even get a chance to say anything, she turns her phone screen to me to show her appointment confirmation she had received via email, and points out that the email says suite xxx, which it does. So I then point out the rest of the address and show her our address on our business card... The two don’t match, which I point out to her. She gets super quiet, says “thank you” and walks out the door again.  No apology for being rude, acting like I was the idiot when she was in the wrong place, nothing. So she now has to drive to the correct address, and show up late to her appointment, and I can’t say I feel bad.",TalesFromRetail,1275,1525994932

I heard a bit of a hassle going on at a new cashier's register, so I stepped over to see what was going on.  The cashier was trying to find his bonus card account. Our default is to search by name, but he was insisting on using his phone number, which is possible but it  takes a few extra steps.  After a few tries we were not able to match his account with any of the phone numbers he provided.

IGNOREMETHATSFINETOO,"""This is a classy store.""","I seriously don't understand people most days. I work as a part time ASM for a hat store in the US. Part of our return policy (along with most other stores), is that you have to have a receipt to return the item and it can't be customized in any way. About a month ago a man comes in looking to return a hat he supposedly just bought the other day. He will be DA (for Dumb Ass), and I'll be myself.

DA: I'm here to return this hat.

Me: Okay, what's wrong with it?

DA: Nothing, I just changed my mind.

Me: Okay, do you have the receipt?

DA: No, my friend said this is a classy store and I shouldn't need the receipt. 

Me: I'm sorry sir, I can't do a return without the receipt. I can exchange it for you if you would like a different hat, but I can't give you any money back without it. 

DA: Well why not? This is supposed to be a classy store, I'm supposed to get better customer service than this.

Me: Again, it is our policy. I can't change it. I can't be sure that you bought it within our time frame, that the hat isn't stolen, or that you didn't get a discount on it. Without the receipt, there's nothing I can do.

DA: Well can I speak to the manager?

Me: I am the manager (first time I've ever said this and it gave me a huge rush)

DA: Well what about your boss?

Me: I'm sorry, she's not currently in right now, you're more than welcome to check back later in the week, but she's going to tell you the same thing. Corporate controls our policies. The only one who could even possibly bend the rules is maybe our District Manager, but she's on vacation.

DA: Well can you call her?

Me: No sir, I'm not going to bother my district manager for a return. The policy is clear, and I'm not risking my job for you.

DA: I can prove I bought it last week! There was two dyke (his words) looking women in here, and the white one rang me up.

I'd like to point out here, that there are only 3 people who work in my store. Me, my store manager, and another part time assistant manager. Only me and my store manager are white. So essentially, dumb ass called my store manager a dyke. The entire time I was exceedingly polite, but the moment he called my store manager a derogatory name, I became curt.

Me: I wasn't the one to ring you up, I don't recognize your face, I'm not giving you a refund. Now, we can do this one of two ways. Either you can leave my store and not come back, or I can have you arrested for trespassing and harassment, in which case, you'd be completely banned from the mall instead of just my store. Which one are you going to choose?

He stormed out cursing and yelling at me, saying he was going to get me fired for threatening him. I still have my job, didn't even get written up. When I told my store manager what he said, she went off. I don't think I've ever seen her so pissed off. As he walked off, I called out with the biggest grin I could muster ""Have a fantastic day!""

Flickerfire,The Only Time I Ever Walked Away From A Customer...And Got In Trouble For It.,"This happened a few years ago at my former job. 

It was a really busy summer day because it was just days before all the schools in town held their graduations, so I had a lot of people coming to stock up on supplies. We had a ton of balloon orders being reserved for the occasion, plus lots of weekend birthday parties being planned. Even with four people working up front, and my manager helping, we were still very swamped. My co\-worker, who was running the main register, took off for her lunch and that left me to take her place until she got back. My manager was in the back office taking an important phone call so she was not to be disturbed at that time and in natural fashion, my other colleague vanished into the warehouse because they didn't want to deal with the rush of people, so I was a sitting duck, running back and forth between the register and the balloon station to help the customers and it was getting irritating to say the least. I was exhausted and quickly developed a very bad mood about things. That was when the uppity bitch came in.

UB: I need to have an order of balloons done RIGHT NOW.

ME: Okay, I can meet you over at the balloon station.

UB: You're damn right, you will. \(wtf?\)

She goes over and grabs the colors she wants out of our dispenser.

UB: This is for a baby shower and I need them done NOW.

ME: Yes, ma'am. And what color string do you need for your balloons.

UB: You figure it out.

By now, my temper just flared. So I did her balloons the way I would have wanted them done. Halfway through the order...

UB: How much do these cost?""

I tell her our prices.

UB: That's too expensive. \(She could have asked that before I had started inflating the balloons, but I didn't peg her as being that smart.\) She goes over and grabs a bag of balloons off the wall.

UB: How much would these cost?

ME: They are the same price ma'am.

UB: But the bag is only $1.50.

ME: Yes, but the helium does cost to inflate.

UB: Are you sure these balloons in the bag are the same as the ones you're doing?

ME: Yes, I am 100 percent sure.

UB: Well, I don't believe you. You're a lying little bitch.

And that was what set me off. My co\-worker was back from her lunch. I turned to her.

ME: Okay, she's your problem now. And if you don't like it, ma'am, you can do your balloons yourself.

I walked off, leaving the her with her half\-finished balloon bouquet and took an early lunch. When I got back, my manager was fuming that I had left the bitchy woman standing there like that. Apparently, when I was gone, she devolved into a polite, shrinking violet who was just so confused as to why I had left. I sat down with my manager and explained my side of the story. The one who turned me in was my co\-worker, who was so flustered that she had to do the woman's order, and work the cash register at the same time, \(welcome to my world, honey\).

Two hours before closing a man (50s ish if I were to guess) walks up to the counter with 4 or so small items in his hand and I begin my spiel. 
(JM -Juggling man)

Me: ""Hello Sir, would you like a bag?"" As I begin scanning his items.

JM: ""What, do you think I'm going to juggle this?""

I'm about to laugh as I thought he was kidding up until this point.

JM: ""What kind of STUPID QUESTION IS THAT?"" he yells, actually shaking in anger, ""DO YOU EXPECT ME TO JUGGLE ALL OF THIS?! WHAT A STUPID QUESTION!""

Me: ""...No Sir I do not. I'm just supposed to ask, besides some people bring their own bags."" (And typically keep them on the floor where I cannot see)

JM: ""DOES IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE A BAG? WHAT KIND OF STUPID QUESTION..""

Me: ""...No Sir it does not."" As I finish scanning and bagging his items as he stares me down. I read out his total and he drops the cash on the counter and chucks the coinage at me. I ring him through with a ""Thank you, have a wonderful night!"" And slam the register shut. Next lady in line and I laugh about him after he leaves.


Sorry for offering you a bag I guess?",TalesFromRetail,1949,1525623479
misterasia555,Old lady get angry because she lost her receipt.,"So I worked for a pretty big retail store. We don’t usually have any clothes over 1K but some time we will have 3-4 items that are around that price. Our return policy is probably one of the easiest return policy you can possibly have. If you either have a price tags or a receipt we will accept your return 99% of the time the only difference is whether the money will go back to your credit card or the store gift card. The 1%  time we don’t accept return is when the item is really expensive and we have to make sure that  we don’t give the customer 1K for no reason . As a result, the return process is incredibly strict. We have make sure that they have the receipt and price tags a special tag that we put on expensive item, the return is within 30 days and that the items appearance matches with our descriptions on the system. 

So this lady bought two 1999.99 dollars handbag for some time and she came back wanting to return without receipt.  And here is the role IN: initial cashier, M: me. MA: manager L: Lady


L: “can I please return this? i know I don’t have the receipt but it’s 2 thousand dollars. I don’t want to lose it”

IN: I’m sorry mam, we can’t accept this item without a receipt.

L: please! It’s a lot of money and I don’t want to lose it

MA notices the conversation and offers to look up the receipt for her on the system.

MA: mam I can look up the Receipt for you if you tell me when you bought it and from what register if possible.

L: I don’t remember when I bought it, but I know it’s this month, and it’s not from this store but from another one from (another store of the same company but I can’t remember where) 

At this point, I knew this would be troublesome since the item was purchased not from our store specifically but from another store and we have no idea when she bought it.

So the manager nodded and went to her office to start looking. Now let me be clear, even if the customers remember the date, the searching process would still take about 15-30 minutes and this means during those time, we will be short one manager and the other one will have to handle the store by himself and that is why we don’t typically look for receipts unless it’s absolutely necessary.

It took her 3 full hours to find it, and during those time, the lady got extremely anxious and started acting extremely rude to us. She angrily saying things like “what take you guys so long to find a simple receipt? What can you guys do correctly? If you can’t find a simple receipt how will you hope to manage this store?” Of course at that point the one that is on the other end of the insult is me since the Initial cashier that rings her up already left cus her shift ended.

Conversation after the manager came back

L: Thank you so much Thank you thank you.

MA: you’re welcome mam Hope you remember to keep your receipt next time.

M(internally): fuck you, you were harassing us for like hours and now you are acting like this.

M to L: now mam can I.....

(She cut me off)

L: WHAT DO YOU WANT I HAVE THE RECIEPT RIGHT HERE CAN YOU NOT SEE IT? WHY ARE YOU SO SLOW?

M: mam I need to see the receipt to type the code in......

L: HERE TAKE IT

after punching in all the info and scan the item.

M: now can you.....

Lady interrupted me again

L: WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

M (calmly): can you insert the card that you used to buy the item with please?

L: OK FINE JEEZ HERE IT IS HAPPY?

At that point I just looked at her with a dumbfound expression . How can a person be like this I don’t understand.

We finished everything and she said that I should ask less question and just so my job next time (despite the fact that I never asked her a single question, simply telling her to give me the receipt and insert her cards in so she can get money back).

When she left the cashiers beside me and the manager both said something among the line of “well that’s rude” and the manager make sure to remember her face so she won’t do anything for her again.

But yeah without saying, I was in a super grumpy mood that day.

We sell bouquets that come in pre-wrapped in seasonal colors and different varieties of flowers. We also sell stems individually, but it's usually more expensive to buy them per stem. I had a middle-age man come in looking for a bouquet for his girlfriend. 

Man: I want this bouquet, but it doesn't have yellow roses. 
Me: I can add yellow roses, no problem. How many would you like? They are $1.99 each. 
Man: But that bouquet has yellow roses... ( he points to another bouquet that is the same price, but made up of different flowers). 
Me: Right, but this bouquet ( pointing to the one he intended to buy) has different flowers in it. They are the same price, but have different flowers in them. I can add yellow roses to your bouquet and remove some of the other flowers so it will still be $20.  
Man: No, I want the bouquet as is, but I want yellow roses. Can you just remove them from that bouquet without charging me? 
Me: No, I can't do that. I can add roses to your bouquet, that's no problem. But, I would still have to charge you. 
Man: Just take them out of that other bouquet. But the bouquet back in your case.  No one will know that one had roses in it.

composite_event,SHE DID IT FOR ME BEFORE,"Lady comes in, rude from the get-go. No greeting, just, ""I want [ custom matting, color ] and I want it while I wait.""

Now. There are some matting colors our shop carries in stock, but the turn around on an order is at least an hour, provided that nobody else comes to place an order. In addition, just because nobody is at the counter presently, it doesn't mean that there aren't *already* orders being worked on that are ahead of yours, because - - shocker-- someone came to order matting / framing / glass /canvas stretching ahead of you. 

I explain gently that I can't guarantee her order will be completed while she waits, as the average turnaround on what she wants is 48 hours when we have a workload like we do presently. 

""THE GIRL DID IT FOR ME LAST TIME!""

Yes, we sometimes do rush orders as a courtesy, when our order queue permits it, but unfortunately that is not the case at this time. 

""SHE DID IT LAST TIME AND I NEED IT TODAY"" 

I may be able to get it done by tomorrow morning, provided that no other guests come in this afternoon, but I can't guarantee it will be done while you wait. 

""THEN I'M GOING TO TAKE MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE!""

Okay..?

She looked intensely displeased with that answer. Perhaps she doesn't realize that I don't make commission on sales. Perhaps she thinks her 14$ would be too tantalizing to pass up, when stacked against the 1300$ already pulled in this morning. Either way, I just smiled and wished her good luck finding a place to do custom work on the cheap while she waits.

bloopscoopdiddlydoop,“I could have taken off with your entire store”,"I work at a small family owned import shop, which means there’s only ever one employee there at a time - we run with a skeleton crew, and there’s honestly not enough business for us to ever need more than one employee at a time. 

This means that if I need to use the bathroom, I have to leave the store unattended for the 1 minute and 30 seconds it takes me to go in the back bathroom and relieve myself. 

Today I get a pair of women who came in, of course, during the minute and a half I’m in the bathroom. They couldn’t have been in the store any longer than 45 seconds. I come out, give them the ol’ retail greeting, and one of them says in a super thick Long Island accent “we coulda taken off with your entire sto’h!” So I explain I’m here by myself all day, and being a human in a flesh prison, I occasionally have to attend to my bodily functions, and I apologize. It’s not like I can hold it for another 6 hours until the end of my shift, okay?

To top it all off, her and her cohort start telling me there’s no sales tax, they went somewhere else and were told it’s a “tax free day.” Uh, no, last time I checked, we get one tax free weekend in this state and it’s right before school starts so it only applies to school supplies and clothes for school.

Business guy will be BG, my manager will be AM, and I'll be ME.


BG-So I want to return this and it's been 31 days. I already went to your other store and they said they could only exchange it.


Ok, so you already know our policy and already didn't get your way at another store so now you're here to bitch to us. Great. 


ME- Yeah, our policy is 30 days on returns or exchanges so if the other store's manager was willing to still let you exchange it I would go back there to do that. 


BG-I have a business here and a personal account and this is horrible customer service. You guys won't make an exception for 1 day. 


ME-Well you did have the extended period for being a business customer. Our system locks us out after the return period so we can't return it.


BG-Let me talk to your manager!


I go try to talk to my manager who is busy helping my coworker with another customer. I explain how he didn't even buy the product at our location and wants to return it after the return period. My manager is really cool about things and tells me to offer an exchange, but don't give any money back, even if the new product costs less.


I go and explain this to BG but he isn't having it.


BG-Why can't your manager come and tell me that himself? Why does it have to go through you? 


ME-Well as you can see RIGHT THERE, he is helping another customer out. You can wait on him but it's going to be a while. 

BG- This is absolutely ridiculous? 


Thankfully my manager steps in and takes over because I'm about to lose it.


AM-So what's the problem?


BG-Your customer service here is terrible. 


AM-Yep.

BG just stands there in disbelief. I can see my manager is wanting to cuss this guy out but he's thinking about getting yelled at from 3 levels up about losing a business account. 


AM-You know what, I'll make an exception this one time and return it for you. Remember your return period next time. 


AN starts to process the return. BG starts looking more angry. 


BG-Well I don't even want the return of you aren't going to do it with a smile on your face!

SkullStar,"Sorry lady, we don’t refund your lost items","At work, I’m usually in two departments.  The Jewelry counter being one of them.    

As Mother’s Day approaches, it starts to get busier.  It doesn’t help when the phones start ringing with customers looking for stuff.    

When the phone rang yesterday I thought it would be just another person inquiring about our selection.    

Unfortunately I was met with hysterical crying.   The customer on the line proceeded to tell me a long story about how she’s been coming into the store everyday for the past couple of days and spending a lot of money.    

She said she bought a ring in Jewelry on Monday and when she came in on Tuesday, she lost it in the store.  According to her logic, we owed her money because she left the ring in the store.   

When I explained it was her property after she purchased it, she began to scream at me and tell me I didn’t know how laws worked.  She said she couldn’t believe we would steal from her after she gave us all her money.    

At this point I put her on hold and called a manager. The moment the manager picked up the phone the screaming continued, to the point where the customer threatened to call the police.     

The manager backed me up and told the customer the same thing, we can’t give her a refund for something she lost.  Adding to that, the manager asked for the customers name and number just Incase we found the ring anywhere.    The customer said she felt uncomfortable with store employees knowing who she was and requested corporates number instead.  The manager gave it to her and hung up the phone.

EliBloodthirst,We're mo longer serving,"on mobile as usual and the story occured last sunday

In England we have a law where a store can only be trading for 6 hours a day, usually speaking it's 10-4 or 11-5. My particular store works by a 11-5 basis, this has been around for years and is made very clear. We have just had an incredibly busy day but the overhead announcement has been made that the store had just closed.

I was just logging off the self checkouts to begin my after store duties when i see some girls sneak into the store to buy some items, usually speaking we get a build up for 10 minutes after the store shuts of customers but once the door shuts no one new is allowed in, this is law.

M is me, g is girl. Others spoke but it was same hat as the main girl.

M: I'm sorry girls the store is shut, you shouldn't be in here, how did you even get past the door
G: I walked in, the door was open
I know for a fact it wasn't as the guy locking the door had it on one way (and he was even present), they must have sneaked in whilst someone walked out.
M: The doors are on one way, anyone in is en route to paying or leaving. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
G: the doors were open w just want one thing.
They trashed some sandwiches n drinks ""looking"", honestly had no regard for the store. They only had one thing coming.
I walked away from them leaving em at it before spotting my saviour, one of the dudes from security mentioning ever so nonchalantly.
M: Got some girls trashing sandwiches and came in after hours, do what you do best man.

He kicked them out so fast with them kicking and screaming , I have no regrets and I thank the security bro for apprehending the law.

MattieMallow,You need to swipe my ID for alcohol? That's ILLEGAL!,"Hey guys, first time posting to this sub. This story takes place earlier this year at a grocery store I used to work at. I was a cashier working until close with one bagger to help me. No big deal, it was late in the evening and the store was dead. All was well, until this early 30s man comes through with his small armful of groceries, including a bottle of wine. Now at this store, we had a policy where if the customer appears to be under 40 years old, we must card them. This dude definitely looked under 40 but over 21. ""M"" will be me, and ""SAM"" will be smart-ass man. 

M: Ok sir, I'm just going to have to swipe your ID your real quick. 

SAM proceeds to flip open his wallet FBI style for me to see before putting it back in his pocket. 

M: I'm sorry but you're going to have to let me swipe it in my register. I'm not allowed to just look at it. 

SAM: What do you mean? No I don't! State law (FL) doesn't require me to do that. 

M: hoping to laugh it off ""haha sir well I guess they don't trust our [the cashier's] eyes alone here.

SAM: No, lord knows what information that machine takes off my ID. I don't have to let you swipe it. I read that it was illegal in the state of Florida. 

Now at this point the bagger and I are in disbelief, we both exchange a look like ""wtf is going on""

M: I can guarantee you its not. It's definitely lawful. Every (store name) does it, and it's how they train us to ID. Where did you read that? 

SAM: I read it on Facebook. 

He actually admits that. He goes on for a little bit longer about the article and his right to privacy etc. I tell him,

M: I don't think a Facebook article is an accurate source of information. If you don't allow me to swipe a valid form of ID, I can't sell you this wine. 

Hes becoming very annoyed at this point. In a way that is even mildly aggressive, he takes out his wallet again and puts it closer to my face, pointing at a card in abouther window pocket beside his drivers license. 

SAM: LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS A CONCEALED WEAPONS PERMIT. YOU CAN'T GET ONE OF THESE UNLESS YOU'RE OVER 21. 

boi. At this point I'm actually a little afraid. I'm just a college kid. I've never dealt with anything like the before. It blew my mind how this man could be so ignorant as to how the law works. 

M: hey man I can't accept that permit as an ID, I don't know anything about concealed carry permits. It's not allowed. Go to my manager at the service desk. I'm not selling this to you unless I can swipe your drivers license. 

Something must've clicked in this dumb dude, maybe it was the caution in my voice or the obvious fact he just scared this two kids working at a grocery store, because he mutters ""whatever, here""  and hands me his ID. I swipe it and we finish the transaction quickly. 

When he leaves, my coworker and I couldn't stop talking about it. We must've told every other person in the frond end of the store that night. It made no sense why that guy put up so much fight over nothing, and actually thought I would accept him showing me his permit as a valid ID. 

For those who don't know, valid ID in Florida for alcohol purchase are only Drivers License, State issued ID card, military ID, or passport. Even if we can't swipe the ID because it's damaged, we can type the DOB into the register when it's in our hand. But only if swiping the card first fails. 

Hope you enjoyed. I have plenty more interesting stories from my time in retail. I hope to post more in the future.

SufficientlyAwkward,I WANT TO USE MY COUPON!,"Hey everyone! I haven’t posted in a while, but I’m back with another crazy customer story from the women’s clothing store. *insert obligatory mobile post statement here*

So I’m still the manager of a women’s clothing store, but our store also sells intimates (bras, panties, etc.). Our company recently sent our rewards members a coupon to get one bra for $25. This coupon is only good on regular price bras, as we have promotional bras and clearance bras as well. However, the promotional and clearance bras are always $25 or less anyway, so it wouldn’t make sense to try to use the coupon on those. Or so I thought.

This ordeal happened on Saturday. I’m Me, and the customer is Crazy Lady (CL).

Me: Hi, welcome to Women’s Clothing Store! What can I help you find today?
CL: I have a coupon for a discounted bra.
Me: Great! 

*walks CL to bras*

Me: You can use that coupon on any of the regular price bras here. If you don’t see your size, let me know, and I’ll check to see if we have that style with our back stock.
CL: What about these bras here? *motions to promo bras*
Me: Those bras are already on sale for $25 or less, so the coupon doesn’t apply to those. 
CL: Okay, thank you.

I leave her to shop and go assist some other customers on the floor. I get called to the registers to do a return, and after the return there was a line, so I began to ring some customers to help my associate. We’re almost through the line when Crazy Lady comes up to the counter with three bras.

Me: Hi again! It looks like we found some cute bras for you today! 
CL: Yes! And I want to use my coupon on all of them.
Me: Well unfortunately the coupon can only be used on one bra, but it looks like all of the bras you pick out are promotional bras anyway.
CL: So what? I want to use my coupon.
Me: The promotional bras you’ve picked are already $25 or less. Would you like me to help you find a regular price bra so we can use your coupon?
CL: NO. I already picked out the bras I want. Use my coupon on all of them.
Me: Ma’am, the coupon allows you to get one bra for $25. All of these bras are already $25 or less-
CL: I DON’T CARE, I WANT TO USE MY COUPON. JUST USE MY COUPON ALREADY.
Me (still calm and smiling): What exactly would you like me to do with the coupon?
CL: Give me my bras for $25!!!!
Me: Okay.

I take the coupon, act as though I’m keying it in, and just scan the bras as they are. Two were $25, one was $20. 

Me: Alright, your total is $70 plus tax.
CL: WHAT?! DID YOU USE THE COUPON LIKE I SAID?!?
Me: Yes ma’am. 
CL: This can’t be correct! You’re incompetent. Where’s your manager?
Me: Ma’am, I am the manager, and I’m far from incompetent. Would you like to remove one of the bras from your purchase?
CL: NO. I WANT TO PAY $25!
Me: Wait. You want to get three bras for $25??
CL: YES. They let me do that at Competitor!
Me: Well that’s not happening here. The coupon clearly states one bra for $25. If you want all three bras, it’s $70 plus tax. Otherwise, you might want to go back to Competitor, even though I can tell you they won’t sell you three bras for $25 either.
CL: GIVE ME BACK MY COUPON. I’M LEAVING AND NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN!

I hand her the coupon and she storms out in a huff. The next customer in line comes up to the counter laughing. 

Me: Sorry for the wait. 
Laughing customer: I’m sorry you had to deal with that horrible woman. I have a question though. *barely containing herself*
Me: Sure, what’s up?
LC: If she’s never going to shop here again, why did she need the coupon back? *bursts into giggles*

Customer: Yeah. (Yells something to his wife in what I am guessing is Hindi, including the word “quickly.”)

yeahnonoteven,He just wanted a #5,"I work at a small locally owned deli. Today, this old guy comes in and wanted to order a sandwich. I am Me, he is Him. 

I tell the dude to fill out the order form and I'll make his sammy for him. 
Him: ‘I JUST WANT A #5!'
Me: ‘The order form is right here, sir' 
Him: ‘I JUST WANT A #5!'
Me: ‘You still gotta fill out the form, sir'

kmooey,Devil woman and the birthday girl.,"(Apologies Mobile formatting)

I work at a deli at a company run supermarket. Employees at our store make the most of retail hell, we have strong morale because we joke around with each other and customers as well. Our staff are supportive and have each others backs.  Our demographic are mostly regulars we see everyday and a handful of crazy.

Anyway it was my birthday a couple of days ago, I chose to work the day as im in my 30s so im happy to celebrate after work, no biggie. So I'm doing my thing in the deli usual thing, when i get the most ridiculous birthday PA from let's say Sam one of  the other departments. 

Sam ""We'd like to wish our junior Kmooey a sweet 16, sweet 16 never been kissed, she is one of our juniors in the deli departmeny, just training, timid and shy so make sure you go down to the deli and wish our Kmooey a happy birthday""
 it went something like that but much more hilarious. 

Anyway the whole time this announcements going on everyone is laughing and im super embarrassed, hot in the face and laughing. Im chuffed they made an effort. A couple of regulars came up afterwards and wished me a happy birthday and teased me if ive been kissed lately.

But this would not be a worthy story with out devil woman. Straight after the announcement DW storms up to the deli counter with a face scowl like a dogs bum. Looks at me, looks at my name tag.

DW ""well he carried on""

Me "" haha well hes a great guy, hes priceless"" 
Thinking that she was relating to my embassment.

DW ""geeeeeze (eyeroll) who HONESTLY cares"".

I stood back with an 'Are you serious?!?' look on my face and stared at here for a while. I was amused at the Audacity! She is speaking to the birthday girl. What a devil woman. 

I stepped back into customer service mode and asked her how I could help. She lists off this out of the way order for 'freshly' shaven processed meat that we have already prepared shaven in the case. 

My coworker steps in ""Oh we are out of stock with that product thats what we have left"" 
(I'd usually be happy to freshly shave a product but I would have the same response at this point) 
DW ""well I guess you can't help me"" storms off.

Staff wished me a happy birthday throughout the day and how funny Sam was on the PA. I brought up how the customer DW reacted, everyone thought her crazy reaction was hilarious and how horrible her existence must be.

biffybeefa,We Should Have Computers That Track The Clothes Position All Around The Shop,"This happened about a month or so ago.

I work in a fairly busy department store. It's really popular with cheap prices so we get all sorts in there, some lovely people and some that treat you like dirt.

The staff womens changing room and computer sign\-in is at the back of the shop, so we've to walk through the shop to get to the stock room, where our managers tell us where we are assigned for the day. We usually make a beeline straight for the stock room because if we get stopped by somebody we'll be marked late.

So, this day I was walking along to the stock room, just in front of the doors, when I hear this woman shouting behind me, ""Come here...I said come here, where are you going? Get over here now"". I wandered into the stock room, figuring by the tone of voice that it was somebody talking to somebody they knew. I walk up to my manager and hear a woman behind me at the stock room doors, ""What are you doing? I said get over here"" she shouts, at me, and motioning at me to go over to her, pointing at her feet. At this point I'm in a state of shock and look to my manager. My manager looks at me, and I guess figured I've no idea what is going on by my reaction, and wanders out to the woman and I hear her complaining about me to my manager, ""I'm so sorry I wasn't talking to you, she left and completely ignored me"".

My manager comes in, I'm freaking that I've actually gotten a complaint, and she asks me to check a coat for the customer. Of course this coat is reduced so the only ones left are the ones left on the floor, so I get the happy job of telling the woman.

I head out to her, where she is chatting to her husband and giving out about me with her back turned to me. I try and explain that the coat is reduced and the only sizes left are the ones on the rail.

""Okay...so check the computer"".

""Well see it's reduced so it's only shown as reduced on the computer, it's cleared from the stock room"".

""Not that computer, the computer that keeps track of where the clothes are in the shop""...she gets annoyed by my reaction, ""the computer that'll say this coat has been picked up and left in the home department or the accessories department"". 

She actually thought we have tags on clothes that monitor where they are in the shop at all times and if they've been moved from their department. I had to explain that we didn't have that, got a dirty look and she walked off giving out. Luckily my manager thought she was horrible and was on my side about it. Honestly thought I'd be lectured about apparently ignoring a customer.

TL;DR: shouted at and ordered by a customer I didn't realise was talking to me. Proceeds to complain about me to my manager. Thinks we track clothes around the shop.",TalesFromRetail,1680,1524952996
finallyinfinite,Can I get it anyway?,"Yesterday while I was at work, I was helping a customer pick out some items and letting her know what the promos were while she picked everything out.  After a few minutes she's done and we go to my register so I can ring her out.  

As I start ringing her out, the following conversation happens (Me for me, C for Customer, MOD for my manager on duty, and GM for my general manager)

C: can I get a discount on this?

Me (confused what she's asking for): well, you're getting the promos on these.  So these will be buy one get one free, and those will be three for $12.  

So I continue ringing her and a couple seconds later she keeps at it.

C: can I get a military discount?

Me: are you active duty?

(No one ever is, and I feel bad denying people who aren't, but I don't have a choice because it's a policy that goes higher than my store)

C: no

Me: I'm sorry, we only offer military discount to active duty.

C: do you give it to law enforcement?

Now this one I'm not sure of, so I ask my manager on duty.

MOD: do you have an ID for it or a badge on you?

C: no, I'm civilian today.

MOD: okay, we do need some kind badge or ID to be able to apply the discount.

C: Can I get it anyways?  I've accomplished so much in my life.

MOD: we need proof of enlistment and status, so if you have your badge or something.

I don't remember saying much to her from there, unsure how to respond.  Like.  We've told her this is how it works, you don't meet the criteria.  What else am I supposed to say?  The matter seems pretty settled but I guess not.

I go to total her out and 

C: so do I get the discount or not?

At this point, since my MOD didn't know if we even offer it to law enforcement, and I wasn't comfortable making the call to give a discount I wasn't sure about, I got in contact with my GM, explaining the situation and asking if I should just give it to her anyways since it's becoming a customer service issue.  He said yeah go for it.  So I went back out to finish her transaction.

Me: okay, so I spoke to my GM and was given permission to give you the discount today.  In the future, we do require a badge or ID for proof, but this time I can give it to you.

After the whole thing was over I asked my GM if the military discount is extended to law enforcement.  Turns out it isn't. 

But at least the customer was happy.

Edit: It's early as I typed this, and I forgot some details and had to edit it within 3 minutes. Nice.",TalesFromRetail,1179,1524921295
LBS22,How dare you charge me full price for a new item,"Hello all, it's me back with stories from the never ending saga of the local bike shop I work at and the champions of logic that frequent our store.  

Enter Difficult Human (DH), and let me give you some background on him.  He is a convicted time burglar and will come once every month or two with a notepad and ask endless questions about every single bmx bike that we have, claim he will be right back to buy a bike, and then wont come back for a month or two to repeat the cycle.  Its gotten so bad that whenever my coworker and I see him walking up we scramble to appear busy or absent so that the other one has to help him.  Imagine a reverse version of musical chairs.  

So DH comes in and my coworker picks up a phone that has nobody on the other end of the line and makes up a conversation so DH will come and make me help him (well played, coworker).  So after being betrayed by my coworker, DH and I go into the bikeroom and he begins the process of asking me every possible question about the bikes.  An hour goes by and then DH does something he never does; he asks to ride one of the bikes. It's a beautiful bike with gray tires and I had just built it up out of the box the night before, so it was less than a day old and had only been ridden about 200 ft during my test ride around the shop.  

I was so excited so I pull the bike down, tell him to go ride around the parking lot and then come back.  After a few minutes he comes back in and this is how the interaction goes

DH: ""I love this bike man. I'm going to take it, how much is it gonna set me back?""

Me: ""Glad to hear that man!  That one is $450."" 
*Now please buy it and take you and your notepad out of here and spare me*

DH: ""Okay so how much do you guys take off for the bike being dirty?""

Me: ""Its not?  That bike is less than 24 hours old you and I are the only ones who have even been on it.""

So he points down at the gray tires which now have a faint black smudge along the middle from being on the pavement.

DH: ""No look at the tires they're filthy.  I'm not going to pay full price for a used bike.""

I look at him and start to smile and call his bluff, but I'm slammed with the realization that he is actually being completely serious.

Me:  ""Sir I can wipe the tires for you but I'm not giving you a discount on a brand new bike because you took it for a test ride and got it a little dirty.""

DH: ""I cant believe this.  You really are going to charge me the price of a new bike for a used one?""

Me: ""This is a new bike, SIR."" *teeth grit*

DH: ""I am so in shock right now.  If this is how you guys treat loyal customers then I dont even want to buy this bike from you.""
*not a loyal customer, a thief of time and joy*

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, but I am treating you fairly I just cant give you the discount.""

DH: ""Well then you lost out on my business and I will never buy anything from you again, this is so unfair to me and I will never come back in here.  
*he had never purchased anything, ever.*

And as mysteriously as he came, he went, and he never came back.  Some say hes still out there with his notepad, asking questions that nobody knows the answers to and rightfully shouldn't.

JammyThing,Excuse me madam but you appear to be semi-naked in our warehouse.,"We have notices on the doors separating our warehouse from the shop floor which state that the area is off limits to anyone other than staff, though it is phrased a bit more politely than that. Yet there are still a number of people who just ignore this. We have had customers walking around the warehouse because they A, can't seem to find someone to talk to on shop floor, B, decided to check our inventory for themselves and even C, just wanted to see if there was anything interesting. This one however, this was the strangest. 

Myself and a couple of work colleagues were in warehouse talking about whatever jobs needed doing during the day when the warehouse door opens and a woman walks in, stands next to some pallets and starts removing her clothing. Now where we were stood I was the only facing the woman, the other two were stood facing towards me and hadn't noticed until they saw my expression and turned to see what I was looking at. At this point we all sort of stared at each other, wondering what was going on. 

I decided to cautiously walk up to the woman and talk to her.

Me:- Excuse me but what are doing?

Woman:- *Stares at me with a dead pan expression while in her underwear* I'm trying this dress on.

At point I should mention that although we are generally a grocery store  we do sometimes sell clothing most of which comes in boxes so you can't really try it on in store. 

Me:- Well I'm sorry but you can't do that here, this is a warehouse.

Woman:- Well you don't have changing rooms so how am I supposed to see if something fits if I can't try it on, hmmm?

Me:- Look, just because we don't have changing rooms doesn't mean you can come in here to get changed! If you buy it and it doesn't fit and you return it we'll happily either give you another size or give you, your money back. So can you please put your clothes back on and leave?

At this point the woman tutted at me, rolled her eyes, got dressed and left the warehouse, finally. I don't think shes been back since, maybe shes out there somewhere in the wild, randomly stripping in places she shouldn't. ",TalesFromRetail,1140,1524869821
emoguyrnlol,“She obviously has never owned her own business before”,"I work at a retail store. These past few days, so many people have been quitting. The normal thing is to put your two weeks in right? Well these employees put their two weeks in and then stopped showing up to finish their two weeks. It’s been making me really depressed that my favorite co workers are leaving. And on top of being depressed, I’m stressed out because these people were still scheduled but aren’t showing up so the entire workload is all on me. But whatever. I’ll just pile my emotions like I always do.  

Well yesterday this customer came in. He wanted to see our jewelry which is locked away. I’m the gatekeeper so I went to show him the jewelry. 

“Can I see shsjxozjxhbd”

“I’m sorry which one?”

“That one???? The only one of that kind that’s in there????”

He mumbled, so I didn’t hear what he said he wanted to see, so I asked him to repeat which one. He got so unbelievably rude and condescending just because I didn’t hear which one he wanted to see. Not even 5 minutes into helping this guy he’s already awful. Whatever I’m used to it. Just keep piling on more reasons for me to want to shoot myself. 

Then he asks me “what size are those rings?”

“I don’t know off the top of my head let me pull them out and check”

I start pulling them out one by one and he snaps at me. “I didn’t say take them out and show them to me I said what size are they??????” Again, condescending tone.  Rude. Awful. I want to stab him at this point.  But whatever.  I’m used to it. Just keep piling on even more reasons for me to want to shoot myself.  

I finally finish with him. He wants the rings so I bring them to the front to hold them until he’s ready to check out. 

Like 40 minutes later he comes up and I check him out. I just want this dude gone so I don’t say anything at all. I scan his items, he pays, I hand him his bag and say here you go. That’s it. He doesn’t deserve a thank you or come again or have a nice day. He’s cancer. 

He was really mad that I didn’t say thank you have a nice day. 

“*scoffs.* *here you go.* You don’t thank your customers when they’re done????”

I’m so sick of this guy’s input. The piling of stress finally collapsed and I snapped. 

“No dude. I’m not going to be polite to someone who’s so condescending and awful towards me okay??”

“Uhhhh what????????? I’m awful?????”

“Oh it’s not awful of you to scream at me at the jewelry case for not understanding what you said?”

“I didn’t do any of that??? You asked me which one so I said the only one that’s there” 

“Yeah you said it as if I’m a moron for asking you to repeat which one it is”

“Maybe if you took that stupid thing out of your ear you would’ve heard me?” (Referring to my headset to communicate with my manager and associates)

“Oh but you’re not being rude?”

Then he chimes in with my all time favorite line from customers. 

“Where’s your manager? The customer is always right”

Me being a brat, I ask my manager over the headset “is the customer always right?”

She scoffs and says no. 

“My manager said no the customer isn’t always right”

“They’ve clearly never owned their own business then”

“So you’re telling me at your business, a 20 dollar transaction warrants the customer to treat your employees like garbage? I can see why you’re shopping at a discount store your business must be failing”

“Psh. And you wonder why you’re working at a retail store”

I work in the Meat &amp; Seafood department of a large grocery store chain, and some of my duties include helping customers at the service counter; where we serve various steaks, chicken, fresh fish, and other seafood like shrimp.

This particular customer simply asked for a pound of a certain. Shrimp. I quickly turn around to throw on a pair of single use gloves and grab a bag to put her shrimp in. As I turn around I see her arm reaching over the glass flicking individual shrimp aside WITH HER BARE HAND. 

I immediately ask her what she's doing and to please stop because she's contaminating the rest of the shrimp by touching them. The customer will be C, and I will be Me.

C: Oh I don't want those ones in my bag they look bad.

Me: ok well you can just tell me not to grab those ones, but please don't touch them yourself as that's not ok.

Manmadeking,"""There's no public restroom.""","My convenience store is part of a popular chain but the thing is the building itself was built in 1948 which means we don't have the same space to work with as our other stores in the area. The biggest gripe is we don't have a public restroom but it use to be that if a customer asked kindly we'd let you use the restroom we do have since it's easy enough to get into. After a few customers decided to abuse this (had a few leave needles behind, another buy alcohol and for some reason chug it in the restroom before leaving) it came to pass that only people who would need it for an emergency, little children and pregnant women for example, were allowed in there.  That's the backstory.


It's graveyard and I'm working alone, making small talk with a regular (a nice old man who wakes up too early) while I clean up, when a woman bursts through the door asking where my bathroom is. I tell her there isn't a public restroom and begin to tell her about the one at the store across the street but she interrupts me.


&gt;Woman: You really have no toilet? I gotta go!


She asks (yells) this too loud for 3am, ruining the nice quiet of the store. I tell her there's no public restroom and try to tell her about the store across the street again. She interrupts again.


&gt;Woman: Well then where the fuck do you go?


I don't answer that question because that's a silly argument to begin. I tell her about the store across the street. She returns with that she tried over there but the bathroom is closed. Her car was never in their parking lot because I have eyes. She came off the road into my lot but I'm not going to question her because that's another silly argument to begin. I instead tell her that just down the road maybe two minutes away is a big grocery store open 24/7 with a restroom.


&gt;Woman: I'm not from the area, I don't know where the hell (other store name) is! Where do you go? Outside like a fucking animal?


&gt;Me: (other store name) is literally a minute east from here, just down the road here. I have no public restroom you can use.


&gt;Woman: I bet if I pissed outside you'd call the cops on me-


&gt;Me: (other store name), down the road, that way, has a restroom you can use.

I watch her begin to pee in my parking lot and that's when my regular starts laughing, apologizing for me having to put up with people like that, and I just sigh. By the time she leaves I have a bucket of hot water filled to dump on her pee puddle and the info my manager will want.

I was ringing out another customer and heard her making a fuss about the price on a hat to my coworker. I always give my associates some time to handle things on their own and only step in when there's a problem so I just watched the situation and let her handle it.  

Then the woman came up to the check out. I was still with the same customer so I called my coworker up to ring out her purchase. I finish up my customers transaction and turned to the counter to do some markdowns and made sure to listen to their interaction, as she always causes some sort of trouble. The lady's total came to $28 and some change. She paid in cash, I heard the register shut, and this is where the trouble began. C is Coworker and CL is Crazy Lady.  

C: ""Your change is $3. Thank you!""  

CL: ""No, I gave you two $20 notes. You gave me the wrong change.""  

C: ""Are you sure? I thought it was a 20 and a 10 but let me call my manag-""  

CL: ""I gave you two $20 notes. Do not lie.""  

At this point C turns to me with an expression that I could just tell she needed to take a breather. So I walked to the register.  

M: ""Sorry about that, ma'am. I just have to count the register to verify we gave you the wrong amount.""  

So at this point I print out the report that tells us how much money is in the drawer. I was a little worried because mistakes happen and sometimes the registers are a little short/over but this day it was exactly right, down to the penny.  

M: ""So it looks like our register is exactly right. I'm sorry about that, maybe you gave us the wrong bill by mistake?""  

CL: ""No. My son always gives me the same amount of notes everytime I come here. He gives me 5 $20 notes. No $10 notes ever.""  

M: ""Well I'm sorry ma'am but our register is showing that we have the right amount. If you gave us two $20's then it would show we were $13 over. Could you have gone to another store and they gave you a $10?""  

CL: ""No. I came here first. My son always gives me 5 $20 notes. No $10 notes ever.""  

M: ""I'm sorry about that ma'am but I can't give you any money from the drawer, as it's showing we have the right amount and then our drawer would be short at the end of the night.""  

CL: ""This is unacceptable. I shop here all the time and I use cash everytime. My son always gives me 5 $20 notes. No $10 notes ever.""  

At this point I was getting annoyed and was tired of hearing about how much money her son gives her, as I had heard that story far too many times by this point so I took the calculator and the slip of paper that shows the amount of money we should have and put them in front of her.  

M: ""This slip of paper shows how much money should be in the register. It's the same number that we have in, see? If you gave us 2 $20's then this number *pointing to calculator* would be $13 more than it actually is.""  

CL: ""This is disappointing. I shop here all the time. My son always gives me 5-""  

M: ""Ma'am I'm really sorry about that but my registers correct so the only other thing I can do is wait until the store manager gets in and have her look at the cameras.""  

CL: ""Oh no, don't do that. It's fine. Must have just been a mistake.""  

At this point she takes her items and leave. I needed a smoke break after that.  

Tl;dr: Lady accuses us of short changing her. Backs off once I bring up looking at the cameras. ",TalesFromRetail,2250,1524638179
Instinctzop,Ma’am I’m Closed!,"I work in the dairy department of my grocery store, unfortunately before I started working here I was in the front end of my store. That being said I’m trained to cashier and my job takes FULL advantage of that. Meaning I get to dedicate about 1/4th of my shift everyday to cashiering while still being expected to get everything else done in my department because ya know it helps save payroll! Anyway I get called up front to help check and it’s been about twenty minutes but I really need to get back to my department because whenever I leave hell freezes over back there. I turn off my register light, put up a closed sign, and tell every customer that I’m closed after a certain point. This lady gets in my line and I say “ma’am I’m closed, I’m sorry but you’re going to have to go to another register”. No response, okay maybe she didn’t hear me. I noticed she’s wearing headphones, so I proceed to say it 3 more times with hand gestures and pointing at the closed sign and she continues to ignore me. So I did the natural thing and walked away right when she was the next customer in line.

Apparently, when people came to shop, some didn't know this and this is how this story came to be. Me = me and BL = bakery lady 

BL: (comes over to me while I'm on register) Hi, where's your icing and cake decorating stuff?

Me: Oh, it's right behind you in aisle 1. It should all be right in the middle against the left side wall.

BL: Great, thanks. Can I just bring it there to have someone decorate a cake for me? 

Me: We actually don't have a bakery but we do have all of the icing stuff and there are cakes right past the fruit in a refrigerator if you'd wanna pick one of those out for a birthday or something. 

BL: (going from totally normal customer to irritated) What do you mean you don't have a bakery? 

Me: Yeah, I guess they never put one in. We're actually the only store for this chain in all of [State]. But like I said, we've got all the stuff you'd need to decorate a cake you'll just have to do it yourself unfortunately. 

BL: I can't believe you don't have a bakery! Me: Well, I can't really help you on the bakery thing unless you go to another store. 

BL: No bakery! You know, you're a little bitch! (walks off) 

Me: Oh okay, cool.

Certified_GSD,"""Well, it's considered. Goodbye now.""","Currently working the front register for a small family business to pay off that wonderful student debt. I've got a collection of stories saved up that I'm finally getting around to typing out. We're a local deli/grocery cornerstore.

Not as many selections like a big chain grocer, but moreso than a gas station/convenience store; plus, we have choice meats, thick steaks, and other things you'd expect a meat counter to have. It's more expensive than what you could get at a big chain ($13.99/ LB. Strip Steaks and Ribeyes over Big Chain's $7.99/ LB., $5.99/ LB. for hamburger over $1.99/ LB.), but it sure is a helluva lot better in quality since we still cut the damn things ourselves and make 'burger from chuck and steak scraps.




In this particular tale, my boss (she is also part-owner) was going over new policies (can't remember what though) with me at the register when a customer came in to buy a newspaper. A lot of people who buy them typically just buy the paper and leave, and since we only make a dime off each of 'em, we always try to make them buy something else too.

This guy tells my boss that
&gt; Y'all should really put the newspapers by the door. People don't even know that y'all sell papers 'cause you put 'em so far into the store.

The boss then says
&gt; Sometimes folks take a paper and walk out without knowing they have to pay for them. We can't afford to give away papers for free.


The customer then tells her
&gt; Well, I think it's a waste of time to walk this far back when I can just grab one by the door.

Boss lady says
&gt; We want customers to come in and see what else they could buy [the papers sit right across from the meat case, and between candy bars and cold sodas].



The dude then has the nerve to say
&gt; Tell your boss to consider puttin' them at the front door then, or else I'll just go somewhere else to get my [local newspaper].

And without blinking, she says
&gt;Well, it's considered. I think I like the newspapers where they're at, so I'll keep them there. You can buy your newspaper elsewhere. Goodbye now, enjoy your day.""

bus214,Can I return this dress? Ignore the underwear.,"I used to work at a women's clothing store in a large out\-door mall in Los Angeles. The majority of our stock were jeans, tops, and ugly faux fur vests, but we also had a selection of ""special occasion"" dresses. These were usually on the skimpier side, and favored by young female 20 somethings headed to Las Vegas. Due to this trend, our store had a very strict 48\-hour return policy on these dresses, to try to deter women buying them, keeping the tag on, partying in Vegas, and returning them. When they are returned, they have to have a the original tag inside the dress attached, a tag that says ""48\-hour return policy"" that is attached to the OUTSIDE, and the original receipt. It was store policy to also write 48HRS in highlighter across the receipt just in case the customer missed/ignored the tags. 

That didn't stop plenty of customers from trying to return the dresses anyways. My personal favorite story is this: I am ME, the customer is C, and my manager is M

C: Walks up to the counter with a wrinkled bag and stands, staring at me, not saying anything. 

Me: Hello, did you want to return or exchange today?

C: Yes. I want to return this dress. \*tosses bad onto counter\*

Me: Oh no, I'm sorry, did it not work out?

C: No. I don't like it.

I took the dress out of the bag to ensure the tags were still attached. The tags were gone, the dress was wrinkled and there were pretty obvious deodorant stains on it. 

Me: Do you have the original receipt?

C: No. I threw it away.

Me: I'm sorry, we don't accept returns without the receipt, it doesn't have the tags, and this looks like it has been worn. We can't accept a return for this. 

She demanded to see my manager who I brought over and explained the situation. My manager says the same thing, we need a receipt etc etc.. while inspecting the dress.

M: I'm sorry, she's right this looks worn, and we have a strict rule to not accept returns if the item has been worn.

My manager is talking and lifts the dress to inspect it further. As she lifts it up, UNDERWEAR fall out of the bottom. Clearly used underwear. My manager and I stare at them in silence as the customer grabs them and sticks them in her purse. 

C: So can I return it?

M: \*Trying to stay professional\* No ma'am. You can't. You clearly wore it, we cannot accept this return. 

Thankfully the customer glared at us while tossing the dress back into the bag and stormed off without saying anything else. It was the weirdest attempted return I got the whole time I was there.

darth_ravage,"""When did you buy them?"" ""Yesterday""","[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/8e0qu1/how_old_is_your_return/) reminded me of a story from my time dealing with customer returns.

I worked at the customer service desk at a large grocery store chain. Officially, we had a very strict return policy \(14 days, receipt, unopened, ect.\), but usually we would just do the return unless it was just something completely unreasonable. This is one of those times.

One day this lady shows up and says she has some canned goods to return. And by some she meant a lot. Her basket was full to the top with cans. There must have been almost 100 of them. She looked like she was cleaning out her fallout shelter. 

&gt;Me: Why are you returning them?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Customer: They're expired.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;M: All of them?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;C: Yes.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;M: When did you buy them?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;C: Yesterday. Your store should do a better job of checking for expired food. I could have died.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;M: \(Mental eye roll\) Do you have you receipt?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;C: No. I didn't get one.

I was a bit skeptical. Canned goods usually have expiration dates of several years in the future. I found it very unlikely that we had had 100 cans sitting on our shelves for 3 \- 4 years without anyone buying them or noticing that they had expired. Especially since every time hurricane season came around, practically everything in a can would sell out. I found it even less likely that she managed to pick up only the expired cans while leaving all of the good ones alone. 

At this point I hadn't actually gotten a good look at the cans. The way our service desk was designed, you couldn't actually see the cart once it was it got close to the counter. So I walked around the desk to take a closer look. 

The cans were ancient. The labels were yellow and peeling. Some had brands or designs that I had never seen before, a few had no label at all, and they were all covered in a thick layer of dust. I picked one up at random and checked the expiration date. 1990. These cans were older than me! They may have even been older than the store. 

&gt;Me: ~~How stupid do you think I am?~~ Unfortunately ma'am, I can't return these without a receipt showing when you bought them. 

This of course led to the normal ""This is ridiculous, valuable customer, can't believe this, do you know who I am, shopped here for years, bla bla bla, let me speak to your manager.""

Luckily, our store was big enough that we usually had several managers on duty at a time. Anytime I needed a manager I could just call the one best suited to the type of customer that I was dealing with. So I called our most ""by the book"" manager. He would have denied the return just because of the missing receipt. He took one look at the dusty, yellow cans and told the customer to get lost. But in a slightly more polite manager way. 

She didn't even argue with him. Just shrugged and walked out the door. Like she didn't really expect us to give her a refund but wanted to try anyway. I called a few other stores in the area to warn them. Hopefully no one actually gave in, but I've seen some pretty spineless managers. She was probably successful at one of our other locations.

SL: Why aren't your pumps giving me gas????

Boss and I look at the computer and both say, ""it says it is pumping""

SL: uhh...nooooo it isn't.

My boss goes out to help while I help other customers. He comes back in getting a towel wet.

B: have you had issues with the pumps today? 

Me: no, not at all, what's up?

B: she says he tank is empty, the gas pump.keeps moving slow and popping off and then it flowed out. She's currently out there freaking out about gas being on her nice SUV and now the ground, saying everything is going to blow up. I'm going to go clean up her vehicle.

Me: if her vehicle's kicking gas back, that sounds like an issue with it. Mine did that and my fuel pump was bad, her keys could also be turned over and a lot of new cars will make pumping almost impossible if the cars in any form of on mode, you may want to check.

He goes back out there and comes back in with the most irritated look I've seen in almost 2 years, and I've seen him irritated before.

Me: what's wrong?

B: that moron had a full tank already! She was losing her mind over something being wrong with our tanks and claiming a little gas was going to blow her SUV up and she already had a full tank, she swore up and down it was empty before she got here!

I couldn't help but start laughing. Later I asked him if I parked at that pump, if my tank would magically become full again. He just started shaking his head and laughing as he walked away.

gonewildecat,I’ll be quick. I only have a couple of things to try.,"The mall I work in closes at 8pm. Literally all of the other malls in the area close at 9pm. So people are often surprised when we close “early “.  I’ll often close one of the doors at 7:45 to make it apparent we are closing soon. I usually turn the music off at 7:50. 

Tonight I was closing the first door when a woman and her teenage daughter walk in. She politely asked if we were closing and I said yes, in fifteen minutes so you have a little time. 

Normal people either walk around quickly or simply come back another time. I was busy recovering the store so I didn’t see what she was doing. I look at my watch and it’s now 8:01 so I close the other door and turn to remind her we’re closing. 

She’s at the back of the store with her arms absolutely overflowing with clothes AND her daughter is too. I walked over and said, “It is now after 8 and we do need to close “

She looks at her haul and says, “No problem, I only have a couple of things to try on.” And proceeds to brush past me into the fitting room. 

My coworker and I waited 45 minutes for her to try on everything. My hope being she at least makes a big purchase to make up for the inconvenience. 

She finally comes out of the fitting room with one item. ONE ITEM. And it’s the wrong size. I then had to order her that one item online. To make it worse, it was a sale item that only cost about $25. 

After we finally got her out the door and locked it behind her, we went into the fitting room. 58 items. None were hung up. None were right side out. It took another 30 minutes of both of us working to get it all straightened out.

PoorCashier,The cheeky jam woman,"Hello, Reddit! Another day, another story for you! I'll try to keep it short.


It happened a few days ago. I was one hour into my shift, when my manager asked me to go to another register, so that one of my colleagues could take a break.


So I flash a red, blinking light which says: ""Please don't get in line anymore"".

I always have some people who can't read and get in line anyways, but then I always tell them to please go to another register.


The cheeky jam woman came around the corner and walked towards my empty register, I was just preparing to take my till out of it. She only had one single jar of jam with her.


The thing is: Normally I would still check out customers with small shoppings, but my manager was pushing me to hurry up, so I could not do so.


Me: ""I'm sorry, please go to another register! Don't get in line here anymore!""

Woman: *walks further towards the register, ignoring me, then proceeds to put the jam on the belt* 

""Whoops, now I'm here.""


This really lit a fire in me. I stared at her for about five seconds. Then just took my till out of the register and said: ""Whoops, now I'm gone!"" and hurried to the register I was supposed to go to.


I never had someone give me such a hard death stare. My manager praised me for standing up to her, tho.

Baphometaphor,Sorry I didn’t realize you were closed!,"Obligatory long time lurker, first time posting opening line. 

Followed by the obligatory “this is posted from my mobile so bear with me” line. 

This happened a little over an hour ago and I was astounded. 

I work at a local bagel shop that closes at 3pm. We lock our doors officially at 3:05 just in case a customers clock runs slow or whatever. 

So we closed and locked the doors at 3:05 as per usual and flipped the signs to “CLOSED”. About 45 min into my close, an older woman tries the door, I ignore the noise as I’m used to it (it happens at least once a night). Most people will try both locked doors and then realize “oh I guess “CLOSED” means not open! Oh well!” And leave. 
 
This woman however tried both doors and then started pounding on the door. I alternates between pointing at the sign displaying our hours and the one stating we are closed for a full minute before turning around and unlocking the door to see what she wanted. She was older (70s probably) so I didn’t feel threatened, just irritated. “Are you open?” 
“No, ma’am. That is why the doors are locked.”

“I just need 6 dozen bagels though. Can I just-“ she tried to open the door more than the 4 inches I had opened it. 
 
“I don’t have any bagels left ma’am, we donate all of our end of day waste to non-profit organizations and the girl already came to pick them up. Our next closest location is located in the [generic town plaza] on (street) and (other street) next to Popular Shoe Brand Store. They are open until 5pm!” 

“Oh! My goodness! I didn’t realize you were closed!”(internal sigh, but I had a good day and I’m not letting it get me down) “But I don’t have a car. I walked here. Can’t you just sell me my bagels? I have company coming in the morning and I have nothing to feed them for breakfast.” 

“I am sorry ma’am but I have no bagels left to sell. That is 78 in total, and we would need at least a days notice to prepare and bake that many. I would be happy to write down your order for our morning baker to bake them for you in the morning. We open every day at [ungodly and a half hour] am so we can have them ready very early for you!” I am a happy person and I smile genuinely quite often, and I was smiling while I said this, being as polite and friendly as could be. 

Basically she walked away announcing she was going to call corporate to complain about this “catastrophe”. 

I was. Taken aback, to say the least. ",TalesFromRetail,1973,1524352616
elean0rigby,“I’m in a hurry! Please disregard the laws of mathematics and just let me take this item without paying!”,"I am the assistant manager at a furniture/home decor store. I have worked here over 7 years now. I was just thinking about an interaction I had on Monday.

We have this customer, who I’ll ironically name Patience. She’s older, in her 60s. Patience isn’t from my town, either. She’s from a nearby bigger city. Once a month, Patience’s son has a business meeting in town once a month and he brings his mom with him. While I think it’s sweet he tries to get her out of the house every once in a while, I do not appreciate that he decides to drop her off at my store for the duration of the meeting.

She has tormented my staff and I for up to 4 hours at a time.

Patience is needy, rude, and straight-up clueless about how the world works.

She expects that people shop with her. It’s impossible to break away and help others when we get busy. Lines are backing up at the POS and she’s handing you item after item to carry for her. She refuses to use a cart. It’s beyond annoying. Most of the time we all try to avoid her, but she always finds a way to inconvenience someone.

This past Monday she basically marched into the stockroom and dragged one of my associates who was working on our shipment of new items to the floor. Being polite, he tried to answer her question, but he had to get back to his job and she became pissy no one was helping her.

In the past she has had me get almost every item on our decorative shelves down for her to inspect, only to bitch about the price and beg that we come down a little. I have had to explain I don’t price my merchandise and the only coupons are through our members program..

Oh! And she’s a member, but she continues to max out her $500 limit and can never use her card. I’ve tried to explain this to her multiple times, but I don’t think she gets that she doesn’t have unlimited money on it.

So on Monday, we got slammed and we had lines forming at the POS. My associate was already ringing people up and so was I. Patience comes up to pay for 3 items. Item A was $10 on clearance, items B and C were both $15. Patience mentioned she had a couple for 20% off. I knew which one she was talking about. It was on regular priced items with a purchase on her card.

I applied the coupon to Items B and C. After tax it was like $37. She went to use her card, but like I mentioned above, she doesn’t have available credit. I told her the coupon only works with the card, but I could use the other coupon for 15% off instead and the transaction totaled around $38.50. She paid in cash.

I continue to help the ladies in line and Patience makes for the door.

A few moments later, as I’m helping another customer, she approaches me with Item D, wanting to purchase it instead of Item C, but Item D has slight damage to it and she wants a discount. Item D is originally $40, on clearance for $25. I told her I could do no more than 20% off the time, but since it’s “damaged” it’d be non returnable. She’s says ok, could I do it quickly, she’s in a hurry.

I explain I’m with a customer, I’ve got 3 more in line. I’m gonna need her to hop in line. She’s says again “but I’m in a hurry!” I tell her I understand, but the other ladies have been waiting in line.

She reluctantly gets in line behind the 3 ladies. As I’m starting my first transaction, she’s begging the women in line to let her go before them. They take pity on her and give up their spots.. I’m pissed, but I’m keeping my customer service smile.

I do a return for Item C and ring up Item D with the 20% off. I tell her she owes $8 or so.. she doesn’t understand. I explain the item she’s trading it for was less than the new item.

Patience: You didn’t apply that item to this one. I am in a hurry. Please hurry up.

Me: Ma’am you owe $8.

P: I don’t get it?

Me: The Item C is less than Item D. You owe $8.

P: I’m in a hurry. Please just apply the return to this item.

Me: I did, they’re different prices.. you owe the difference.

P: ...?

Me: ...

P: I don’t get it. I already paid $40. Why do I have to pay more?

Me: Because this item is $25 and the other was $15.. ma’am, let me clarify. You only wanted to return Item C, not all three?

P: Yes.

Me: Okay, you owe $8.

P: Oh, you probably didn’t apply the coupon.

Me: I didn’t; it’s on clearance. But you got the 20% damage discount. You owe $8 after the discounts.

P: I’m in a hurry. My son is here.

Me: So here’s how this works: either you pay $8 and get Item D, or you keep Items A, B, and C..

P: Please, I’m in a hurry.

Me: ...

P: ...?

Me: What are we doing? Are you keeping all 3 or paying the difference.

P: I’ll pay the difference.

Me: Okay that’s $8.

P: ...?

Me: ...

P: Okay, just forget it! I’m in a hurry!

I needed a break after that. I can’t even imagine what she was trying to pull. I don’t know how stupid she thought I was, but her pity game wasn’t going to work on me.

My associate told me to go take breather and the three ladies in line all apologized for letting her butt in line.

*phone rings* 

ME: Hello and thank you for calling -store-! My name is Nugget, how can I help you? 

Crazy Old Lady: Hi, I ordered some white pants from your store. When will they be delivered to my house? 

Me: Alright, it will take me just one moment to pull that information up for you. If you can give me the order number that was emailed to you when you completed the purchase, I can look that up right away. 

COL: I just need to know when my white pants are arriving. 

ME: I understand, but I will need your order number in order to look up that information. 

COL: WHERE. ARE. MY WHITE. PANTS. 

Me: I apologize ma’am, but I cannot look up your order status without an order number.  

COL: (Clearly getting agitated with me) I just need to know where my white pants are! 

Me: Okay, perhaps I can look up your order number if you provide me with your email address. 

COL: I don’t have email. Where. Are. My. White. Pants. 

Me: Ma’am, it is impossible to place an order without an email address. Without an email address or order number, there is nothing I can do for you, unfortunately. 

COL: Well, you know my email address. 

Me: ...I’m sorry, but I don’t. 

COL: why NOT?! 

Me: Because... I don’t know... you? 

COL: Ugh. FINE. 


After that she just hung up on me. My boss was keeled over laughing during this entire exchange and I needed to hit my head on the wall for a minute.

Larktheshark81,Drunk lady gets mad when I won't sell her alcohol,"When I was in college, I worked in a liquor department of a grocery store. This was in Missouri where you can buy any sort of alcohol in a grocery store.

So one evening this lady stumbles in and walks around the store with friend for a few minutes. They are loud and obviously drunk.

They come to the counter and I ask, ""how are you doing tonight."" She responds, ""I'm drunk, but I need more!"" as she slams her basket on the counter. In the basket was a handle of vodka and some mixers.

I told her, ""Not only are you visibly drunk, but you just told me that you are intoxicated. I am not legally allowed to sell to you.""

She flips out and starts yelling at the top of her lungs. Co workers from other departments run over to see what the hell is going on.

I calmly asked her to leave. She told me she ""would leave, but come back with her man to fuck me up."" Then I told her that I was calling the police. She leaves the store and is cussing all the way to the parking lot. They had a third friend waiting in driver seat of the car. Loud girl tells driver what happened. The driver then climbs halfway out of the window and screams with a slurred, ""She's not drunk!"" then they speed out of the parking lot. 

I snapped a pic of their plates as they drove away. I called the police and told them what happened. An hour later a cop showed up and told me that the driver had a suspended license (from a previous DUI). They arrested her, but couldn't locate the other lady for threatening me.

So I have told people this story before and they always said I was a hardass. Now since I worked for a grocery chain, we were always having ""secret shoppers"" come in to test our customer service skills and check our security. Occasionally they would send incognito assistant managers from other stores in the chain to try and walk in employee only areas just to see if our workers were paying attention. With the knowledge that this could have been a setup, I didn't want to get in trouble. 

Plus if they had gotten in a wreck and had a receipt with my name on it, I would have been fucked. I honestly would have received no benefit from selling to a drunk stranger..

TLDR Lady tells me she is drunk, then flips out and threatens me. Turns out her DD is drunk. An arrest was made.

H_R_Welker,"""Do I still have time to buy this?""","*sorry for the formatting I'm on mobile*

So I work at a local resale store and we close at 7 on weeknights. One night a lady and her daughter come in literally 2 minutes before close. Normally we lock the door and start closing up at 2 mins. Anyway we told them we were closing in 2 mins and they said ok and that they would be quick. That was a lie. The daughter decided to try on a bunch of dresses and she was not quick. At this point it's past 7 so we inform them that we are closed. The lady says ok and that her daughter is almost done. Another 5 mins go by and she is still trying on dresses. My co worker goes up to them again and explains we are closed. The lady gets huffy this time and says ""does she not even have time to try on a few dresses?"" (She did if she didn't take 5 mins to try on one dress) At this point me and my co worker just want to go home. The lady finally comes up to the counter with a dress and rudly asks ""do I have time to pay for this?"" I politely said ""yes"" and started ringing her up. Once we finished the sale we let her and her daughter out. 

TL:DR
Rude lady and her daughter come in 2 mins to close and expect us to wait all night on them. Then she gets mad when we tell her repeatedly we are closed. ",TalesFromRetail,1622,1524059186
blueberii,You expect me to read?!,"I worked at a lousy gas station for awhile and this gas station was not so well managed and we were regularly out of important supplies, like toilet paper or all soda fountain lids, or gloves for putting out food.

One day we were out of toilet paper again, and I had to leave a big, bright, beautiful note on the men's bathroom stating we were out of TP and to use the women's room if needed as there was some left in there.

I had one of my usually-drunk old man regulars come in and go to the bathroom only to come out and rant about no toilet paper. I told him that yes its stupid we ran out of TP but I had a big, hard to miss sign on the men's room stating go to the women's. He yelled, ""What! You expect me to read! How stupid!""

NottNott,Customer makes me remember something important,"My uncle had passed away recently - two weeks before this tale takes place. Just a customer service assistant, serving customers and stacking shelves. On this day it was definitely more serving customers, it was really busy.

I've loved every moment I got with my uncle since I was born. He was really knowledgeable, and used to teach me about all sorts of things you'd only know if you've read dozens of books over many years. Half the time over all these years he'd be chewing one type of chewing gum over and over while he gives me a lecture, grinning all the way, and I couldn't help but remember the smell of the gum along with whatever he'd teach me. It was just my uncle's smell.

After two hours on till non-stop I'm exhausted. I serve a gum-chewing customer, and I catch a smell of the exact same type of gum that my uncle used to chew on her breath. It makes me really sad, and as I pack her bags a sense of professionalism goes out of the window.

&gt;""Sorry, this is going to sound like a really, really weird question, but can I ask what gum you're chewing right now?""

She pulls out the packet and shows me, asking me why I asked. I told her that my uncle had recently passed away and that I always used to remember that type of gum on his breath. Soon she's off and I'm serving someone else.

Thirty minutes of intense customer serving later, she comes back to the tills without any of the products that we sell. I've already forgotten her face by now and I'm confused who this person is without any products. But she holds out a brand new packet of the chewing gum she was chewing and hands it to me. I'm taken aback by a lot, and she explains that she just went and bought it from another store on site. As she walks off and I continue to serve customers, I couldn't help but feel delighted over what happened. After I get the chance to chew it the gum smelled just like my uncle's too.",TalesFromRetail,931,1523996988
PoorCashier,"No, I won't commit a crime by selling you alcohol","Hello TFR! Another story for you guys.


It happened a few months back, but I just remembered this story.

It was twenty minutes before our grocery store closed and there came a lady, wanting to buy (among other items)  a bottle of vodka. Vodka is allowed at the age of 18 here in Germany. The lady, tho, looked younger than that to me.


Me: ""Excuse me, but may I see your ID?"" 

Lady: *shocked* ""I-I don't have it with me..""

Me: ""Anything else? I just need something with your date of birth. Insurance card? License?""

Lady: ""No, I have nothing with me, I left my purse at home""

Me: ""I'm sorry, but I can't sell you this alcohol without verifying your age. It would be a crime.""


She then proceeded to tell me her whole life story. That her father had died, they threw a funeral party (it's common over here, don't know about other countries) and that they run out of alcohol at the party. That she's an university student and has a kid and that she really needs this alcohol.

Like, yeah, good for you and I still can't sell this to you. What do you think how many people are dishonest about alcohol? It's your responsibility to bring your ID with you, I'm not the one at fault.

She really guilt tripped me.


Me: ""Madam, there's no use in telling me your story, I'm sorry for your loss, but I can't sell this to you.""

Lady: ""But please, it's so important! Thw whole party will be ruined because of YOU!""

Me: ""Madam, I really can't do anything about this situation right now. The policy in our store is ""If you're in doubt, only sell age-limited items after a look at the ID"". Since you don't have it with you, it's your own fault.""


In the meantime, we closed, and my manager had enough and threw her out.

Fakjbf,Do people not know how to buy gas?,"Two more funny stories from the gas station I recently started working at (first story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/8ct88f/do_you_want_me_to_die/?st=JG3QR52E&amp;sh=e188c7ae)). These are fairly short and similar so I figured I’d merge them into one post.

This first story happened on Saturday. This was the first day of Snowstorm Evelyn, which dropped over two feet of snow on my city this past weekend. As I’m at the register someone outside hits the “pay inside” button. I look out the window and see that their front license plate is covered by a snowplow. We have to be able to see a license plate to let them pump before paying, in case of drive offs. So I told him that I couldn’t authorize the pump, he would have to turn the truck around so we could see the rear plate or come inside to pay. I thought no more of it and went back to helping check out the people in line.

A few minutes later a guy comes to my register, and when I ask if he had gas outside he just glared at me. He then started complaining that we didn’t authorize the pump so he wouldn’t be able to get gas, saying that we were terrible people, don’t we know several gas stations nearby are closed, we shouldn’t prevent people from getting gas. I reiterated that he could simply pay right here at the register, or turn the truck around so we could see the rear plate if he really wanted to pay outside. He just glared again, paid for his sandwich and left saying he’d take his business elsewhere. He was literally at the register, a couple button presses and he could have had his gas and been on his way, but if he wants to make life more difficult for himself that’s fine by me.

The second story happened on Sunday. Once again I’m at the register, and again I hear the beeping of someone wanting to pump then pay. When I look at their car I see they have a dealership plate on, which we can’t use to authorize the pump. My coworker told them to either turn the car around or pay inside first. After thirty seconds the beeping times out, and then the guy outside hits the button again to pay outside. We ignore it for another thirty seconds until it stops. For a third time he hits the button. So I throw on the reflective vest, walk out to him and tell him that we can’t authorize the pump based on the dealer plate. He looks at m for a few seconds then says, “But I want to pump my gas before paying”. I again tell him that he’ll have to pay first, either out here with a card or to come inside. He looks at me for a few more seconds and then said, “I’ll pay out here”. 

By the time I got back inside he had already hit the pump and pay button again. At that point we asked our manager what to do, he said to just let him keep hitting the button and do nothing. About a minute later he gave up and drove off, presumably to go pester a different gas station. The best part was that there were a couple customers who had come into the store when he first arrived, and when I pointed out to my coworker that the guy had finally left one of the customers looked outside and said “Well it took him long enough to get the hint”.",TalesFromRetail,1091,1523975324
mynameiswrong,Customer tried to jump the line,"Today I was called to the front to help with the line at the registers. I had to grab my till (the part with the money) from the locker in the office and put it into a register. While I was shutting the lid on the register to lock my till in the register I looked up and saw a lady who was at the back of the line come up to my register. Nah, I don't play that game.   

Me: I'm not opening yet.  

Customer looked pissed but went back to the line. There was a broom and dustpan in my register area so I moved it over to the wall out of the way and went outside to get a shopping cart (we don't have an area to put stuff after ringing the items so we have to have a cart to put customers' items in). At that point I go to the person who was next in line and directed them to my register and then the person after them. I rang several people up when my cashier said my name and that he was going to the back real quick. Ok. Then out of seemingly nowhere the line jumper appeared and positioned herself right in front of my register where you would swipe your card. I was mid transaction but this lady did not care.

Lady: Excuse me *mynameiswrong*, why did you say you weren't open but then took these people?!  

Me: Because I wasn't open yet. I had to go get a cart and besides the policy is the next in line goes to an opening register. 

Lady: No! I am very hungry and it was my choice to go next!

I shook my head and said: Company policy is next in line.

Lady: Well *mynameiswrong*, I am going to call corporate and complain about you!  

She pointed her finger in my face. This whole time I hadn't stopped scanning.

I nodded: Ok. 

I looked at the next customer and told them their total. The angry lady sauntered out of the store. My customer was very quiet and after she payed said ""please don't get bothered by that."" 

Me: Hmm? Oh, that. Eh, it happens daily it doesn't bother me.

Nice lady: Oh...

Edit: the store I work at is very fast at checkout. Most of my associates ring 900-1100 items an hour with about 4 seconds between customers. Today I rang  a little over 1200. She ended up having to wait maybe a minute or two",TalesFromRetail,1040,1523942348
Fakjbf,Do you want me to die?,"I recently started working at a gas station (major Midwestern chain). For now I spend most of my shifts up at the register and am slowly learning various other responsibilities.

Up to my register come a mother and her ~10 y/o child, both fairly heavy set. They have a loaf of bread, several handfuls of candy, and a half dozen sodas. As I’m scanning everything the daughter is constantly trying to add packs of gum and such to the pile, and the mom was not having it. She kept telling the daughter that she had enough sugar and she didn’t need any more, but the daughter just kept trying to add items and was getting a bit upset.

We finish up the transaction and they start to leave, with the mom carrying all the bags. On their way out they pass a display case of muffins and donuts, and the daughter of course wants some. So the mom tells the daughter that she can have a muffin if she’ll carry the bag of sodas. The daughter immediately started throwing a tantrum, saying that the mom was being so unfair because all she wanted was a single muffin. The mom simply shoved all the bags into her hands and started getting a muffin for her. The daughter started crying and said, “But they’re so heavy! Do you want me to drop this on your foot? Do you want me to die???”

At that point the mom gave up and took all the bags back, then had to daughter get the muffin and take it to register to pay. The entire time I tried to keep my face as neutral as possible, but it was hard to keep a straight face watching the daughter just walk all over her like that and get her way in the end.",TalesFromRetail,1649,1523932246
ChumberSnap,It's 10 items or less....,"So my day starts off alright. I get to work around 3:30 right after school, and I start cashiering in the 10 or less lane at about 5 to help get the traffic that built up at the lanes moving a little faster. As soon as I hop on the 10 items lane, boss man (who will from now be known as BM) starts directing people with fewer items to my lane. 

In comes lady 1 (who will now be L1), And lady 2 (you guessed it, L2). There are maybe 2 customers before  the both of them, so they have about a 2 minute wait until either of them can get checked out. Keep in mind BM told everyone who is in my lane to come over here to get things flowing better. The customer in front of L1 starts paying and something happens with her card. No big deal but I grab BM to help out. L1 has all of her items layed out on the conveyor. L2 keeps eyeing them. Aggressively. 

&gt;L1: Is something wrong miss? 

&gt;L2: Yes there is actually.

&gt;L2 to BM: She has eleven items. This is the express lane. 

BM looks at me with the most dead, blank and unamused expression that only said ""u/chumbersnap are we actually going to have to deal with this..."" 

I look back and I can't help but laugh. The entire time I'm ringing up L1 who is standing there. Laughing. 

&gt;BM: I can assure you that my cashier will only take a few seconds longer to finish up with the extra item. Is there anything else I can do for you? 

(That was a mistake) 

&gt;L2: letmeseeyourmanager.exe

You can pretty much guess what happened from there. Big argument with the manager and L2. BM let's me take an extra 15 (score) and L1 gets a nice little discount on her items as an apology from BM. 

Eventually L2 came back through my lane to get checked out. She had 13 items.",TalesFromRetail,664,1523889216

Me: I can guarantee that the register adds correctly, are you sure you didn't get a 9? 

Lady: Yes I'm sure. Here, you count it.

I was a little confused over why she trusted my math more than a computer and a little annoyed because it was about 15 items.  Reached for my phone only to remember that it was charging in the break room. I tried to get out of having to add them up.

This little old lady (OL) for short came in and was waiting in line at the register. A customer in front of her was being rather difficult and she was waiting her turn and didn't say much of anything. She came to the counter and said ""I need this thing to put around my face to for when I spray my hair. It's got a little handle on it and is curved like a mask.""

I told her I may have to step to the counter to ring someone up if we get busy but I'll do what I can. Everything is still fine. 

Someone steps up to the counter with their purchase so I step away to ring them up and about the time I get up there OL comes up to the register, I ask them if they have our card, if they'd like to get one, etc., start scanning their purchase, and then OL states she has one and I'd need to look her up, throws her purse on the counter, scoots their purchase aside, and tries to talk over them. I continue ringing the other couple up and send them on their way.

I was even going to pay for that girl's stuff it had been 10 or 15 dollars but when I heard 50 some dollars I thought Oh no, I won't be paying that. If they had asked to step in front of me I would've let them or if you would've. Instead you went ahead and rang them up in front of me. That's not very polite. Actually, it's quite rude.

LegionGaming2k,$40 of Produce With No Receipt? Good Luck Buddy,"Hey all!




This one comes from last week. It was Monday so it was slow as per usual. At the time, I was restocking the mushroom was when I was called to the front desk for customer assistance/product pick-up. My coworker was on break at the time, so it was just me for about half an hour until he came back. When coming up to the front desk, i notice customer standing there with three bags. As I get to the desk itself, the smell hits me, rotten produce. It's explained to me that all of it had gone bad. This is where it all goes downhill. For reference, Me is Me, C is Customer, and MA is Manager.




**Me**: ""Hello. I'm really sorry about the poor quality of the items. I wish I knew what was up with them but-""




**C**: So you don't know what's wrong with them? Have you been having this before?




**Me**: Unfortunately yes. I'm really sorry about that. May I ask what you bought?""



**C**: Two personal watermelons and eight organic blueberries. I only have six of the berry containers, tossed the other two.""




**Me**: Well I can take the containers back for counting.""




**C**: Could I get a refund?""





At this point we called a manager up to deal with this, as I was in no position to do a refund. A minute or so later, a store manager comes up from the backroom and begins to ask about the product, when he got it, the whole nine yards. When asked when he purchased the products, he not only shot himself in the foot, but proceeded to saw his entire leg off.




**C**: ""Well I got them a week and a half ago. There were on my counter before I had to throw them out. And I pulled them out of the trash a couple days ago.""




I tried so hard not to crack a smile. While the customer's facial expression remained largely annoyed, I could tell by the look in his eyes that he fucked up. He then produced a half-assed threat of never shopping at our store again.





**MA**: ""Wait. You bought these a week and a half ago, threw them in the trash, then fished them out a couple days ago and decided to bring them in now?""




**C**: ""Yes. I would like a refund on them.""





**MA**: ""Well just by looking at all this, I can tell it's over $40 worth of produce, so I'll need your receipt in order to confirm you bought them here.""




**C**: ""My receipt? No one ever told me I would need my receipt to make a return! And why would I try to give back produce from another store? I would never do something like that!""




**MA**: ""I'm sure you wouldn't sir, but we need to confirm that it's from here and not *store*, *store*, *store*, or *store*. But we can take these for you and throw them out.""




**C**: ""So you'll take them and not give me a refund? No, that's not gunna happen. I'll keep these. This is just ridiculous. Can I have corporate's number?""




My store manager gladly writes down corporate's number and his name in case they ask who gave him the number or something. The store manager then walks away, leaving me with this guy. I stood there and watched, trying to keep a straight face, waiting until he left or I was told. At this point, he calling corporate and waiting for someone to pick up.





**C**: *to me* ""Can you believe this? Says he'll help me by taking them back, but won't give me a refund?""




**Me**: ...




**C**: ""Think corporate will help me out?""




**Me**: ""I think they'll say the same thing.""




I then left, to go back to my mushrooms, and carry on with my day, telling the story to my coworker.

cascer1,Customers don't understand how 50% off works,"I work in a department store. Every now and then we have crazy promotions on already discounted items. Yesterday, we had a promotion where all discounted items were 1+1 (applied through 50% off on each item). This can lead up to situations where you can get 85% off on some items.

During previous years when we ran this promotion, we would simply make the cheapest item of every combination free. This was done automatically and resulted in some shitty discounts being given because the register would pick the most expensive item and link it to a cheap item so that you would get almost no discount. However, this year is different because we just give every item 50% off. If you have an odd number of qualifying items, the most expensive items get a discount. 

Because of this new way of calculating the discount, there is no way you can game the system to pay even less, because it's already set up to give you the highest discount possible.

This, however, does not dissuade some customer from acting like idiots.

---

This story takes place 15 minutes before closing. Featuring: **ME**, **L**(ady)

The lady walks up to the register with five discounted items. Three of them costing €7.50 each, and two costing €2 each.

&gt; **ME** (after ringing her up):That'll be €14.25 please  
&gt; **L**: I thought it was 1+1?  
&gt; **ME**: That's right! I discounted all the €7.50 items, and one of the €2 items.  
&gt; **L**: No I want the discount on the expensive items  
&gt; **ME**: You already have the best discount you can get  
&gt; **L**: Well then separate them into different transactions  

*sigh*

&gt; **ME**: Separating the items into different transactions will reduce your discount quite a bit  
&gt; **L**: I know what you're doing! You just want to make me pay more. Separate the items or I'm not buying anything

Like I care if she buys her stupid tea cups or not.

&gt; **ME**: Alright, but I promise that you won't get a better deal this way  
&gt; **L**: You always say that, just do it already.  

She comes up with the following combination:

* Both €2 items together for a total of €2
* Two €7.50 items together for a total of €7.50
* One €7.50 alone

This totals to €17, this is €2.75 more expensive than what I offered. She didn't notice and paid each of the transactions. After this she studies her receipts.

&gt; **L**: YOU SWITCHED THE PRICES AROUND

mattycat3,Customer confessed to murder,"I work at a grocery store, I was scheduled as the closing cashier. And was alone for the last two hours of my shift (boss was busy counting tills and doing stuff in the office). About an hour before closing(10pm), an older man in athletic gear comes in and gets three 40s of beer. He was the only customer in the store at the time and seemed kind of sketchy but normal enough. We were chatting and and having general small talk when this conversation happened:

Customer: Heyy, just remembered it's Friday! 

Me: I work all weekend. 

Customer: At least you're making money and staying out of trouble, working all the time will keep you out of jail... But doesn't leave a lot of time for fun. 

Me: true. But I'm 35,000 in debt. And 9 dollars an hour isn't much.

Customer: you're doing better than me, the bank owns my house. I made 230,000 dollars last year and I spent it on an RV, a camper and hookers. Then I killed them. 

Me: what?

Customer: (looks around then stares at me) don't worry about it. 

And without skipping a beat, hastily makes his retreat.. I hope he was just screwing with me, but it felt more like a slip of the tongue than a joke.

ReginaldVSSircee,“So you’re mad because we preemptively ordered your feed?”,"~disclaimer: posting on mobile so sorry for formatting~

This just happened yesterday. I work at a fairly popular feed store chain as one of the key holders. While working what I call the gravy shift (10-6), I get this phone call for a special order. From here, we will refer to this lady as SUEL(Stuck-up Equine Lady)
SUEL: hi I need to place a special order for my horse food 
Me: okay! If you don’t mind, I’m going to need to place you on hold for just a minute while I finish helping a customer in store 
SUEL: well why did you answer if you aren’t able to help me immediately? That seems terribly rude to your customers who call 
Me: I totally agree ma’am, however I am the only other person currently working other than my cashier so I am doing the best I can. Like I said, I will be back momentarily 
~30 seconds later~
Me: okay! Sorry about that wait, what feed is it you need us to special order?
SUEL: well finally, I’ve been waiting for 5 minutes. I need *insert popular brand special diet horse food here*
Me: okay how many did you need?
SUEL: 8
~meanwhile I’m pulling the feed up on our store website, as I’m pretty certain I have it already~
Me: okay! Actually, it appears my other manager has already special ordered this for you and it is in. 
SUEL: well how is that possible? I didn’t call?
Me: well ma’am, if you/a customer habitually has us special order a certain horse feed, we preemptively set it up on a regular schedule that you seem to be following so every 4-5 weeks from what I’m seeing. 
SUEL: so what you’re telling me is it is old feed. 
Me: umm. No ma’am. What I’m saying is your horse feed is already here, probably gettin here this Wednesday, which means you are able to just come and pick it up at your earliest convenience. 
SUEL: how dare you just assume I would want it again? For all you know, my horse could have died since I last called. 
Me: and if that were the case ma’am, you have no obligation to purchase the feed we ordered for you. Many other customers get this for their older horses, so it wouldn’t be a problem on our end
SUEL: well you know what they say about assuming stuff. 
Me: yep. I do. Luckily this isn’t one of those cases. Like I said, the feed is here, come and get it when you are able to
SUEL: *starts screaming profanities at me about how I’m a presumptuous bitch and such*
Me: OKAY WELL HAVE A GREAT DAY *click* 

Why be upset? Like we have he feed you needed and now you don’t have to wait 2 weeks for it to get here??? ",TalesFromRetail,3145,1523714627
kovvens,Just get the f*** out of my store,"I'm a manager (M) at a small mom and pop business, we are a head shop (we sell pipes, bongs, vapes, etc.) in Colorado. We have a strict policy that we can only sell things to people who are 18+ years old, and that if someone comes in with a minor, we can no longer sell them anything and that they must leave. 

I was doing inventory on my day off while another girl was working, we'll call her B. When we work in the store, we typically work alone from open to close. She was experiencing a rush and I was putting some inventory onto my clipboard in the back room. I came out to check on how she was doing and making sure I didn't need to step in and help, when I came out she was ringing up a customer and the only people left were two people together, an older woman (OW) and a younger man (YM).

Typically, we card anyone who looks under 30 years old at the door, but since I was in the back and she was handling other customers, neither one of us had a chance. No big deal since no purchase was made. 

I had to check the amount on a few items on the floor so I was letting B handle the customers while I did that. The store isn't that big, you can hear a conversation from the whole other side. Now, keep in mind that we are not obligated to be kind to rude customers here. When someone is rude, we can go full force, as the owners of the store do not agree with customers verbally abusing employees (bless them). 

B: ""hey there! thank you guys for being so patient, I'm gonna need to see your ID real quick though."" gesturing at YM. 

OW: ""he doesn't have an ID, he's my son, he's only 16 years old.""

B: ""oh, I see, well unfortunately since he's a minor, and I'm not sure if you're going to be purchasing an item to contribute to him, I'm not going to be able to sell you anything. I'm really sorry but I'm going to have to ask you to leave.""

OW: ""You're f***ing kidding me right? Why the f*** would I buy something for my son here?"" 

At this point I'm tuning into the conversation, figuring I'm going to have to step in because B is an extremely nice person and not very good at handling conflict. 

B: ""I'm really sorry, it's not only a store policy, but it's actually the law.""

OW: ""I'm not going anywhere, I'm not buying anything for my son, you're going to sell me whatever the f*** I need and give me a discount for how ignorant you're being.""

At this point, I saw B give me the look of wanting some help so I walked over to the wicked old bag. 

M: ""Excuse me, I'd REALLY appreciate it if you didn't talk to her like that. We aren't going to sell you anything and you both need to leave immediately."" 

YM: ""That's f***ing bulls**t.""

Now, at this point, I'm done with these people. I'm not a very nice person when someone is rude, actually I'm a HUGE a**hole. 

M: ""I'm sorry, but I think you need to shut up and get out of this store. Both of you, now.""

OW: ""Or what? I think you need to do whatever I say or else I'm going to have to see the manager of this store."" 

M: ""Oh, fantastic, I thought you'd never ask. My name is Kat, I'M the manager of this fine establishment and it would be just f***ing dandy if you would leave."" 

OW: ""Is that how you talk to your customers? Is that how you talk to other people?"" 

M: ""Nope, actually I'm super nice to my good customers. But when you seem to be buying adult products for a minor, be rude to my employees, be demanding like a 5 year old who hasn't had her a** wiped in three hours and come at me with a whole lot of bull, I'm not so lovely.""

OW: ""Why would I buy something for my 16 year old son? He's just a kid!""

M: ""Listen, lady, when I was 16 my parents were buying me cigarettes and now I have a nicotine addiction, we're not stupid here. I suggest you leave before things get uglier.""

OW: ""ARE YOU THREATENING ME? I'M GOING TO CALL THE POLICE FOR YOU THREATENING ME AND MY SON.""

M: ""That's fine and dandy and all, go ahead and call the police and I'll happily explain the them how you came in here asking your son about what size he wants which can cause you hefty fine of up to $5,000 for contributing to a minor, how you're trespassing after being told to leave, how you're berating my employee and how you've attempted to convince US to contribute to a minor. If that's honestly what you want? So by all means, call the cops, just get the f*** out of my store.""

She quickly grabbed her son by the arm and told him that they would just go to our other location and left. 

I called the other locations to let them know this broad was on the move. ",TalesFromRetail,730,1523680029
LurkingLikeFreddy,How dare you change that kid's clothes in public!,"I used to work at a clothing store and one of my jobs was to change the wardrobe of the mannequins.  We do this on the floor because a lot of them are high up on platforms and it's really much easier to pull them down, plunk them on a rolling cart and change their outfits before going back up the rolling steps and putting them back.

I was doing this in the children's section and I have a child mannequin about the size of a five-year-old on my rolling cart.  It was one slated for female clothing, so it had on a knee-length skirt, a summery top and a girl's hat.  According to the style guide, they wanted to keep the hat but change the rest of the outfit.  I changed the shirt and threw the hat back on top before pulling down the skirt so I wouldn't have to lift the mannequin all the way off its stand.

It is at this point that a woman starts screaming.  I look around and this woman on the other side of the children's section is pointing wildly at me.  It's really early in the morning, so the only other people there are the cashier, who's got three people in line, and the manager, who's deactivated the emergency door in the back of the store so she can vape instead of working.

W: What the hell are you doing?!

M: I'm sorry?

W: How dare you change her clothes in public! The changing station is right there!

The pointing finger moves to the kids' changing stall.

I quickly realize that she thinks I'm a customer (we don't really have uniforms and she's far enough away that she probably can't see my name tag).  I look back at my mannequin and note something else.  If she was looking over my shoulder, all she see around my body is an arm, the downed skirt and the hat.

So, with a flourish, because at this point, I'm so sick of this job I really don't care if I get fired, I spin back and yank the hat off the mannequin and step away.  The child mannequins here do not have heads.  Facing a headless, half-clothed, marble-white mannequin, she goes from squawking to silent and red-faced in an instant before storming into another section and I go back to changing children in public.",TalesFromRetail,4499,1523660066
sarcasmbecomesme,"""I'll be right back.""","I thought of this story while reading another one on this sub, but I didn't want to hijack it, so I thought I'd just make a new post.

This is from when I worked at a big box store as a cashier.

A lady once came through my lane with a large cartload of groceries. This wouldn't be so bad normally, but I was on a short lane - 15 items or less. But, of course, since it was a slow minute, management made me check her through. We got about halfway through, when she suddenly stopped and said she had to go pick up her son from baseball practice. 

*sigh*

She said it would only take a few minutes since the ballpark was close, and she asked that we keep her cart there until she got back. And out the door she went. Problem was, there were many cold items in her cart, including meat and milk, and things that can't be out too long. It got busy right about then (of course), so I let management know about the cart and carried on with customers. 

They ended up putting the cold items away before they'd been out too long, and the cart sat there for *three hours* before management decided to just put everything away.

At least another hour went by before the lady *finally* showed up again. (Honestly, I was surprised she'd bothered to show up at all.) She was upset that her items had been put away, and she must have complained to management, because they came by, turned my light off, and made me go help her find everything she'd had in the cart.

I actually apologized to the lady for the inconvenience, and she complained that she hadn't been gone very long, and she only stopped by her house to take a ""quick"" shower before she came back. I didn't say anything else after that. I just collected as many items as I could, and then I excused myself back to my lane as soon as possible.

That one still makes me grind my teeth when I tell it, and it's been several years. ",TalesFromRetail,660,1523630849
UndeadDragon,I’m sorry your card keeps declining.,"Scene: I work in a large chain supermarket as the service desk supervisor. The time is now 5 mins past closing, I and my college go home in 10 mins and we are getting the last few customers out. 

Story: I finish off closing the self scan machines and go to help pack for my college (WC). As I approach WC the customer is having trouble with her card. 

Card Lady: (in very poor English, probably second or third language) I Just get my husband. 

Me; No problem, I’ll just suspend your shopping and we can deal with it. 

CL nods and calls her husband. (Internally, please be an easy fix, I want to go home. 

WC and I greet the next customer through a quick chat we discover that she has just moved house and is new to the area and just had to get the essentials, that is why she is in so late. She is apologetic and really lovely. 

CL’s husband comes to the locked door. 

Me: (to CL) Is that your husband?

CL: Yes.

I let him in he hands CL some cash. As this happens Moving house Lady finishes her payment and is packing up her trolley. 

CL: Can we pay two ways?  

WC: Yes that’s fine. (He try’s the lesser amount of $66.57 on the card. The card declines. CL’s face drops. I feel a little crushed inside.)

Moved House Lady: (finishing off packing her trolley) What’s the difference? 

Me: $66.57

MHL: I’ll pay for it. 

Me: are you sure? (CL is distracted by her husband at this point and doesn’t notice this)

MHL pays. The transaction is complete. I hand CL the receipt.

CL: What?

MHL: I got you. It’s all paid for. 

CL: No no. 

MHL: It is already done. Take your shopping enjoy your night. 

CL: Thank you. I pay back. 

MHL: You don’t have to. 

I then let them both out of the store and they chat for a few more minutes outside. They are both smiling and laughing. 

It is now 12 past closing and I finish up the close and go hope feeling happy that I could witness such kindness.

JayNovae,Phone call complaint about 10p bags,"Just a bit of context - in the UK by law we must charge 5p for a bag. I work in a large retail shop that has a really bad reputation on the high street as Britain's worst shop. We sell things like newspapers, sweets and stationery.

Anyway, so my managers comes up to me and tells me that our larger Bag For Life has gone up to 10p today and I'm not too bothered as we were charging 1p for bags 6 months before the law was passed for 5p and the abuse was insane. For such a small amount! Regardless I thought this wouldn't be too bad as larger bags in most shops in the UK, especially supermarkets range from 10p-20p already so the public have gotten used to this now.

Boy was I wrong. I'm the sort of person that will have a little argue back, I can't help myself but this time I didn't even get the chance. The phone was ringing at work and most people don't answer it and I'm part of the management team so I have to. So before ive done my usual spew answering the phone an older man rudely interrupts me down the phone. For the sake of this I will call him RM (rude man).

Me:  Goodmorning (store name), how ca-

RM: IVE JUST BEEN HUNG UP ON TWICE... TWICE!

Me: *startled* oh..? Okay I'm really sorry abo...
(Having no idea what he was talking about)

RM: I demand to speak to your manager IMMEDIATELY.

Me: Ah, im really sorry she isn't in today I'm afraid, is it something I can help...

RM: WHOS IN CHARGE?!

Me: That would be me today.

RM: How much do you charge for a newspaper bag then?

Me: Well we charge 5p for small bags and 10p for a Bag For Life

RM: WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

(Now I'm at the point where I'm thinking c'mon, it's 5p. I probably walked past 3 5p coins on the floor to work today. So here come the one word responses)

Me: Today.

RM: ..and WHO enforced this? Under who's authority?

Me: That would be our head offices.

RM: THIS IS DISGUSTING... OUTRAGEOUS! IS THIS PERMANANET?!?

Me: Yes.

RM: YES?!? YES?? ...NO NOT ""YES"" I WILL BE WRITING TO YOUR HEAD OFFICES TO COMPAIN *hangup*

This left me feeling so annoyed. Mostly because I was ready to give him the whole ""we encourage ustomers to bring their own bags to help reduce waste"" and ""supermarkets have been charging more for larger bags for years"". So unsatisfying and frustraing not being able to get someone to realise how they're having a moan at staff who can't do anything about it.

raynepuddle,"Next time, I'll let your kids head crack open on the fixture","I worked at small retail store called cozy, that was owned and run by an old Korean couple. I loved working there, my boss was awesome and treated me like her daughter. 

As I said, it was a small store, you couldn't really pass other people between racks without running into one. We obviously had gotten complaints about this before, but not enough to really change it considering how little business we got (besides weekends). Well on this particular day, our store was slightly busier than usual, but still managable. A young mother with two girls comes in, we will call her Distracted Mom (DM). 

Now let me just start off by saying, I adore when kids come into the store. I love to play with them and give them stickers. I've always gotten along well with children. Well these two were running all over the store, and playing with our very expensive mannequin. I very politely ask them not to do so, and go back to my station. Meanwhile DM isn't paying attention except for giving me a dirty look for walking up to her kids. 

Ten minutes go by, and her kids are still running round, running into people, knocking things over. Once again I ask them to stop. To which DM gives me a look that was straight from Hades, and goes back to shopping. 

Well her kids still don't stop, and the eldest was beginning to tug on the younger dress, causing her to fall backwards while running. Anyone who has been shopping, know that retail stores aren't child proof. There are way too many fixtures to get hurt on, so  I hurry over and say 

""Hey girls, I'm sorry but I can't have you running around like that. You could get hurt! Could you go stay by your mommy?"" 

They quickly run to mom, who suddenly looks over and charges at me. I have some social anxiety, especially with confrontation so I'm usually a sweetheart to avoid problems. 

DM: ""I will NOT shop here with someone as judgemental and rude as you! You know the owner is actually really nice!""(if Annie  ((Korean owner and my close friend)) had been there she would have thrown her and her children out of the store. 

Me:""I'm so sorry ma'am, I just don't want them to end up hurt on one of our fixtures. I apologize if I upset you"" 

DM: "" Well why don't you have kids, then you will actually understand Children! Don't tell my kids what to do ever!"" She storms out of the store, kids chasing after. 

Little did she know, that my husband and I had been trying for 3 years, with no success.

dustindps,Old man stealing,"So this happened one day at my electronics store.


I work in south Florida, so we have plenty of old people. You'd think we'd have less shoplifting because of an older generation with money right? You would be wrong.


Our asset protection guys watch cameras and greet people as they enter the store. This is to show that we **HAVE** security and they are watching you. This alone is supposed to deter people from shoplifting. We have cameras pointing near the entrance to the bathrooms because, if you've worked retail, that is the place where shoplifters open the product, flush the packaging, and shove the merch down their pants.


On this day we see an old man walk into the bathroom with a pair of earbuds with spider wrap on them (security wrap that can be opened with a magnet). Moments later he's out and *gasp* no beats in his hands.


So asset protection calls this out on the radio and every salesperson in the store tails him. He gets the idea and he decides its time to leave. Now- this next part is not really... legal? But it happened.


Another associate (not me) with a military tough guy background decides to step in front of the customer while he's trying to exit, asking him for the product. When he denies he turns around and locks the doors to the exit. Again, I would have let him walk, but I was just an observer in this.


Asset protection asks the old man to step into the office and finds that he had a magnet key for the spider wrap and the earbuds. We call the police. Moments later, they arrive. They're usually not too far from our store because they're there quite often.


The man proceeds to have a heart attack and goes unresponsive. Making a loud ""ARRRGGHHH"" as he falls to the ground and passes out. Now, before you downvote me being unsympathetic to this man, paramedics arrive, check his vitals and see that he is perfectly fine. But he refuses to open his eyes. He's put on a stretcher, cuffed to it, and taken to the emergency room.


Typically this would be the end of the story, but it just so happens a co-worker who used to work at my store and left to work for this hospital ER had this guy come in. In fact, he helped him get settled into a room. He texts one of my co-workers asking ""Why do I have an old man in my ER who shoplifted from &lt;&lt;store name&gt;&gt;?.""


Apparently, he was still unconscious until they tried to put in a catheter. To which, by some miracle, he recovered from his heart attack and was in perfect health.

xCtrldChaosx,We’re Not Open Yet Lady,"Back in high school I was part of a team that helped set up a brand new hardware store in my small hometown.

The construction of the store was about 90% finished. We were in the process of setting up and stocking shelves, creating isle ways and generally planning the layout of the store.

During this time: Only about half of the light fixtures were ever running at a time in order to save money during construction. Even though there were checkout lanes constructed, the registers were not yet installed. The only way to enter the building was to manually push open the automatic sliding glass doors in the front of the store. Nobody was required to wear any sort of store uniform. Absolutely nothing about the appearance of this store would hint that we were open for business.

So one day I’m stocking some shelves in the home and garden department and I’m approached by a lady I didn’t recognize. We’ll refer to this lady as “OL” for “Oblivious Lady.” She was carrying a few boxes of stuff in her arms (because we had no carts yet).

OL: “Where is the camping section?” 

Figuring she was just another new employee, I made a small introduction before pointing her to the general location of our camping section.

OL: “Do you mind walking with me, I get lost easily” (in hindsight this should have been my first clue something wasn’t right).

On the way there, I noticed that the boxes she was carrying did not belong in the camping section.

Me: “Actually, I think that hot plate belongs in the appliances section...”

OL: “Yeah, that’s where I got it from.”

Me: “Ok... why are you moving it to the camping section?”

OL: “I’m not. I need this stuff for a camping trip.”

Me: “Is [manager] ok with that?”

OL: “Who’s that?”

Me: “Wait. You work here right?”

OL: “No, I’m shopping for stuff for my camping trip.”

Me: “We’re not open for business yet.”

OL: “But I need this stuff!”

Me: “I don’t think you understand. We have no way to sell any of this stuff to you. The grand opening isn’t for another week.”

OL: “I’ve been shopping around for a half hour and nobody told me you weren’t open. I need this stuff and you’re telling me I can’t purchase it?”

Me: “That’s correct.”

OL: “How Rude!”

Me: *laughing* “Hold on, let me get my manager.”

I grab my manager from his office and tell him the story. We find the lady in the camping section pulling items off the barely stocked shelf.

Manager: “Um... I’m sorry ma’am. I’m going to have to ask you to leave. This store isn’t open for business yet and you’re trespassing on our property.”

OL: “I’m just trying to buy stuff for my camping trip!”

We finally had to walk her to the front of the store and point out that the registers were not even installed. Then we walked her to the sliding glass doors, pushed them open and told her to have a nice day.

Tl;dr: Lady manually pushed open the sliding glass doors to gain access to a store that was not yet open. Shopped around for a half hour before anyone told her the store wasn’t open yet despite obvious signs the store was still under construction.

**Me:** Unfortunately, I canno-

**OL:** Go get your manager.

[I went to get my manager, tells me and her the same thing. She calls her other friend, and her friend lets her use her email. As she's writing it down, she's complaining.]

**OL:** Hi [friend name here], I'm trying to get a new phone, but this young person just doesn't want to work with me.

**Me:** -standing in silence, waiting for her to finish-

[We get it started, I go through it pretty quickly and answer her questions if she has any. I try to stay calm, even though she was beginning to irritate me. She's standing next to me behind my desk, and standing in front of my printer. I needed to get the papers she needed to sign.]

**Me:** Excuse me, I just need access to the printer.

**OL:** *Wow*. -moves aside-

[I continue to have her sign things, and activating her phone. I put the battery in her flip phone and start it up. It was my first time actually activating one of these because no one in this store has bought a flip phone or asked for one when I started working till now. I closed the back of the phone and turned the screw in the back until it no longer moved. It didn't feel or look like it still open, so I handed it to her.]

**OL:** It's still open.

**Me:** My apologies, -tries to close it more, it doesn't budge- Here you go

**OL:** ...This is still open!! You're being *so* rude to me!

**Me:** I apologize. How am I being rude?

**OL:** You didn't close this properly!!

**Me:** I'm sorry, it's my first time handling that particular phone. Let me close it fully for you.

**OL:** You know, you're so rude. You don't smile, and you have an attitude!! You shouldn't work here! You're being so rude to me!

**Me:** I'm sorry ma'am, I don't intend to be rude. I am trying to be as polite as possible for you. Here is your phone back.

**OL:** I guess you just must be tired.

**Me:** I suppose so. It's the end of my 8 hour shift.

**OL:** Yeah, well I work in a place MUCH worse than this for 8 hours, AND I'M ALWAYS SMILING. You're too young to be this angry!!

**Me:** -finishes her contracts- One moment, I need to find a pen. 

[I went to a coworker for one so she can sign the rest of the papers. As I was coming back, the friend she was with looks at me and gives me the 'She's crazy' gesture. I wasn't sure how to respond, but I'm guessing this means even her friend knew she was being unfriendly?? There was a pen on the desk. I just used my coworkers cause it was already in my hands. We finish the transaction.]

**Me:** Here's your pen back. Here is your phone, and the papers in a bag.

**OL:** That pen is for you! It's a gift *cause you need it*.

**Me:** Have a nice day!

And then she left, and I could finally clock out. Then, I screamed in my car.

**TL;DR:** Old lady thinks I'm rude for not smiling and being tired. Also, ""I have it worse than you, so you shouldn't be angry.""",TalesFromRetail,1362,1523159795

A few days ago, I told you guys a store my coworker shared with me about people not being able to do math right. So, two nights ago, I’m watching the self checkout and this couple is ringing stuff up. They’re doing ok, no errors or anything yet, but I notice they’re just standing there, staring at the screen. I walk over to see what’s up. I’ll be me and customer is C.  
  
&gt;Me: What’s up? Everything okay?  
C: Sorta. These chips are supposed to be 2 for $4.00. I don’t think they’re showing up.  
Me: okay, well, let’s look. Did you put in your discou......  
  
I look at the screen, expecting them not to have put in the discount card. Nope. That’s not the issue. The chips are already ringing up at $2.00 each. They’ve only rung up 2 containers of chips so far. I look at the guy ringing the stuff up, then at the screen, then back at the guy.  
  
&gt;C: So, why isn’t it ringing up right?  
Me: uh.... it is.  
C: No it isn’t.  
Me: I’m pretty sure it is. $2 plus $2 is $4 dollars.

M- Me

C- Hello. I need you to not put too many shirts in each bag or else it will get all crinkley. 
M- Not a problem. There are large bags, I can fit quite a few shirts in each bag neatly. 
C- Yeah but don’t put more than 3 shirts in each bag. 


So I start removing hangers from all of the shirts and my coworker (K) comes over and starts talking to me. I engage in the conversation but never look away from removing the hangers. After about 15 seconds of conversation, she goes to him: 

C- Can you not talk to her when she’s working?

K- ...What?

C- You need to stop talking to her so she can work. 


K starts laughing and just walks away. I don’t say a word, but now I’m so angry. She continues with her specific demands of how she wants things bagged. 

C- Double bag that shampoo for me. 

M- Sure. 

C- Don’t put the white clothes in the same bag as the colored clothes. It HAS to be separate. 

M- ...Okay. 

Then I hear my manager (J) talking to another coworker, and he comes up to my register and says, 

J- “Right, Shewalksinbeauty13?” 

And i can’t resist, I know it’s gonna start something but I have to say to him:

M- Sorry J, I’m not allowed to talk to employees because it stops me from doing my job. 

C- NOW THATS NOT WHAT I SAID-

And my manager is the type to talk back to customers. He’s not afraid of them. So he goes:
J-Why can’t I talk to my employee? I have every right to talk to them and they have every right to talk to me. 

C- No but the other guy was talking to her and she needed to work!

J-Was she not working when he was talking to her?

C- No, she was but-

J- Then what’s the problem? 

C-Never mind. That’s not how it went. 

So J walks away and we continue the transaction in silence aside from her mumbling at me “That’s not how it went and you know it..”

And when the transaction was finished I watched her go up to my manager and try to explain herself again, i rolled my eyes and took my next customer.

AmeKreed,Grandma Theft Auto,"This happened a couple days ago. I work at a family-owned pharmacy that caters to elderly and disabled folk. We sell durable medical equipment in my department (scooters, wheelchairs, etc). My boss asked me to come in to work that day to cover for another employee. I'm a broke postgrad nugget so I went in for overtime. I had no idea what I was in for when I walked in.

About two hours into my shift, a tall customer who looks like she is in her 70s is escorted from the pharmacy at the back of the store into our department because she is having difficulty walking. We will call her Patricia. My coworker -- we'll call her Teddy today; she is an 80 year old 5'3"" badass--assists this woman in sitting down on one of our scooters so they can look at canes and walkers together.

P: Oh...I had a scooter like this before... could I take it to the store down the street and then bring it back?

This isn't too unusual. We're in a little strip mall type complex and we encourage people to try out our equipment like this so they get what they want (and they don't return it).

T: ...Uh... well...yes, but company policy would require me to take your card information until it was brought back.

Note: This scooter is over a thousand dollars. That Teddy is being this generous is awesome, but we're known for our customer service.

P: Oh that's fine.

She hands over her credit card, and gives Teddy her umbrella and the cane she's planning on purchasing and takes the scooter out.

Teddy watches her leave the store before looking down at the card. Her mouth falls open.

Me: What?

T: -in a hushed tone- This is Patricia [last name].

Note: I have heard of this lady before, but I'm too new to have met her. I thought she was dead until she ordered a scooter over the phone the week prior. She is a notorious alcoholic and she's bought 3 or 4 scooters from the store before...because she'd drive to a bar, get hammered, then forget her scooter. We've basically picked up and rented out and resold her scooters who knows how many times.

Me: Didn't she buy a scooter from us this month?

T: Yes, and it's here. We keep trying to deliver it but she won't answer the door.

She looks again at the card in complete shock

T: I didn't even recognize her!

Teddy suddenly gets really nervous. This is a lady who has seen just about everything (i.e. the type of woman who says: ""sir I don't know what catheter you need because I don't know how big your penis is"" in the blink of an eye).

T: Can you check and see if you can see her? She went down this way? I need to call [coworker of ours]

I go out there to look, and the other guy on shift - we'll call him Dale -- is already down on the corner and coming back up.

Dale: She took off this price tag. She's gone in the liquor store.

T: Keep an eye on her. I have to call [coworker] to follow her.

Once she comes in side, I'm kind of in awe.

Me: What's going on?

Before Teddy can even answer, Dale comes back in

Dale: She's on the other side of the interstate with a gallon of whiskey in her hand.

Teddy: Yeah, she's heading home.

Me: ...Uh ... so what're we going to do about that?

Teddy: Oh I called [coworker]. He's going to go back to her house and get it.

This woman says this so casually...I just kind of stare at her.

Me: ...Why not just...call the cops?

T: We'll get it done before they get here.

Our coworker that was sent on his boozy fetch quest soon returns on the scooter and just stops and sighs.

T: How'd that go?

Fetch quest bro: I had to sit behind her in a Carl's Jr. drive-thru before I could do anything. I couldn't just kick her off if she can't walk.

We look in the scooter basket.

Bro got himself a burger.

T: Did she go home?

FQB: Yeah. She was halfway through the bottle when I got there. I talked to her and got it back. She's probably passed out by now. Apparently she just got out of jail.

Me:

Dale: Welp.

Me: -what is this job-

FQB: You guys want some fries?

Heck yeah I want fries.

Teddy finally looks at me and says: The worst part is... I was the person helping her the last time she stole a scooter.

My last customer had $$18.20 in merchandise and she hands me a $100 bill. Ugh. It was earlier in the day so the tills do not have large denominations yet.

I collected 5s and 1s and told the customer after I closed the till that she’d have a lot of change now! Well she didn’t take that well, “I don’t like $5 bills - can you give me $20s?” I told her I already closed the till and the transaction was over, so to do that we’d have to move registers, refund the whole transaction, redo the transaction (plus a bunch of big discounts I had manually done the first time for coupons) to then hopefully get 20s there. Clearly not phased she said yes she wants to do that, she can’t stand 5s and 10s.

preciouspiper,The guy that tried to walk out with seven shoe boxes without paying.,"Okay, so this one is a fresh one. This happened the other day after I clocked out at work. Our store is very prone to theft, and it are always the same people. Most of the people are crackheads that resell them. 


(crack is a big drug problem in this area, had same-ish weird encounterments when I worked at the hotel) 



A co worker, a manager and me just walked out of the back office (where also our back door for customers is located) and literally walk in to a guy holding **SEVEN** Nike and Adidas shoe boxes, ready to walk out the door. We always bag our products, so this definitely smells fishy. As I look at the guy, I remember him from last month - trying to do the same thing. DC stands for Dumb Crackhead;



&gt;Manager: ***stops him*** Sir? Do you have a receipt to show?

&gt;DC: Uhhh, yea no I don't think the cashier gave me one.

&gt;Co worker: Hm weird, ***while she just opens a box that he sat on a shelf***, the tag is still on here.

&gt;Manager: Check the rest of the boxes.

&gt;DC: Uh so uh, I paid for them. I have no clue what happened.

&gt;Me: Oh, well, can you tell me which register you were helped at? I can find out who forgot to take those tags off! But we always bag our products.

&gt;DC: ***gets really nervous***, Well uh, I don't uh, know. 

&gt;Manager: You don't know what register you were helped at?

&gt;DC: I swear I paid for them!

&gt;Me: Okay, if you say so. ***Holds open the door*** Go ahead, walk outside. 




*We have a strict policy on just letting thieves go, even though I enjoy making them very nervous. At this point I had a little idea to find out if he would chicken out his attempted theft*




&gt;Me: You can go ahead, Sir. Take them with you, if you want.

&gt;DC: Uh what?

&gt;Me: Go ahead. Leave the store with them, I am holding the door for you.
 
&gt;DC: So- I won't get in trouble if I do?

&gt;Me: I don't know, Sir. You will have to find out the moment you walk out the door. 

&gt;DC: **grabs all shoe boxes and walks out**, So, no cops?

&gt;Me: No clue. You will find out the moment you decide to walk out.




At this point he just walks out and fast walks to this car while I dial my husband on the phone. To him, it most likely looks like I am calling the police. I just stand by the door while my eyes follow the dude to his car. He keeps looking at me and I am talking to my husband. Not even ten seconds later, the dude walks back with all the shoes and drops them by my feet.




&gt;DC: Are you calling the cops?

&gt;Me: Yes, sir, I am. Would you like to say hi to them?



He gets out as fast as he can, leaving the shoes behind and instead of walking to this car, he walks out of the parking lot into a antique shop while eyeing me while I get the boxes back in the store.




Now, yes, I normally have to let them go. And sometimes I try not to care, but it's still my store and sure as hell, you are not getting out with so much if I have the chance to intimidate you a little. My managers laughed so hard (In the mean time another one joined) and I keep hearing his kind-of-scared voice ""Am I going to be in trouble?""

ohmygodwhyme,"Lady, you can’t get a discount on something we watched you break","First time poster &amp; on mobile blahblahblah 

I work at a rather popular thrift store that sells a lot of things really cheap, especially if it isn’t clothes. Anything expensive we do get normally goes straight to the online store. Anyways, this happened about a week ago and it left me speechless. 

A lady comes in, I’ll call her L, and I will be M. She instantly starts grabbing things and asking for better deals, I tell her I can’t do that because they’re as low as they can possibly be, she keeps browsing and things seem good. Until I hear a loud banging from the back of the store. 

I look over and it’s L SMASHING CANDLEHOLDERS. Mind you, they are only $2 each and really nice looking so why would someone destroy them to get a better price? I leave her alone because she’s right below a security camera and call up my boss(B). Now, this bitch had the audacity to smash these right infront of me, what kind of discount could she want on something’s that’s $4 in total? 

L: Heyyyyy.... so these candle holders are um haha really really broken! I love them so much though and my husband has super glue at home so do you think I could just get them for free?
M: No. 
L: (Clearly shocked) But they’re broken?! No one else is going to buy them? 

Thankfully my boss comes back at this time and asks what’s going on and L goes on about how awful and unfair I’m being and how we shouldn’t put broken product on shelves at such a “high price”. My boss is hardly of the mindset of “the customer is always right” so I cut in. 

M: I heard you and saw you break them, I’m the one who puts things up in the aisle and they were not in that condition when I put them up there. 
L: How can you lie like that? Just to earn a few dollars! (OH MY GOD IF ITS ONLY A FEW DOLLARS THEN DONT BREAK IT AND BUY IT AT NORMAL PRICE!!) 
B: Ma’am if my employee is telling the truth, and I believe she is, you would be breaking it right infront of a camera so follow me and we can check the footage. 

Her face instantly becomes 5x redder and she pulls out a $5, sets it down, and leaves without the candles. We check the footage and of course I’m right. I don’t understand this lady’s motives but she wasn’t even the worst encounter I’ve had in retail. I need a better job.

yourgirlalex,"""I don't want it to be fixed, I want a new one!""","Backstory: I work for a high end brand that specializes in handbags. All of our bags come with a 1 year warranty which means that if anything happens to it, we can send it off to be fixed free of charge. It just typically takes about 4-6 weeks.

So, this woman comes in today with a bag she bought less than 5 months ago complaining that it's ""falling apart"" when it just had a few issues with the handles. The bag she had was made out of a thinner leather lined with suede and one of my managers has the exact same one; in fact, she's had it for over a year and it's suffered zero damage, despite her putting a LOT of things into it. So, my best guess was that this woman wasn't taking very good care of it for it to start tearing that quickly. 

W = Woman
M = My manager

My manager tells her about the warranty and begins to look her up in the system to make sure it's covered (as in, she purchased it within a year) and she had.

&gt;M : ""So it looks like you're covered under our 1 year warranty so we can have this fixed for you.

&gt;W : ""How long will it take to be fixed?""

&gt;M : ""We have to ship it out to our warehouse, it typically takes 4-6 weeks.""

&gt;W: ""I shouldn't have to wait that long if it's just going to rip again.""

My manager goes on to explain that it's free of charge and it *might* not even take that long, that's just the standard amount of time.

&gt;W :""I buy a LOT of designer brands and this is the ONLY one that has done this to me. I want a new one of these.""

My manager goes on to explain that the style of bag she has is from a now retired collection and we don't have it anymore, but, she locates one randomly in a store across the country.


&gt;M: ""I found one at a store in _______ I'll be happy to call them for you and see if we can get it from there""

&gt;W :""No, just forget it. I can tell you I'll never buy another purse from here again.""

She continued to bicker, saying how it was 'ridiculous' and how she shouldn't be expected to wait after 'how much money' she spent (even though she got it on a sale) just for it to break on her.

nodnarb232001,I just had to explain to an adult how quarters work.,"This just happened. 

Drive thru, taking cash, providing adequate customer service, flirting with old ladies; that's my day.

Enter Quarter-Brain, reasoning for the namesake shall soon be readily apparent.

QB- Do you take those Quarter-Dollars?

I'm a bit perplexed by this. Was she referring to the Dollar coins that are roughly the size of a quarter? Did the US mint put out a new Dollar? What...

She then hands me a quarter. A regular quarter. One of the state quarters. Kentucky to be exact. These are, and have always been, worth 25 cents. There is nothing special about them currency wise. They also have ""QUARTER DOLLAR"" emblazoned on the front. I can understand a 1st Grader getting tripped up by the wording but this was a fully grown, adult, woman.

QB- That's worth a dollar, right?  
Me- No, this is a quarter.  
QB- But why does it say Quarter Dollar on it?

Now, dear reader, you may be wondering if she was simply fucking with me? I assure you she was not. There was no trace of irony, sarcasm, or humor in her voice. She was seriously asking me why a quarter was called a quarter.

Me, completely serious, as if I were a teacher addressing a student- It's called a quater dollar because its value is equal to one quarter of a dollar. Twenty-five cents.

She looks at me with skepticism, then her quarters, and I come to the realization that I an watching a grown-ass adult come to the conclusion that ""Quarter Dollar"" literally means ""Quarter of a dollar"". She then begins to ask about Half Dollar coins but stops herself mid sentence, hopefully from realizing that she was well on her way towards proving the criticisms of the US Education System correct.

Now, here's where it's confirmed that at no point was this some elaborate joke. She considers the money she has. It's mostly quarters. She has me remove items from her order upon concluding, after learning that quarters are, in fact, not dollars, she does not have enough money.

PL apparently can’t be bothered to wait 15 seconds while I bag her biscotti and goes across the aisle to begin a new transaction at their stand. 

I’m left there waiting for her for a solid 5 minutes (could’ve completed her transactions like 3 times in that span) when another customer approaches the counter and politely orders himself a muffin.  I bag it and as I begin to charge him, PL is finally ready to pay for her biscotti. 


Me: (To the 2nd customer) That’ll be 2.50 please. 

PL: *Rushes over, clearly upset* Um, excuse me? I was waiting. 

Me: Actually miss, I was waiting. You left in the middle of a transaction.

SamuraiJack365,Customer comes in just to praise us,"This is gonna be short but it made me happy so I wanted to share. Disclaimer: on mobile

I work in a large chain pharmacy. Today we had a customer come in through our drive through. I had been on the window but I was starting to walk away and my manager took over so I could grab something for her that she had trouble getting. Before I could she opened the window and he hands her a big thing of smallish York peppermint patties.

Manager: what's this for?

Customer: for doing such a great job

M: oh, well thank you! Are you picking anything up?

raider2518,"""Send me my check back""","I work at a paint and carpet company, and part of my job is visiting people's homes to measure their windows for custom window treatments. This happened last week at my most recent house call.

I measured one window over stairs, which was inconvenient because I have to work around the stairs. The customer, let's call her Jill, mentioned how difficult it is to wash that window due to its location. So difficult, in fact, that the window hasn’t been washed in years. I agreed with her, considering I was barely able to get proper measurements because of the awkward angle. After commiserating with her for a few more minutes, I finished up the appointment and sent her a quote for the new shade later that day.

The next day (my day off) she stops in to drop off a check and a check to order the shade. But, she had written on the contract “[signed] with the understanding that the windows are cleaned when the installation takes place.” OK first problem: as a general rule, our installers don't wash windows. Second problem: even if they did, a customer can't just write in an extra line item on a contract and expect to not be charged for extra labor. Third problem: windows? Plural? What other window(s) is she even talking about?

So, when I got back to work the next day I called Jill to tell her that no, our installers will not wash her window since that's not part of his job. I didn’t even get to the other parts before she says, in a supremely pissed off tone, “Well then I'm not ordering. Send me my check back.” 

Looking back on it I think she was trying to call my bluff and make me cave so that I wouldn't lose her order. Sorry lady, I regularly deal with multiple thousand dollar orders, so your $600 window treatment on a window I couldn't even measure properly is not exactly essential. Without remorse, I said “alright then have a good day,” and I hung up. 

Some people.

belf_priest,The one time they turned out to be right 😬,"I work in a very small regional grocery chain that’s known to be very low-traffic and usually dead. Having our rival, and cheaper, chain half a mile down the road doesn’t really help much either.

So one day it was slow as per usual, a couple comes through my line to buy only a few of our indie brand protein bars. They were pretty quiet and didn’t talk much, oh well, sometimes people really aren’t up to socializing.

Not even five minutes after they leave, the girl comes stomping up to the front desk with a fistful of the protein bars, now I can’t really hear what she’s saying to the supervisor but she’s obviously confused about something.

They go off to the side, my supervisor tells me to turn off my light and come over. He hands me a small basket and says, 

“They’re telling me the protein bars they bought were expired, so go check the aisle and find me all the expired bars. Go through every brand”

Now, as I’m walking off with the basket, I’m thinking just great, yet another customer complaining without grounds and wanting to make a scene. I’ve been a frequenter of this sub for about a year now and it’s turned me pretty cynical 😅

I start going through the protein bars and my coworker comes to help me out. At first we find a few oddballs that are within a month of going out of date.

But then we find more. 

And more.

Entire boxes of bars that went bad last year, several of them, and a few even from 2016...(This happened last month btw.)

We pretty much cleared out half the shelves and needed an entire full sizes carriage to deliver the past date bars back to our supervisor, who looked pretty horrified. Even the couple who came in with the original expired bars looked pretty dumbfounded too; eventually they bought fresh bars and left without further issue. 

It just makes me wonder what’s happening to my store, we’ve known for awhile the chain was downsizing with store closures and hour cuts to the cashiers, but now stock isn’t being turned? What does it mean? :/ ",TalesFromRetail,1809,1522167328
jbyrd13,Man attempted to exchange a shirt that was four years old,"Our store had a pretty lax exchange policy. Customers can exchange products even without a tag as long as it’s not worn and you have a receipt. It’s easy for people to get away with it. The return policy is another matter 

Anyways I was busy at the cash register when this guy comes up with a folded white dress shirt. It didn’t have tags and doesn’t look like it’s worn because it’s still folded in the way our store folds it with the cardboard box and pins. But this white shirt looks suspiciously off white and didn’t look like any of our recent styles. He claimed he just bought it and handed me a receipt which did in fact show that he bought a dress shirt. Without the tags we couldn’t confirm if it was this one. 

I decided to call my manager and “ask” him how to make an exchange even though I already knew how. Thankfully he got the hint. He unfolded the shirt and checked inside and there’s a folded tag/flap stitched on the side of the shirt to show what year it was made (didn’t even know they had those). The tag clearly stated 2011. When we told the guy he was clearly embarrassed and walked away with the shirt. Sucks for him but at least he didn’t try to fight us on it so I guess it wasn’t necessarily a negative experience, just a ridiculous one. ",TalesFromRetail,696,1522142829
PleasantBrunch,Old lady tries to return item from a different store,"I used to work in one of many beach shops on a vacation-island. There are several different stores in close range and it’s not unheard of for people to get confused. 

One day, I open up by myself and am folding shirts in the middle of the store. It’s been one hour and it’s extremely slow. A tall, older woman with a fanny pack approached me with broken goggles in one hand and a receipt in the other. 

Lady: Hi, I was just here thirty minutes ago and I purchased these goggles for my grandson. As you can see, they broke instantly and I would very much like my money back. 

Me: May I see the receipt, please?  
(Her receipt is from another store down the street) 

Me: I’m sorry ma’am, but you’re in the wrong building. 

Lady: *No,* I’m not, I was just here.

Me: Please look at the name on your receipt and then look at the name on banner above me. (I gestured upwards) 

She looks up at the banner with our store name on it, and the look on her face was priceless. She said nothing, turned around, and left very quickly.

She needed help with scanning an ID card and having both sides back to back so she can cut it out like a real ID card. I don't know anything about the copy n print centre, however, I do know that my province's ID cards only use 1 font. This ID card was a local one, but used several fonts and had the sloppiest kerning I'd ever seen. I told her I'd have to be right back to check how to do so. I told my manager in the back about it, but she was gone as we came back. Oh well.

SCREAMINGTAMPON,"""Being a decent human being makes me uncomfortable.""","On mobile, so I apologize for mistakes and formating
 
Some context:
I work as a cashier in the retail hell of all retail hells; a US hobby shop that sells an arrange of things from art supplies, crafts, and home decor, ect. The reason why this place is a retail hell is because we don't use scanners. All the prices have to be put in by hand, followed by which department they came from, and discounts, if there are any. (Sales change each week, so we have to memorize the sale products, and what comes from which department, but that's another complaint for another time) Our store is relatively new in our city, and we're closed on Sundays, so Saturdays are always ridiculously busy. Customer wait times is supposed to be between 2-3 minutes, so when you have a customer with a lot of sale items from the same department, you can separate and quantity items together by price, which goes a lot quicker than individually typing out the numbers, department, and discount percentage. Most customers are understanding of this. They don't want to wait longer than they have to, and are aware that they can hold up lines.

BOL = Bitchy Old Lady, but only because Old Lady With A Stick Up Her Ass is a mouthful, even for an abbreviation. 

So, yarn is on sale this week, and this woman comes up to my register with a cart that is literally overflowing with skeins and various other needle art items. Naturally, she wants the needle art items done first, on a separate transaction. As I finish up the first one, which took roughly five minutes, quite a line had piled up behind her so I politely asked if she could help me separate the yarn by price. (Normally I wouldn't ask for help, but this lady had such a massive amount of yarn that I knew it would take forever to either sort through them myself, or ring them up individually.)

BOL: No, I can't do that.

Me: It just makes things go quicker, since I have to put in everything by hand. If you can help me, it'll take half the time. 

BOL reluctantly helps me sort yarn, and says nothing more. I can tell that she's disgruntled. As I'm waiting for her payment to go through I apologized and told her that I wished it could be just as easy as scanning an item but our store is odd like that, and BOL looses her mind and uses the most condescending tone I have ever had the pleasure of hearing come out of a fellow human.

BOL: You know, this is a job, and I don't want to hear you complain about working.

At this point I'm blown away by her sudden change of attitude. I give her a polite but short response, as I've had a very long day and I'm not in the mood to deal with shade.

BOL: I just spent a lot of money here, and I don't need you to make me feel uncomfortable by having me separate yarn while you whine.

I tried explaining that I was simply apologizing, but she doesn't let me get a word in, and starts droning on about something or another. At that point I've tuned her out. I give her a bunch of ""Mhhms"" and ""okays"" and BOL continues to try and rant to me about service. The man behind her had been inching up closer and closer to try and get checked out, as he's been waiting about 15 minutes at this point. BOL doesn't get the message, so I tell her to have a nice day. She blubbers a bit, snidely snaps ""Oh, I will, but-"" and tries to continue ranting, so I turned to the man, greeted him, and started ringing up his items. BOL realizes that she can't hold up the line by going on an hour long tirade and stomps off immediately to ask for a manager.

Maybe I was in the wrong for asking for help, but when you're constantly bitched at by customers and higher ups for taking too long to check people out, you get desperate.


TL;DR: Customer has a metric fuckton of yarn. We have to put in everything manually, and customer gets offended when I make her uncomfortable by asking for help.

IdiotaRandoma,Customer Wants to Swap A Used Battery for a New Battery,"I work in auto parts, and while most transactions are mundane we do get some... oddballs here and there. One night, a gentleman came in saying he needs a battery, and he brought an old one in. I think this is great; I'm gonna net a ~$150 sale and he's already got his core in hand! I see it's one of our batteries, a two year unit, and presume either he wants to warranty it or it's actually going to be his core.

I inquire about it and he said it's a good battery and he's had it about a year and a half, but he doesn't need that one anymore. The unit he brought is a top post unit, and he now needs a side post unit. That's straightforward enough, so I show him our side post units and their prices/warranties. He says ""No, I want to trade this battery for one of those."" This request is, of course, absurd, and I try to be polite in telling him, ""No, you're a moron, buy something or get out,"" but he's not having it. He insists I can take that battery back after 18 months of use and resell it as a new one, and all I've gotta do is give him a new side post unit for it. I ended up having to tell him I can't sell that battery and the best I can give him is either a $5 recycle or $18 core credit on it. He then retorts that if he went to any other [our store] that they would accept that deal, as if I'm somehow going to buy that.

Thankfully, he wasn't rude or anything, but he did get rather offended when I told him I can't trade an old battery for a new one. He ended up leaving without buying anything. I still wonder what possessed him to think that idea wasn't absurd.",TalesFromRetail,1891,1521821671

It is the weekend of the big topsoil sale ($.99/bag IIRC). Anyways, it is springtime and with that comes rainy days. We have the courtesy to load up customers topsoil, etc. for free. For those unfamiliar, the pallets of topsoil stay outside all of the time. No sense in bringing dirt inside a store. Therefore, when it rains, the dirt gets wet (science). That day it was absolutely pouring outside, but people still got their dirt and were happy they didn't have to load it themselves. Queue up a not so smart middle-aged woman (MAW)...

MAW (to cashier): Can I get 10 bags of topsoil please?

Cashier: Sure no problem, I'll radio someone up to help you load it up. (Meanwhile, I am standing near the register anyways so I offered to do it.) 

We both go outside.

Me: (Waiting under the awning because it's pouring and watches a brand new silver BMW 5-series pull up to the pallets of topsoil.) Mumbles to self: ""Well this should be fun."" 

MAW: (Still in car with the window cracked enough so she can talk to me) ""I only want clean topsoil, not those bags right there that are all dirty."" 

Me: ""Mam, it has been downpouring all day, all of these bags are going to be soaked and dirty.

MAW: ""Well I came earlier in the week and there were clean bags.""

Me: ""Well with all of the rain today, the bags have become dirty.

MAW: ""Can you at least check?""

Until very recently, I used to work at a great (imo) store that sold women's clothing and home ware. Occasionally awful interactions come back to haunt me, but my experience with a lady I will call Angry Phone Lady (APL), actively makes me mad.

I was up at registers with another coworker on a slow day, so that we could get some tasking done while still having enough bodies to ring up whatever customers came approached us. The phone rings, and I pick it up with my cheery retail voice. I'll be F.

&gt; [F] Hi, [store] in the [generic] mall, figgy speaking, how may I help?

&gt; [APL] I'm looking for a pair of earrings that you have.

&gt; [F] Ok! Do you have a style number for them or a name I can search them by?

&gt; [APL] They are by [specific brand]. Do you have them?

This is where it immediately starts to fall apart and the words I say to her don't matter anymore. For clarification, we carry many different brands of merchandise in store and on our website, and I have never heard of this brand due to the possibility it is sold only online or in A-volume locations.

&gt; [F] I'm not sure, that brand is unfamiliar to me! Are you on the website? I would love a style number to look it up!

&gt; [APL] They are by [specific brand]! Do you have them or not?

&gt; [F] (keeping up the cheery voice as I die inside) Sorry but we carry a lot of jewelry, and off the top of my head I would only know the in-store ones. It sounds like -

&gt; [APL] They are the black [specific brand] earrings! I would like to order them, it says you have them in stock on the website!

&gt; [F] If you're on the website, would you be able to give me a style number so I can search those for you?

&gt; [APL] The maker is [specific brand], and it should say so on the tag! Just find it and bring it over!

Our store switches most vendor tags to create a uniform and shoppable look. Jewelry is no exception. They all say [store name] on the tag, so knowing the vendor is not possible by just using my two eyeballs. I tell her this. It does not go well.

&gt;[APL] WELL THE BRAND IS [specific brand that haunts my dreams now], and it SHOULD NOT BE so difficult to find the black earrings!!!!!

&gt;[F] Our tags all say [store name], without more specific information I can't really help you, because I don't know our entire inventory.

&gt;[APL, not using her listening ears] WELL WHY DON'T YOU WALK OVER TO WHERE YOU KEEP THE JEWELRY, FIND THE [specific brand] ONES, AND GET BACK ON THE PHONE WITH ME.

&gt;[F, sweating from frustration] Ma'am. I. can. not. do. that. because. I. don't. know. what. earrings. I. am. looking. for. May I have a style number since you are on the website?

&gt;[APL, with a scary normal voice and condescending tone] Oooookay. Well! Thank you soooooo much for all your help today!!!!!!! You have been so helpful!!!!!

&gt;[F back to customer service voice] Oh!! You are soOoOooO welcome!

I hung up on her! I had never done that so I was stressed that I would get in trouble and she would call back -she didn't. I was also SO confused and frustrated that I started to cry and had to go out back to take a breather.

I had a skeezy guy call and try to do some bamboozling yesterday over the phone. He wanted a tv at a price he saw online, so I told him no problem. 

He told me what tv and the price, so I put him on hold and scanned it. Our online price was exactly what our store price is, $398. I told him this. He argued and said he purchased 3 of the TVs over the past month at $329 and wanted that price. He said he’d bring in a screen shot of his phone and his 3 receipts and that I need to match that price. I explained to him that I can’t do that, I can only match the most current online price, and that price is the same as our instore price.  He then got pissed and yelled that I am false advertising and I have to match the price or he will call better business bureau and he’ll sue and yada yada yada.  As he was yelling I scrolled through the app and saw the price of the TV he was talking about. It  was the same tv but it was used and refurnished. I stopped him and told him that. He said yeah, and you’ll match that price.

M: Yes, I recognize you from the nearby doughnut/cookie shop.  IIRC, your shop has a different price for customized cookies.  (I really wanted to say ""isnt the cookies just icing, sugar, eggs and flour?"". But I didn't.)

C: I do, but I want a fancy cake for my daughter's birthday!

M: I understand, but just like the custom cookies, it takes time.

C: ok, I'll just order this design.  But I just don't understand why it's so expensive!

After that I completed the order sheet and she left.  But seriously... ""It's just whipping cream!"" Really?

angeleyesx91,What did I just say??,"Short time lurker, first time poster. 

I work in a retail pharmacy in the retail section. We carry about six brands of vitamins and every week at least two or three of them are on sale buy one get one free. We have a rewards card and you need it to get the sale price. 

This has happened on multiple occasions with many customers trying to buy vitamins on sale. I’ll be M for Me and C for Customer. 

M: Do you have our rewards card for sales and discounts?
C: No
M: Would you like to sign up? It’s free and you need the card to get the sale price. Without it both of these will be full price.
C: No
M: Okay, do you know if anyone in your family has a card whose phone number you could use to get the discount?
C: No
M: Okay, well unfortunately we do not have a store card that I could use for you so these will be full price. Do you still want both of them?
C: Yes

So I ring up both vitamins and the customer pays. I bag their items and hand them their receipt.

Me: Thank you! Have a nice day!
C: *looking at their receipt* ...weren’t the vitamins buy one get one??

Retail_Hell,$1 Per Comic Is Too Much,"So, background: Our thrift store has a second floor, which is basically an upstairs version of ""The Back."" Up until recently, the book storage was an insane mess of canyon sized walls of nothing but boxes of books.... and an itty bitty path between them.

Due to a rearranging of the store and the enlargement of the book section, more books than ever before are hitting the floor and being purchased.

The result? The canyons have been cleared up over the course of the last ~3 months. Shelves have been unearthed. Organization has happened. The itty bitty paths have grown to reasonable walkways amidst stored books. It was then that Person #2 (Person #1 being my Supervisor) uncovered boxes and boxes full of comic books, stashed in protective sleeves. It is unknown how long they have been there, and it is unknown how old they were when someone donated them. Comic fans have probably begun to salivate.

Person #2 has approximately zero cares about even acquiring knowledge about comic books, and there were enough of the things that he felt it was better to slap a uniform price sticker on the whole lot of them and leave them out for comic nerds to pour over. Namely... every... single... comic is $1 a piece. (Retail price marked on the covers is $0.75 - $1... knowledgeable collectors exposit what you will on this... aaand some of you are probably crying right now.)

So yeah, this collection is an exception to the ""look them up and discount them 75%-80%"" standard pricing policy.

Onward to the story!

The night is a typical night; I'm doing last register shift and a couple come up, carrying a box full of comics (approximately 200 count, so $200 worth of comics give or take). It's 15 minutes to close. (Of course!)

&gt;Woman: ""So, yeah, I'm pretty sure none of these are really valuable. So will you take $50 for the lot of them?""

How do I get a bid for lower price for the second week in a row? I must be blessed. First that [""I might have cancer so give me a $75 horse figurine for $20""](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/82ccfr/but_i_might_have_cancer_cant_you_give_me_a/) and now this ""give me this $200 box for $50.""

Lady, this ain't a yard sale, so we don't haggle.

&gt;Me: ""I'm afraid not.""

&gt;Man: *huff puff* ""Is there someone else we can talk to then?""

&gt;Me: ""No, sir. The man who priced these is the only one who can adjust the price and he isn't here today. Anyone currently here will tell you the same answer that I just did.""

&gt;Man: ""Well will he be here tomorrow?""

&gt;Me: *internal sigh* ""Maybe? I'll have to look it up. If you'll give me a minute...""

Man and woman laugh scornfully.

&gt;Man: (very sarcastically) ""What a NICE woman.""

&gt;I look it up, silently whispering, ""Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child unto me....""

&gt;Me: ""Yes. He will be here tomorrow.""

&gt;Man to woman: ""Okay, just pull out a handful to buy tonight and we'll come back for a better deal tomorrow.""

They take the box to the end of the counter and start rifling through it.

It's now 10 minutes to close. My eye is twitching. By Sithis, you had better not go through that box of 200 one by one...

At first, I thought myself blessed, for they selected 8 comics, paid for them and left in short order... Oh how I jinxed myself...

Drawer counting commences, I get a bit of free time while Supervisor double checks our countdown. I know what kinds of people customers are, and I suspiciously seek out the area where the comics are displayed.

5... boxes... of comic books have been spread out over the shelving. 5 boxes, approximately 200 per box... the shelves are CARPETED with comic books.... except for the space where Person #2 had taped a sign asking people to leave the place as organized as they found it.

Irony or just a sick sense of humor?

I yell my rage, making a fellow coworker join me to see the mess, and we hastily gather up the scattered comics and tuck them into the boxes again. They spent an extended amount of time, painstakingly selecting 200 comics out of five boxes that they wanted/thought were valuable, and then tried to argue the price down even further. Exhibits 1 - 1,000 of why I hate people, have been strewn across the shelving.

I rage rant the situation to Supervisor, aka Person #1 who handles books, and she writes a note about how the couple left us a mess and got rude with me and leaves it for Person #2 when he comes in to open the tills the next day.

His idea to handle the nonsense was to remove all the comics for 24 hours then put them back.

*sigh* Really? You couldn't just tell them, ""No,"" and be done with it?

On the plus side, if they did come in the following day, they didn't do anything noteworthy or talk to staff.",TalesFromRetail,973,1521180600
QueenLolth,"If I hold my breath, maybe I’ll pass out before I scream.","I work in grocery, and pretty frequently end up working closing shift which ends at midnight.  It was 11:30, and there were three of us all on the registers working down the quick burst line that formed. An older gentleman comes up to my lane and I do the usual pleasantries. There’s a reusable bag in his cart, that is full of winter gear. Whatever that’s not atypical. I’m trying to get through this transaction as quickly as possible because my IPMs have been pretty low lately. There’s about $50 worth of product in his cart. I start bagging things when he stops me, asking about how much of certain things he bought.  I answer. He then proceeds to ask me to bag each of those items separate from each other. I gave him the benefit of the doubt because they were tomatoes and, you know, they’re pretty delicate.

And then he asks me to triple bag them. 

To be clear, this is 7 tomatoes already bagged in 2 separate produce bags, and bagged in their own plastic grocery sack. I triple up each of the bags because I figure it can’t hurt, it’s probably just the tomatoes. 

It wasn’t just the tomatoes.
It was every single item in his cart. All requiring a minimum of three bags before I could put them away. No item could be bagged together, even if they were the same thing. I went through an entire stack of plastic bags helping this guy. I eventually just started holding my breath so I didn’t tell this guy to just back off and let me do my job and he’s being excessive. Meanwhile the reusable bag in his cart is staring at me, laughing. I can feel my IPMs dropping like a rock. 

I get to the end of this torturous experience when he asks why one of his coupons didn’t work. I told him that one of the products was incorrect, and tell him the product he actually needed. He wanders back off into the store to find it, while I’m digging through dozens of bags looking for the wrong product that he doesn’t want anymore.
When he finally leaves I give my manager behind me the biggest “help me” look I can muster. And then she breaks my soul- he’s a regular, and security actually had to talk to him about coming in at 5 minutes to close. ",TalesFromRetail,697,1521158328

kproe,I met Satan in my grocery store,"Alright. To give a little backstory, I work in a grocery store. And to be honest I'm the only one who enjoys the job. I love people and I'm always laughing and smiling on the job. 

A part of my job description is training new hires to run the cash register. I love it! I'm about to drop a story on y'all that I still laugh at to this day. 

I was training a new girl, just 16, when we got this older lady through our line. She seemed nice. SEEMED nice. She reached us a bottle of soda to open for her as she walked through the line, which seemed like a red flag for crazy considering she wasn't that old. SOOOOOO, we start moving her groceries through the line. More old ladies start gathering behind her as a line starts to form. My new trainee is scanning, I'm bagging the groceries. We get to a natural stopping point on the belt and I give the lady her total. About $75. As soon as I say the words, her face turns cherry red. 

""WHAT?! THAT CAN'T BE POSSIBLE. THERE IS NO WAY IT'S $75!!""

I remain calm and look at the register, the groceries, my trainee. I then realize that we bagged and scanned the next ladies groceries AND NEITHER OF THE LADIES SAID A WORD. The lady next in line put her stuff up there so we assumed they were TOGETHER. 

So I just look at lady #1 and tell her I'm gonna void everything and rescan her items. It was like 10 items so it was literally gonna take 2 mins. No money had been exchanged so it was an extremely simple fix. 

Or so I thought. 

The lady starts screaming, ""OH MY GOD. YOUR TRYING TO MAKE ME PAY FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S GROCERIES. OH MY GOD. I CANT DO THIS. I CANT HANDLE THIS.""

I'm not even exaggerating. This was actually happening. So I tried to calm her down by explaining to her that it wasn't a big deal and we would take care of it in two minutes, all still with a smile. My trainee was almost in tears.

She starts screaming at me again, ""NO! NO YOU CAN'T FIX THIS. IM GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE. OH MY GOD. I CANT BELIEVE YOU'VE DONE THIS. IF YOU HADN'T BEEN IN SUCH A HURRY THIS WOULD'VE NEVER HAPPENED!""

At this point, I have a long line and a broken trainee so I just start unbagging her stuff and rescanning. She still screaming 'oh my God' and then she turns her anger on the lady behind her and says, 'IF SOME PEOPLE DIDNT PUT THEIR GROCERIES UP HERE AND TRY TO MAKE THEM PAY FOR SOMEONE ELSES GROCERIES!"".  

THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED. 

So I'm scrambling now to get her out of my store. As I'm unbagging her stuff she starts shoving the bags of groceries towards me. I'm still smiling and moving as fast as my body can take me. EVENTUALLY I did it. I got her out of my grocery store. Still screaming she would never come back. 

And that's how I met Satan in my grocery store. ",TalesFromRetail,2082,1520976999

A middle aged woman comes in wearing her sunglasses (an instant tell that she was going to be problematic) and asks if we still did the birthday promo. When I tell her that we do, she said she had never gotten the coupon for this year and last years. I get her phone number to look up her information to see if her address was up-to-date or correct.

WorkerBee0403,Ever place a cake order while drunk?,"My first interaction with a drunk customer. This was during or around the Superbowl, so we all just figured they were going hard for the football celebrations.

This woman called in to order a cake around 7pm (bakery closes at 8) the night before she wanted it. It was a super simple design so it wasn't a problem. She sounded drunk, but who am I to judge, just please actually come in for the cake tomorrow. She called back 5 times in the span of an hour to make sure I got the order right and change the color of the icing. She landed on black icing with blue trim. 

Anyways, she came in the next day around 2pm smelling of weed and alcohol. I'm just glad she actually came for it. It's customary to open the box and let them look at the cake before taking it and paying for it. So I do that and she just starts celebrating (jumping up and down and clapping) and telling me what a good job I did and calling me Jessica (not my name, but the name that was given for the cake order) and asking if there's anyone she can talk to to tell them how nice the cake looks. 

I try to tell her I didn't decorate the cake, I just took the order, but she's not having it. She kept saying ""don't sell yourself short, this cake is amazing"" and ""Jessica it's perfect, I love it"" 

I did eventually just go with it and tell her she can speak with customer service up front. Just say the Bakery did a great job since  we're a team back here. ",TalesFromRetail,626,1520867445

cabbage_patch_cunt,"Dumb old man thinks his credit card is considered cash, not credit.","First time posting. I’m a cashier at a major outdoor retailer and I had an older customer that came in this weekend that didn’t know the difference between cash and credit. Our store has a Visa rewards card that lets customers earn in store points by charging to their credit card. At the POS I have to select if they are using points or charging to the Visa. I’ll be “M” and the dumb customer will be “DC”.

M: Alright your total is $22, go ahead and insert your card. Now are you going to use or save your points today?

DC: (Mumbles) Save them, I’m paying cash.

I barely heard the last part about paying cash, so I selected pay with Visa because I figured that’s what he wanted because there would’ve been no point in putting his card in. As the transaction is finalizing he says this....

DC: Did you not hear me I said I was paying cash!

M: I’m sorry sir, I must’ve misunderstood you. I can post-void this transaction, give me just a few seconds. It’s too late to go back.

DC: I’ve never had a problem with this before!

My manager comes over to post-void the transaction and walks away. I ring up his item again.

M: Alright, $22 sir.

He still has his card in his hand and inserts in the chip slot.

M: I thought you were paying cash?

DC: I am.

M: Oh, well you have to charge to your Visa to earn points, since you’re paying cash you won’t be able to earn any points on this purchase.

DC: **Puts his card in front my face and shakes it** THIS is my CASH, this is considered CASH to me.

I’m really confused at this point

M: So do you want to use your points instead then?

DC: No I’m paying CASH!

M: Ok I think we’re having a little miscommunication here.

DC: There is no miscommunication I’ve never had this problem before.

M: So you want to save your points and charge to the Visa then?

DC: Yes!

M: Ok, thats what I did the first time and then you said something was wrong? I’m sorry but I’m just trying to understand what the problem is here. There was no reason to void it then.

He yanks his card out of the machine. I’m confused and a bit frustrated as he is really wasting my time and being a pain in the ass. Customers are piling up behind him.

DC: Whatever I’ll just do this then! **Pulls out two $20 bills.**

M: **Points at the bills then his credit card** Ok this is CASH, and this is CARD.

DC: I’m done arguing with you. Just give me my change.

M: I apologize sir, but I’m just trying to understand what you’re saying. Ok, it’ll be $18 back to ya. 

DC: I told you I’m not going to argue with you.

I hand him his change and he walks off without saying another word.

M: Thank you!

So I guess his original plan was to charge to his Visa card, or “Cash” as he likes to call it, but then he got frustrated with me and decided to use ACTUAL CASH instead. Extreme confusing. Hopefully you all understand this.",TalesFromRetail,2289,1520822339
marigoldheart,"""I dont work here, what do I care?"""," This is my first big post and I'm on mobile So please forgive any typos or formatting issues,  i tried. 

So I work at a car rental company.  Were a pretty small location and we're located in a building with another business.  We also are subcontracted to rent moving trucks through a different company, like uhaul but not. Our buisness sign on the street is really small and kind of added on like an afterthought.  So we're a little hard to find even though we're right on a main road, but we do try to display cars with rent me signs in the windows and have a large sandwich board with all three businesses were associated with directing you into our drive way. Unfortunately the sandwich board and a bright yellow sign in our window are the only thing that lets you know we rent the other companies moving trucks. We also have no parking space to keep these trucks in front, so we have to park what we have back behind the building and they are not visible from the road. This leads to a lot of people being flustered about not being able to find us. Normally people get over it but sometimes they take their frustration out on us and occasionally they like to be compensated.  We get it but our buisness name and address is pretty visible and thats where they direct you to when you book a truck. 

So friday we had two reservations for trucks in the morning. One at 8 and the other at 9, the 8 had not shown up yet but the 9 came in and i was helping them and walking them out to inspect and go over the truck, when the lady with tje 8 am reservation shows up. She's a little p.o. that i dont help her immediately but oh well im in the middle of something.  My co-worker comes in to start her day and gets right to helping her, so she really didnt need to wait long. I finish with my customers as my coworker is checking out the truck to so i get to hear the tail end of their conversation. For simplicity cw will be co-worker and 8L will be the customer. 

Cw- so the truck goes out with a full tank of gas and it just needs to come back with a full tank or [company] charges $8/gallon. 

8L-Im not paying for gas it cost me an hour of moving to find this place and im only going to go 10 miles. 

My co-worker argued a moment but then told 8L that she wouldn't charge for gas if it was over 3/4ths full. The lady also was planning on returning after hours and using our key box. Tje key box is next to our front door so lots of people try to park wherever and ignore all of our assigned parking signs. Its a big mess in the morning and annoying to the other buisness in our building. 

Cw- when you come back please just park the truck in the back of the building and bring the key up to the door as parking thr trucks upfront really inconveniences the buisness next door and theyre open much longer than us. 

8L- okay, i dont work here, what do i care? Thats inconvient to me and i dont have to deal with it. Besides you should park the trucks out there (points to other buisnesses driveway) so that people know where to go. I spent an hour at [buisness in lot next to us] and when i finally got someone to help they acted like they didnt know where you are! (They do, they rent cars from us, they probably didn't like You) You should keep one there permently.  When i come back ill just leave it out there. 

My co-worker and i were kind of in disbelief  and she went out to inspect the vehicle. When my coworker came back in she tried to tell me to remember to not charge for gas when i check it in the next morning but I told her if she parks like an a-hole after she was asked nicely then im charging her every single gallon of gas shes used.  I dont know why people expect to be rewarded for bad behavior and i try not to indulge it as much as possible. Luckily for her she returned in the afternoon to my coworker.

biffybeefa,Lady forgot who I was and I pretended to be another employee,"It was a really busy day today and the shop was absolutely packed. I work in a large clothing/accesory shop that has all different departments-jeans, womens, kids, etc.-and was sent to the girl section to clean and fold, where I didnt know any of the clothes there. This woman calls at me ( well, a loud ""HI THERE YOU"") from the next department.

Her: ""i cant find sizes of this, you go check and I'll be around here"".

Usually if somebody isnt nice I'll just say there's none in stock; its the only way to keep sane at being treated like crap. Today I was in a really bad mood and didnt want to risk sounding snarky so i went off to find the tshirt.

Of course it was actually out of stock. I went back to find the woman, and she had disappeared. I checked both the girls and boys department (theyre beside each other) and just went back to my job; a lot of the time customers will either find somebody else if we take 'too long' or just give up and leave. My supervisor also doesnt like to see us wandering if the shop is busy so the safest bet was to stay in my department.
About five minutes later the woman came back to me.

Her: ""i sent a girl off to the stock room for a tshirt. She hasnt come back. Its been ages"".
Me: ""ah what kinda of tshirt?""

She then described the tshirt and I tried not to laugh because she didnt recognise me. I explained that the tshirt was out of stock. She then ordered me to find the girl and report back to her and to find her, ""i'll be around the shop somewhere"". At this point I just left and wandered round for a bit and went back to work.

shxrylkay,Same customer calls non-stop during a busy shift.,"I used to work at a small local clothing store, it was right before chinese new year so lots of people were coming in and lots of clothing were selling out fast. 

The day before (when I was not on shift), this lady comes in and asks us to reserve a dress for her. Usually, we only reserve items for customers after they’ve paid. (To prevent customers from reserving items only to cancel on them later on.) 

This lady wanted to reserve the last new piece we had. (We have one piece on display, and one new piece left.) She couldnt pay first because she wanted to check with her tailor to see if her issue (waist area is too small) could be fixed before buying. So the girl working that day tells her we’ll reserve for her till 9:30pm that night. We close at 10. (I did not know any of these details yet.)

She didnt come back that night, being a fairly popular piece, someone snatched it up. So only the display piece was left. 

The next day before i could even fully open the store, she calls in. Take note it’s a Sunday - hella busy. There was suppose to be another girl working with me but she was sick and replacement would only be able to reach in an hour.

Lady: Hi, can i check on the item i reserved? My name is [name] and the item is a red polka dotted dress. 

(For reservations we usually put it under the counter. But hers wasnt there.)
Me: Hi sorry, there’s no such item reserved.

Lady: WHAT? Who is this? Who am i speaking to? Is this [name of girl who worked the day before]? I came by yesterday to reserve the dress! 

Me: I’m [name]. I wasn’t working yesterday but i’ll check with the boss and get back to you as soon as possible.

Lady: NO! Why are you asking the boss? The girl who served me is [name]! 

Me: Yes, yes i know but i’m new here and i dont have her number. I’ll have to contact the boss.

Lady: Ok fine! 

I took down her number and told her i’d call her back as soon as the boss gets back to me. Then i finally went to open the shop’s doors. 

Less than 15 minutes later she calls back, asking about the dress again. There were several customers around already, and some were asking about sizes, designs etc. 

Lady: So? Where is my dress? 

Me: Sorry the boss hasnt gotten back to me but-

Lady: THE BOSS? Why are you asking the boss? You should be asking [name]!

Me (internally): oh not this again i just fking explained to you

Me (externally): Once again, i’m new and do not have that girl’s number. However, we still have the display piece for the dress you want. 

Lady: I reserved that dress because i wanted the NEW piece

Me: Sorry about that, i’ll get back to you once the boss replies me

5 minutes later, halfway through serving another customer. SHE CALLS BACK.

Me: Hello, sorry but the shop is a little busy right now and the boss told me the girl that served you yesterday might still be asleep as she hasnt replied. I’ll call you back as soon as she does. 

Lady: What’s taking so long?! You guys should have reserved the item for me. 

Me: sorry, i’ll check why there was this mistake once she replies me.

Like seriously? If i tell you i’ll call you back as soon as i receive a reply, if i dont call you means the person hasnt gotten back to me. You calling me 93632992 times isnt gonna freaking change that.

So when the girl finally replied me and explained to me how she didnt pay and didnt come back by 9:30 i called the lady up to explain.

Me: Hi sorry! I was told the item was only reserved for you till 9;30 and you didnt come back by then. As you have not paid for the item, we unreserved it at that time. Another customer must have bought it.

Lady: EXCUSE ME? I was going to come back but my tailor got back to me late! By the time i went back, your shop would be closed.

Me: Sorry but we only have that display piece left.

Lady: i DONT want the display piece. Please call the other outlet and ask if they have a new piece. 

Me: ok but i’ll have to hang up first and call you back. (We use the shop’s landline for business related calls)

Lady: UGH!

I called, sold out over there too. So that’s what i told the lady.

Lady: ok fine! Reserve the display for me. I’ll come by around 12pm to try it on.

So i did.

At 12ish (pretty busy period but thank god the replacement girl came) she called AGAIN: I’ll be running late. I had to [a long story/excuse on why she had to run home first to change when she was already in the mall where our shop was located earlier]. I’ll be coming down after lunch, please still reserve that dress for me!

So i did.

She finally came in around 2pm. This was when i realised i recognised her from another day (details in comments cause of the ‘one tale per story’ rule)

There was a long queue for the fitting room at this timing. But this lady didnt seem to care. She stayed in the fitting room for 30 minutes trying on ONE dress. She asked me to help her take photos from front/back/side. She asked me if the dress made her look fat. She asked me if the chest area looked too snug. If her tummy was too visible. (Cue sucking in and letting loose.) I just nodded where appropriate and said she looked really pretty. I could tell the people queuing for the fitting rooms were getting annoyed at her. 

When she came out, she asked me to call the other outlet AGAIN to check if we really had no new piece, although i told her i’ve already just checked and they dont. (Truth)

But alas happy ending! She bought that dress on display.

NotTheSharpestCacti,Won't Give It to Me Free? I'm Taking My Business Elsewhere!!,"First time posting, mobile, etc.

I work for a large jewelry chain that is a sister company to [X Jewelry Chain], and as such, even though we sell different things, you can go to stores from either chain and bring in your paper work to have your items serviced, inspected, etc.

So, a couple weeks ago, a couple walks in. I'll be Me, wife will be W, husband will be H, and my store manager will be SM

W: Hi, I got this watch and I got the battery replacement warranty, so I need a new battery.

Me: okay, absolutely! Do you have your paperwork with you?

W: no, we had it replaced at this store three years ago and they gave us a new battery, I didn't think we needed it.

Me: oh okay, that shouldn't be a problem! I can try looking it up in my system! When did y'all purchase it?

W: (looks at husband) it was a retirement gift, so like... Ten years ago?

Me: oh, okay, do you know maybe what month? That would narrow down my search a little bit

W: how am I supposed to remember when it was bought? You're supposed to keep record of it!

Me: we do, but I might have trouble finding it if my search is too broad. And what store was it again, was it this store?

W: (getting more irritated with every question) no, it was from [X jewelry chain], the one in Arizona!

At this point, I'm exhausted. It's hard to find something from before 2010, its hard to find something purchased from our sister company because we use different systems, and it's hard to find something purchased from outside my state because I don't know those store numbers off the top of my head. And she wants me to do all of the above, and isn't cooperating with me. Of course.

Me: okay, I tried to search all stores in the company using the information you provided and nothing's coming up, is there any chance it's under a different name or-

Husband finally speaks up: my god, is it THAT hard? We bought the warranty, just give us the battery!

Me: unfortunately, I have to have proof before giving out free merchandise, and the information your wife has provided hasn't found anything. If you'd like to bring in your paperwork-

W: we don't have anything like that! How am I supposed to have something from 10 years ago! YOUR system should have it.

Me: well, it's first and foremost the responsibility of the guest to keep track of any and all warranty information. Our system is a fallback, however if I can't input all the information necessary, it's not going to pull it up like Google results, especially if it's as you said, something from 10 years ago.

H: This is ridiculous, they did it three years ago! You're just trying to make us pay for a battery! I wanna speak to your manager!

Me: I'm actually the third manager, however if you'd like to speak to my store manager, I can absolutely let her know you have a concern and when she's available she can come speak with you, however she's currently in our bridal section so it might be awhile before she's able to meet with you!

H: we'll wait, we have time.

Me: alrighty, I'll go let her know! 

SM: hey [Cactus] what's up?

Me: they want a free battery but have 0 evidence of a warranty and are mad I won't give them a free battery, so they want you to do something about it, so they're gonna wait for you to finish in bridal.

Manager: uh, yeah no, they can wait but I'll say the exact same thing.

Me: yeah, figured, thanks.

Me (back to guest): so she said that y'all are absolutely free to wait, however without proof of warranty we won't be able to just give you a new battery. 

H: this is absolutely ridiculous! They did it for us three years ago!

Me: I wasn't at this location three years ago, so I can't vouch for who was working, or what process they used, but if they didn't require proof of warranty they would be doing you a disservice. Otherwise anyone could walk in and say they paid for the warranty and get things for free, and that's just not fair to y'all!

H: whatever! I'm gonna go to [X Jewelry Chain 45 minutes away] and maybe they'll be willing to help me! I want your name!

Me: Well I absolutely hope they'll be able to find what I wasn't able to, and my name is [Cactus], spelled [C-a-c-t-u-s]. I hope y'all have a wonderful day!

TLDR: irresponsible couple can't keep track of important documents that we tell people not to lose, gets mad when I can't read their minds about when/where it was bought, and takes their (nonexistent) business elsewhere.

&gt;B: We really don't. If it'll make you feel better though, I will gladly check the freezer.

Normally I do just pop into the freezer right away real quick, even if I know we don't have it. But this guy was being an ass and borderline yelling. Not the worst encounter, but it still irks me. 

I came in early the next day and heard Manager talking to Decorator about mincemeat pies and the guy actually called in to complain about me.

iFerz,I don't talk to servants,"Been lurking here a while and got remembered about a story around 5 years ago. Been in the service business for a while, but that was my retail experience.
In Sweden we have sorts of ""internships"" at school (I was around 15 years at this time) where we get a taste of working. This period I was at national grocery store. This one was located in a smaller town (around 2-3k people live there) and I was stocking the shelves. Every thursday at around 12PM* the elder home lets the elderly out to do some grocery shopping. 

I was stocking the shelves (taking my sweet time since i'm terribly new) and I see an older woman going up and down the shelves trying to find something. Not sure on how to treat customers I simply ask:

&gt; Me: Can I help you with anything? 

&gt; OldLady: No, I don't talk to servants.

The fact that she said no wasn't the issue, but the condensending tone and she called us servants. (I think servant is the correct term, basically the word for old timey ""You're below me and i'm better""). Just wondering how she gets through everyday life if service people are servants for her.

Celtabria,Customer that struggles with maths thinks they know my job better than me,"So I had a old customer approach me and my colleague a few days ago with some plants that are reduced. The display says all plants half price.
She walks up and asks my colleague ""are these £2.78?"". Him being off a different department didn't know so I tell her ""no, they're £2"" (as they were £4 originally and half of 4 equals 2...). 
Anyway she asks again like she's blanking me or something until he repeats what I just said and she seems ok and walks away after thanking him whilst not even looking at me (what the hell?). I tell my colleague that was rude and walk off and carry on with what I'm doing.

Anyway, a bit latter on I sign onto a checkout because we were short on staff and lines were getting big and who approaches but that same woman with more plants.
""These are all £1"" she firmly tells me. No, they were originally £1.50 but since they're half price they're now 75p but seeing as how she was rude before and didn't listen I thought f*ck it, she can pay more and have them at £1 each then. 
Now since my store did the discount on the plants and it wasn't a nationwide thing I had to reduce them down manually, first I would scan the plant, then I would have to manually change the price.
The woman sees me doing this and starts banging on about how the other person just scanned her last plants and didn't have to type anything in. After listening to her rattling on and telling me how to do my job I grew tired of it and said rather firmly ""I know what I'm doing"".
She shut up at that, I finished and she paid. I handed her the receipt and told her to have a good day, nice and polite and she got her last bit in - ""you too, sorry that was sooo hard for you"" in a cutting tone.
I could have reached over and strangled her at that point, I would have invited her round to come show me just how the checkout works (since she knows so better) but next in line happened to be my landlord who's quite a nice guy and I didn't want to come across badly in front of him.
She leaves and my landlord (next in the line) and the people behind him sympathise.

I really don't get what was wrong with her. I think she was one of those thick people that doesn't realise they're stupid but think they're actually smarter than everyone else. She obviously struggles with maths.
I hope she realised she talked her way into paying more for something but somehow I doubt it.
If I see her again with any plants she can have them at full price since I'm in charge of pricing them and she pissed off the wrong guy.

Bentskulls,When your arms are against you,"I'm on mobile so prepare for a struggle.


At the market where I work we sell a thing called poke bowls which is essentially a tasty but expensive combination of spices and sashimi on top of rice. It's a hot item for us and sells rapid fire without fail every day.


Queue a customer in the self checkout lanes, happily buying his $10 single portion poke bowl. He grabs the poke in one hand, receipt in the other and walks towards the trash can to throw away his receipt.


From where I'm standing at the attendant stand next to the trash can I watch in slow motion as he goes to throw the receipt away and in a kind of arm malfunction that I'm sure we've all experienced in some way or another the arm holding the poke lurches forward instead and dumps his fresh new lunch into the trash.


He freezes. I freeze. We both look down into the trash to see his lunch ruined amongst the candy wrappers and paper towels.


""I threw my poke away."" He says


""I saw."" I look at him sympathetically but can't offer much encouragement.


""Can I have another bowl as replacement?""


I called the seafood manager to see if we do anything of the sort to replace for these kind of screwups but he laughed me off and told me to never ask for such things again so I told him sorry, but the situation is tough luck. He sulked off to buy another bowl of lunch, thoroughly defeated. At least he didn't throw a fit!

fatbudgie,Tried to return something he already ate,"Back in high school I worked in the bakery section of an upscale grocery store. This was my very first job, and after a few weeks of working there, a guy in his late 20's came to my counter to order some pastries.

&gt;Me: Hi, how are you doing today?

&gt;Guy: yeah, can I get the tart?

&gt;Me (looking at a showcase with like 20 different tarts): Sure... um which one?

&gt;Guy (*annoyed*): that one (he pokes at the glass and left a fingerprint which was my biggest pet peeve)

&gt;Me: Alright, so the chocolate caramel?

&gt;Guy: what is that? This is not what I ordered.

I look into the box and see a quarter of a tart shell that has clearly been bitten into, almost completely finished. I was new and anxious and wasn't really trained to handle customers like this. So I asked him if we wanted a different one and he said yes, so I put his new choice in a box. I knew I wasn't allowed to give away free stuff, so I thought it was a good move to price it at $1 (it was originally like $3.50), and boy was I wrong.

&gt;Guy (*fuming*): What's the dollar tag for?

sarah_the_intern,Is that how lines work?,"Over the weekend, I pissed off a customer not even 2 hours after my store had opened. I work in a department that sells bread as well as smoothies (and other things as well, but not relevant to the story). 

A young woman came to my counter to order a smoothie, which usually takes 2-3 minutes at most to make. While I was making her smoothie, I saw a woman (maybe in her 50’s) come to the counter. I greeted her and asked what I could get for her. She wanted 2 loaves of bread sliced. In my customer service voice, I informed her it would be just a moment but I would leave the loaves on the counter for her (it’s very common for customers to shop around while they wait for orders). 

The woman decided to stick around at my counter waiting for me to finish with the smoothie, but she was not happy about having to wait for me to finish with the person who was in line before her. Since my back was turned while I made the smoothie, one of my coworkers saw the woman scowling at me and asked if they could help her. The woman blew up about how she needs bread but I’m apparently too busy to help her (as the first customer was waiting next to her for the smoothie).

LorixsTyring,You don't use your car in your office....,"Hello everyone! Obligatory LTL FTP you know the drill.

I figured it was about time to share my own interesting story from my retail days.

This happened about 5 years ago but it stuck with me as one of the oddest encounters with a customer ever. Bit of backstory I worked in a popular office supply store and some of the things we sold was furniture or office chairs. So one of the services we provided was to carry out the customer's purchase to their vehicle but under no circumstance were we ever to take their own belongings (purses, wallets, etc) to the car and ABSOLUTELY we could never take their car keys. It was fairly common for someone to be checking out and try to hand their keys to the associate to go load it in their car while they were at the register; but that was a big no-no.

Anyways it was a pretty slow day, only a few customers walking around the store and up pulls this car right to the front of the store (in the fire lane no less) and in comes this middle aged guy i will now call CD, for car dude. CD steps inside the store, doesn't say anything but just tosses his car keys at me. We aren't suppose to take car keys so I just side step and let them fall on the floor.

&gt;CD: *looking slightly annoyed* ""You missed my keys there...""  
&gt;Me: ""I apologize but we are not allowed to take keys from a customer. How can I help you today?""  
&gt;CD: ""You can tell me where I need to pull into""  
&gt;Me: ""I'm sorry I don't understand""  
&gt;CD: ""My car. Where do I pull in?""  
&gt;Me: *getting ever more confused* ""Did you order a piece of furniture? Or an office chair perhaps?""  
&gt;CD: *gave me a look of ""are you serious?""* I need to know where to pull my car in for service!   

I knew at this point it was going to be a great conversation so I put on my Retail Smile and prepared for the worst.

&gt;Me: ""I'm sorry sir, but we don't service vehicles""  
&gt;CD: *Getting kinda angry at this point* ""But your wall right there says 'Service Center'!""  
&gt;Me: ""That is where we provide print services, for things such as business cards and fliers.""  
&gt;CD: ""Well why does it say 'Service Center' on it if you can't service my car!""  

At this point I'm just shocked and at a loss for words, I feel like I had to glance at my nametag just to make sure I was still working in an office supply store.

&gt;Me: ""I'm sorry sir but we are an office supply.....""  
&gt;CD: *Now in a huff* ""Just forget it! I don't know why I even bothered""  

As he is leaving he just yells into the air

&gt;CD: ""WHAT KIND OF OFFICE SUPPLY STORE DOESN'T HELP ME GET TO MY OFFICE!?!""

Jonandre989,"""The competitor lets me do it!"" ""No, actually, we don't.""","A post by /u/greyhippy reminded me of an incident that happened to me a couple of years back, when an uppity customer got humiliated.

The craft store chain was having its yearly sale on fabric, and the GF and I were in the store checking out what they had, to see what we could use for costuming.  The sale is strictly by the yard, with no lesser amounts sold.  You only need half a yard, that's at full price.  Also, no coupons usable on these sales.  They're not about to give you 20% off of prices which are already 50% off.

While we're there, this woman decides that the store can violate policy.  She needs exactly 4 and a quarter yards of *this* fabric, and 5 and a half yards of *that* fabric, and wants it all at sale prices.  When the saleswoman tells her about the rules on the sale, the woman demands to see the manager.

The manager tells her the exact same thing as the salesperson did, and the woman gets all huffy.  Fine, she'll take the fabric in 5 yards for *this* and 6 yards for *that*, but she wants to use her coupon that she got in the mail like six months ago (and are obviously expired).

When she's told of the second rule, she gets huffy and tries the usual tactic of, ""Well, *your competitor* lets me do that!  And they always honor *their* coupons!""

That's when the woman next to me speaks up.  ""Actually, I'm a manager for *that competitor*, and I can assure you ma'am, we do not honor coupons during sales, nor do we accept expired coupons.""

The uppity customer got beet-red in the face, and just took her cloth to the front to check out, without another word.",TalesFromRetail,4749,1520275298

Again, not really thinking anything of it because I’m hungry as hell. 


Once I was back off break my manager explained to me what happened. 


So a couple came in, somehow got the speaker off the till front without the cashier noticing then took it to the back of the shop. The man then unboxed it while the lady caused a scene of dropping gift bags everywhere.

Besides, the stock only costs us less than a dollar anyways.

'No' I say. 'No, because you have 0 proof that the order was made wrong the first time, 0 proof that you've even been here before, and I remade your stuff for free.'

Today we had a lady come in the store looking to get refunded for her dead chicks. The store's policy is that the person must have a receipt and the dead chicks in hand to get their refund. Well, the woman comes in with both and hands us some drenched little dead chicks which is suspicious to say the least. After we ask her about them, she admits to buying a water bowl for them (a big chick no no) and found them dead in the water bowl.

To set things up, it was about 7pm. She had the closing shift, so she wasn’t going to be leaving until 9:30.

Anyway, so this mom and her daughter (about 10) who was wearing a dress and winter boots walk in and they start browsing the store. No big deal, my sister asked if they needed help. They didn’t, so she just kept sorting receipts or whatever she was doing.

After about 10 minutes... (sister is S, Mom is M, girl is G)

And they continued to browse. Twenty minutes later...

Since my sister was the assistant manager and her best friend was the manager (that’s how my sister got the job) and had known me since I was born, neither of them had any problems letting me in and out of the stock room to use the bathroom or to put things that I wanted in my sister’s “to buy” bin (each employee had a bin that they could fill with things they wanted to buy, and they had a certain amount of time to buy it before it went back on the shelf). And yeah. It was a mess. Total fire safety hazard. There was barely even room for one person to walk around, let alone two or three.*

About 15 minutes later...

&gt; G: mom! I have to go NOW!

&gt; M (to S): just let her use the bathroom!

&gt; S: I am not allowed. I’ll be more than happy to hold onto your stuff while you take her next door, but I cannot let unauthorized persons into the stock room or the bathroom with all of our personal belongings.

&gt; M: but she’s just a child!

&gt; S: even if it is just a child. Can’t do it. I’ll lose my job.

&gt; M: hmph.


And finally, 5 minutes later...

&gt; G: mom! I’m peeing! Oh my god!

&gt; M: oh my god. *why didn’t you go at school?!*


Sure enough, the kid peed herself. All over her dress, all in her boots, and all over the carpet.

The mom paid for her stuff. Then asked my sister for a bag for the car seat.

The first thing my sister did was call our mom and say “so...how does one go about getting pee out of carpet with Lysol...?”",TalesFromRetail,2233,1520062144
yourgirlalex,"""They're being mean to me and not letting me use their bathroom!""","To start off, I work at a high end store at a high end mall. There was a large, private charity event held at my mall today and there were many wealthy people there--many of them left the event very drunk. My store was participating in this event and we had our own display of drinks (non alcoholic) and snacks for customers passing by and this event was for sure to bring much needed traffic to our store.

About near the end of my shift, a group of women I'd say around mid 30s walk in (more like stumble in) and I can tell right away that they're all very intoxicated. They were walking around our store, grabbing our drinks and snacks being extremely loud and belligerent; spilling their drinks everywhere, acting like our store was a party. They all sit down on the floor in the middle of the store (our store is SMALL by the way) and this one woman starts asking where the bathroom is to my co-worker. 

DW: Drunk woman
CW: Co-worker
M: Manager




DW: &gt;""Where is the bathroom? I need to pee!""



CW: &gt; ""We don't have a bathroom, I'm sorry""



DW: &gt; ""You mean...you don't...have a bathroom for me to use? There's no bathroom in here?""




CW: &gt; ""We have a bathroom, but it's a staff only bathroom""




DW: &gt;""I NEED TO GO!"" Mind you, she's slurring her words




CW: &gt; ""Sorry, I can't let you go into our bathroom, customers aren't allowed. There is a bathroom upstairs in the food court.""


DW: &gt; ""WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?? THIS IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE!""


My manager steps in



M: &gt; ""What seems to be the problem?""




DW: &gt; ""YOUR WORKER WON'T LET ME USE YOUR BATHROOM!!!!""



M: &gt; ""Correct, it's staff only.""


Drunk woman then puts her drink down and makes a run for our back stockroom. Another one of my co-workers sees and stops her before she can get into it. Then she makes a run for our other stockroom (mainly a room we use for mailing supplies). We stop her again and tell her she can't use it.


DW then throws her hands in the air and YELLS to her friends ""They're being mean to me and not letting me use their bathroom! This is f*cking INSANE! I should just piss right here!""


M: &gt; ""I'm more than happy to call security and have them escort you out if you'd rather have it that way""

DW turns around at her, screams at her that she refuses to ever step foot in our store again, screams at her friends to not buy anything in our store and they all leave. Finally. They left a huge mess with spilled drinks and smashed food all over the floor, behaving like children. I hope they realized that just because they have money (or they married into it) that it doesn't mean the world stops for them. ",TalesFromRetail,742,1520037297
RandomStranger456123,"Children are not allowed to do that. And Ma’am, you are acting like a child.","Hello TFR! Long time, no see. Some of you may remember my tales from a large grocery chain’s attached gas station, and it’s time for another adventure. So remove your keys from the ignition and stub out those cigarettes, because it’s time to tell a gas station tale!

So as many of you know, children and other unlicensed minors are not permitted to pump gas. Now we usually let this rule slide if mom or dad are there keeping a close eye on the situation. But if we see a very young person pumping gas on their own, we have to stop the pump.

Now usually we can head the inevitable “Why did my pump shut off?!?!???” conversation by asking kids prepaying if their parents are going to pump the gas. This story is one of those cases where it didn’t work so well. 

So, to set the scene. It was a dark and, well, dark night a few days ago. I was just finishing up some cleaning when I saw a person about 10 or 12 at the window (a side note: we have to speak through an intercom because the window is 1/2” lexan for safety). Immediately, I know I have to ask the dreaded question, to which she replies in the affirmative. 

After sending her on her way, I watch through the side window as she tells her mother that she will have to pump, and is then told to pump anyway. Ho boy, one of those. So I go ahead and preemptively stop the pump because at the very least, her mom needs to be watching. Now comes the fun part. After trying in vain for a few seconds to start the pump, daughter tells mom that it isn’t working. Now rather than actually go over and try herself, mom decides to walk about 3x farther to yell at me.  The conversation (M for me, B for, well you know what) went something along the lines of:

&gt;B: Why did my pump shut off?!?!???

&gt;M: Ma’am, you are going to have to pump your gas. Your daughter can’t do it alone.

&gt;B: THAT’S BULLSH*T! MY DAUGHTER IS OLD ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF! SHE IS 11 F**KING YEARS OLD!

&gt;M: Ma’am, children are not allowed to pump gas. And right now you are acting like a child. 


At this point she just started screaming incoherently, so I turned off the intercom and cancelled the ($10) sale. Once she paused for a second to get her breath, I pushed the refund through and said

&gt;Ma’am, I’m refusing this sale. Please leave or I will call the police.


And I turned off the intercom again and went to the back. After a minute of rambling on like a lunatic, she finally got the hint a left. I had a couple days off, so I haven’t heard the fallout yet, but I imaging nothing much came of it. 

Anyway, I hope you haven’t been letting the crazies get under your skin. Keep on truckin’ fellow drones!",TalesFromRetail,1709,1520014392
empathybox,"""... They breathe air?""","Big pet shop employee, specifically in the animal care department. This morning before we opened for retail and I was getting some tasks out of the way a lady stomped up to our fish corner visibly upset. She will be L and I will be Me.


&gt;L: I need twenty-five new goldfish! The fish one of you sold me yesterday ALL DIED overnight! 

&gt;Me: Oh, yikes, I am so sorry to hear that. We haven't experienced any fish loss like that in our system--what did you do with the goldfish when you got home yesterday?

&gt;L: I didn't do anything. My husband was the one who purchased them. We're giving them out to children in my son's class. We took them out of the bag and put them in jars just for a night!

&gt;Me: (faltering) ... Jars. How big--

&gt;L: You know, mason jars! (motions how deadly and tiny they are, especially for goldfish)

&gt;Me: Okay, well, goldfish can't live in those. Did you condition the water before you put them in the jars?

&gt;L: Did I what?

&gt;Me: (Oh, god.) Did you use water conditioner? Did you add anything to your tap to make it safe for the fish, or did you just put them in straight tap water?

&gt;L: Just our faucet water! I didn't know they needed anything like that. We put them in the jars, and...


At this point, I'm slowing down on selling her new fish, because I realize this really isn't fair to the fish and she has a lot of learning to do. I'm willing to educate her, but I'm strongly against ""pets as prizes"" as in general you're thrusting a big responsibility on someone who may have zero clue how to appropriately care for the creature, if they actually give enough of a damn to do so.


We get to a point where she understands that tank size and safe water is vital, and that she must find a way to communicate this to her son's classmates. I also know my manager won't back me on refusing this particular sale of goldfish. So I get the fish bagged, snag the bag shut and tie it off. When I shut the bag, I make a point of providing plenty of air, which makes the bag tight like a balloon, so that the fish can survive the transport. At this, the lady seems bewildered.


&gt;L: Is that enough water?

&gt;Me: Hm? Oh, yes. You need a nice ratio of water to oxygen for the fish while you bring them home.

&gt;L: ... (blank stare)

&gt;Me: (blank stare right back)

&gt;L: They need all of that?

&gt;Me: All of what?

&gt;L: All of that air. They breathe air? (suddenly realizing what is now the most likely explanation to her fishpocalypse) We filled the mason jars to the top and screwed the lids on. 

&gt;Me: ... Oh. Nnnoo.


And so the lesson continued, this time explaining that fish cannot live in sealed systems without aeration. Not just goldfish. But any fish. Especially in tap water. In mason jars.


Instead of speeding through my morning tasks, I rocked this lady's world re: What Fish Literally Need Just to Survive 24 Hours.

llynn1981,I’m sorry we have different policies than our competitors?,"On mobile. 

I worked at a lovely bakery while I was in college. We made everything from scratch, the prices were extremely reasonable, and most of our customers were great, and had shopped there all their lives. It was a mom &amp; pop shop. 

At one point a competitor had to shut down for an extended period of time. I think they had some flood damage or something, and they had to do some extensive repairs and couldn’t open. We had quite a few of their customers come in to get birthday cakes, cookies, etc., since there were only a few bakeries available outside of a chain grocery store or WM.  Most of them were very nice and understood that we didn’t offer the exact items that our competitor did. Some even chose to come back after the competitor reopened. 

There was one woman that did NOT understand.  A young mom pushing a stroller came in one day inquiring about a birthday cake for the adorable cherub in the stroller. She asked about flavors and fillings . When I asked her how she wanted it decorated, it went sideways real quick. 

CL = Crazy lady
M = me

CL: I want the cake carved into the shape of a one and covered in fondant with no buttercream.

M: I’m so sorry, we don’t carve cakes, and we don’t use fondant at all. I can ice a number one on the top in a shade of blue to match your decor, or just about anything else. 

She was visibly getting red as I was talking. She didn’t say anything for about 10 seconds, then she unleashed...

CL: HOW CAN YOU NOT USE FONDANT? [Competitor] USES FONDANT ALL THE TIME! YOU CAN CARVE CAKES, THERES NO REASON YOU CANT!!!1!

M: We don’t make fondant, and the majority of our customers don’t ask for it. We are kind of known for our scratch-made buttercream. It’s really good. 

CL: BUTTERCREAM IS AWFUL! I DON’T WANT MY BABY EATING THAT GARBAGE! *

M: That’s all we use, except chocolate, cream cheese, and German chocolate. And we don’t carve cakes because our cakes are too fragile, you would have a pile of cake crumbs and icing once you got it home. 

She continued ranting for a few minutes, and was so loud that our baker in the back came to check what the noise was. She never did ask for a manager, or ask to speak with someone else, she just yelled at me. 

To his credit, the kid slept through the entire thing. I’m sure he was used to it. 

She finally stopped yelling long enough to stare at me for a second, point in my face and say,

CL: I will NEVER come back here again! You lost a customer today! Worthless!!

I just smiled and told her it was no problem. Have a nice day. 

She angrily marched to our door and struggled to get the stroller through, while giving me a death stare. I just smiled and waved goodbye. 

(*side note, bakers use buttercream to make fondant stick to the cake, but I didn’t say that then.)

AfroRugbyQueen,Became a Math Teacher at Work Today,"On mobile, formatting, y’all get it.
So about two days ago I was ringing up an elderly customer for a couple of items. I work at a popular southern grocery store. She had an issue earlier where she thought an item (blueberries) was less than it was, but that had been resolved (after some...discussion...between her and my coworker) and I voided it from her order. So everything was cool, and I was ready to have her pay.

Me: Your total is 12.42
Her: No...no that’s not right.
Me: Well I took the blueberries off, so everything should be right.
Her: How is it 12?

So at this point she starts doing the math out loud

Her: 2 plus 2 is 4, plus 1.39 is 5.39...

And I was listening and agreeing with her but she would kept stopping with the adding after the first 3 items and repeat:

“No, this isn’t right!”

So I highly doubt the computer is wrong, but I try to help her out. 

I start doing the math out loud as well, and get around 12 dollars, rounding off the amounts. 

We kinda go back and forth just doing addition but for some reason she just...isn’t getting to 12 dollars like I was.

So I physically take out my cell phone and add the total and show her I got 12.42. She still is skeptical.

So I turn to our calculator that prints out what you type and the total. So I type out all the items’ price, and get the same total, show that to her...and she still doesn’t believe me.

At this point I have a line, and I really don’t know how else to explain addition. 

Eventually after two more rounds of her doing spoken addition, she finally pays, and walks away, looking at her receipt. 

 I’ve had people dispute amounts before but...I haven’t had anyone dispute addition lol.",TalesFromRetail,1507,1519817710

This Saturday it was for a new brand of rum and I was set to do two events at two chain booze stores. I am wearing the rum branded shirt and have stickers and coupons to hand out. First store was uneventful (sold 5 bottles though!) and the second store was shaping up to be the same. At the second store I was issued a [lanyard and badge that said ""Vendor"" all over it](https://imgur.com/a/Nie94) which for the most part helped with people not asking me where things are in the store. When I did get asked I would say I that I am not familiar with the store layout but I know where the craft beers and rum are. Most people were very understanding and I told them I would send an employee their way when I saw one.

I work at a small version of a major retailer. Basically, if the larger retailer sells 45,000 products, we sell 25,000 of those (and by the way are expected to know the exact location of every single item by most customers). We went into a shopping complex as a sort of test for the type of store. Sometimes this becomes a problem when someone comes in looking for something the big stores sell but we don't have space for. 

Some customers get angry, but most are understanding. It's been 8 months, most people know the deal now and we're building a pretty consistent customer base. Most people love us because we're easy access and they can pop in and grab what they need without making a massive trip to one of our larger locations. 

Cut to this morning, an older lady comes in to get something cleaning related. It's actually a rather obscure product that we don't stock, but the big retailers do just because they have the shelf space. She comes out via the registers, just to gripe at the 16 year old I have on the main register. He apologises, as we always do when we don't have something.

faerieunderfoot,The day some one tried to commit suicide at my till.,"Couple of obligatory apologies and warnings before I start. I'm using my phone so sorry for the crappy formatting. And trigger warning for descriptions of attempted suicide.

This was a several years ago; working at a major supermarket. I'd just been transferred from the floor onto the tills the month before and was still in the middle of my training. I was also under 18 which meant all alcohol sales had to be authorised by a manager (relevant).

It was a pretty standard day and I was helping  one of my favourite customers pack when I saw a guy, mid 40s very tanned and muscular walk to join my belt with a pile of stuff in his arms.

At this point I wasn't really paying attention, people always pop in for one thing and don't grab a basket then as they go along pick more stuff up. I'd just said good bye to the customer  when I noticed him leaning pretty heavily on the belt.

When I fully turned back to him with the usual ""hello, did you find everything you need  blah blah blah"" the words stopped dead in my mouth. 

He had just thrown about 10 empty packets of paracetamol onto the belt and was trying to pass me one of those mini bottle of white wine, which was also empty.

He'd obviously taken all the painkillers with the wine and was trying to pay for them....

I really wish I could tell you that I stood up and hugged him and talked him down called an ambulance etc but I was 17 and sheltered and all I could think was ""im not old enough to sell him alcohol and I'm not allowed to sell more than 2 lots of any 1 painkiller at a time""

I remember that he was very kind but insistent while I told him that I needed to get my manager to authorise the sale (obviously not what I was doing but not a complete lie because of the alcohol needing approving) kept saying that ""he wasn't a thief"" and wanted to ""pay for everything before he died"" which for a 17 year old (well, for anyone!) was shocking and heart-breaking.

After a minute or so my store manager came over to see what the problem was and took control of the situation leading the man over to a bench nearby calling an ambulance and talking to the man and keeping him calm while it arrived.

I learned later that he had just come back from Afghanistan (hence the tan) and wasn't getting the proper care he deserved for PTSD (also some other things that I don't think I'm allowed/is right to share) and couldn't handle it anymore. 

With the speed the ambulance arrived I'm pretty sure he survived, but no one ever got back to me to say. I hope he is and that things have gotten better for him too.

Sorry for the sad Post but I couldn't think of anywhere else to post it to get it off my mind.

Chicken__Nuggetz,No...I really can't accept that as payment...,"So I was working for a retail store that sold food items when I was about twenty years old (This was about six years ago). This really old guy comes up and he has about $15 in items and hands me two rolls of quarters ($20). Our policy at the time was to take any rolled coins into the back office to weigh them for accuracy.

I explain this and the guy is LIVID, he demands his $5 and will not give up. My manager comes out and explains that it will only take a second. After a minute or two of him yelling he finally throws his hands up and agrees.

We take his two rolls of quarters back and place them on our money counting machine. This thing was just a tiny little machine that could count bills or weigh rolls of change, it was never wrong in my experience. We weigh the rolls of quarters and the machine seems....confused. It says error but we figure there must be a problem with the machine, we pop open the rolls of quarters to do a manual count.

That is when we see it. The items inside are the same shape as quarters but are actually plastic porn tokens. They were silver with the word ""PORN TOKEN"" engraved on them and an address where they can be redeemed.

He was gone before we exited the office. I guess he didn't want his porn tokens back. :c

dexidrone,She learned something today...,"A mom and her child are at self checkout. She's teaching him how to scan and to be honest it was going fine. Then they got to the limes. So now she tries to teach the child how to use the produce lookup function. They start with the pictures and I hear her say to the child, ""Now select the one that says vegetables.""

After initial ""wtf!?"" in my head, I came to assist. I pointed out that limes were fruits but then showed her that it was easier to use the search by name option. After the whole thing she turned to me and said, ""Thank you for your help. I learned something new today!"" I reply, ""Oh that the search by name feature is easier?"" ...

Some background info before I begin: I work for a small local shop. The owners are currently out of town. I'm the closest thing we have to a manager while they're away.  

So this lady comes in to return a product. My coworker is helping her while I'm with another customer. To do any type of return, our system requires a phone number and name. 

CW= co worker 
M = me
CL = crazy lady 
ND= nice dude I was helping 

CW: May I please have a phone number for the return?

CL: No. 

CW: I need a phone number to do a return.

CL: No you don't. Just give me my money back.

CW: I can't do the return without a number. 

CL: You know it's illegal for businesses to ask for personal numbers, right? Do it without my phone number.

CW looks at me like ""what do I do?""

M: Ma'am we have no way of doing a return without a number. Just give us any 10 digit number and you're all set. 

CL: No, it's illegal. Let me speak to the manager. 

M: They aren't here.

CL: So there's no manager available? You've got to be kidding. 

M: I'm in charge while they're gone. I can't do a return without a number. 

CL: Where's the manager? Call the manager!

M: I can't do that. They're at a conference. They'll be back in 2 days.

CL: When does the conference end tonight?

M: I don't know, but calling them isn't going to make our system capable of doing something it can't do.

CL: I'm calling the police! This is ridiculous! I spent a lot of money on this and I was told I could return it if I wanted to, now you're refusing!

M: I'm not refusing, I just need a num- 

CL slams the product on the counter in front of my coworker and storms off

CL: Just keep it all! I'll be back with the police tonight! 

M: Okay

ND: Wow. All she had to do was make up a number. 

She left the product, receipt, and HER CELL PHONE on the counter and drove off.

jacozza,My ego grew 3x that day.,"Hello.

So I manage a small hardware and work the closing shift. It was a particularly long day, dealing with people and their sump pump problems or their drainage issues. You can only explain the basic function of a sump pump so many times before you lose faith in your customers. 

So there I am with my skeleton crew, praying to our Lord and savour (the hour hand of the clock) for the sweet release of our shifts (9 pm). Everything was fine and dandy until 5 mins before closing when a women (ol) in her 60's comes through the door. My cashier and floor hand stare this poor women down with pure disbelief in their eyes. How dare she come to our store 5 mins before close! (The thoughts of my crew)

Realizing what is about to transpire (thinking the women would just walk around, refusing help and stating that she is ""just looking"") I jump into action. 

Me: "" hello, welcome to xxxxx, what are we working on today? "" 

Ol: ""oh hello, I need help getting some hardware for my daughter's bed frame and headboard""

Me:""okay, not a problem, what size hardware do you needed ""

Ol ""I don't know what size they are, its just a bed frame""

Me: ""oh.....okay.... Well how does everything connect together? Bolts through frame to nuts,  threaded inserts...let's see what we are dealing with just to see if we can figure something out.""

Ol: ""I don't know...I don't know how it goes together or how it connects, I don't know what the screws go into, I don't know its just a post, a bed frame and I need to screws for it. Its a metal bedframe, screws don't go all the way through it...""

Info: every customer seems to call screws, bolts and nuts the same thing....""screws""

Me: ""......okay.......so here is what I am going to propose, there are a variety of bolts and screws that can be used for bedframes and headboards, the two most common sizes are 1/4"" and 6mm, however it can also be a 5/16"" or 8mm, and maybe larger, so here is what I want to do. Let me grab you one of everything. I will grab you one of each bolt that is commonly used , to start with, and you can take them home and have your daughter or yourself, try each one of these bolts . from what your describing, sounds as if the bedframe already has some threaded inserts so for now, we won't worry about any nuts. I will go ahead and grab you bolts with different heads on them so you can differentiate which is which and help eliminate any confusion. Once you figure out what hardware you need, bring everything back and we can get you situated with the proper hardware, just show one of my floor guys, or myself, the bolt that fits and we can get you what you need.""

The women kinda just stared at me for a minute as the info that flew out of my mouth found its way into her  head. Eventually she got the message and exclaimed ""wow! That's brilliant! I would of never thought of that, thank you, you are a big help! That will make this a lot easier because to be honest, I have no idea what I am suppose to get.....""

Yadda yadda yadda....she continued to praise the store and myself as I gradually ""pushed"" her up towards the register to check out and leave so we could all go home, from their she continued to praise myself and the store to pleasure of my cashier. When she finally left, the clock hand struck 9, and we were able to close up. The cashier and floor hand started to joke around, saying how she wanted to date me and that I got a new admirer and what not, but it didn't matter to me, my ego was already ballooned from all of the praise I got, they were just jealous haha.

ellabellabean,Sorry for saving you over $1000?,"This happened this morning.

Today, I was working the self checkout at the grocery store I work at. Up came a dad with his three sons, one of whom was an adorable 1-year-old sitting in the cart. Based on the cart load, I figured this was probably gonna take a while so I decided to stop and play peekaboo with the little boy. It was at this point that I noticed he had Down’s syndrome and was also (probably related) wearing a blue hearing aid in his right ear.

After a minute of playing, I got called away. The little boy started throwing his dad’s hat on the floor but was otherwise pretty quiet. A little while later, when his dad and brothers were almost done, I noticed his hearing aid was gone.

&gt; Me: excuse me, sorry, but wasn’t he wearing a hearing aid before?

&gt; Dad *in a how dare you notice my son’s disability tone*: excuse me?

&gt; Me: it’s just, I’m pretty sure I saw him with a hearing aid before, and now it’s gone. Did you take it off or did he throw it?

&gt; Dad *still annoyed*: it’s on his ear.

&gt; Me: it was, but it’s gone now.

So the dad started searching the boy’s snowsuit for the hearing aid. I started looking around on the floor, and the dad eventually saw it behind me...right in the middle of the main aisle, about 2 seconds away from being crunched by a shoe (as it’s a holiday here so the store was pretty packed). He picked it up, proceeded to berate me for noticing and “getting involved” and then paid and left.

Not sure what I was supposed to do instead? I guess next time I’ll let a $1000 device get crunched by a shoe? Seems legit.",TalesFromRetail,811,1519086395
goddamnitcourtney,"""You know how expensive weddings can be!""","I work at a clothing store. A couple weeks ago this woman walked in, followed by three (unbeknownst to me) strangers carrying baskets full of bags of (presumably) returns. She had so many things to return, and a bad back, so she had to ask strangers in the parking lot to help her carry everything. I started praying that she wouldn't end up at my till.

My manager notices her and strikes up a conversation. This woman bought 100 pairs of flip flops and would like to return them. Yes, they've all be worn. Yes, they cost $3 each at the time of purchase. No, she doesn't have the receipt. Our policy is typically 45 days. She purchased them this past May. It is January now.

She freaks out at my manager, saying that she was told in May that there would be no problem returning them. She claims that she called this morning and spoke to a woman on the phone (""her name was... Celia, or maybe Selena?"" there is no one who works with me named that) who assured her it wouldn't be a problem. Eventually, for some reason, my manager gives in and lets her return them, on the condition that her return is for $1 per pair. And guess who is the next available cashier?

It takes me at the very least ten minutes to return every pair. This woman now thinks she's my new best friend, telling me how she bought a pair for everyone going to her sister's beach wedding two nights before, and how romantic it was. And she already spent $300K on the wedding, she may as well try to make up the cost where she can! ""You know how expensive weddings can be!""

After I process her return (for a little under $145, including tax, which seems to be chump change compared to a $300K wedding), I now have to find a spot to hang 100 pairs of worn flip-flops.

By far, my least favorite customer interaction.

My question is, why not let the wedding guests keep their flip flops as mementos? They're so freakin cheap, and besides, we live in a coastal area. Everyone needs a pair of flip flops!",TalesFromRetail,1501,1519011005
retailtherapy6991,"""Do you even know how inconvenient that is to the customer?""","So I was working the register at my store last night, and I don't know what it was but people were just not in the mood to be told to go elsewhere for returns. At my store, we cannot and have never done returns at my register. All returns are handled at customer service, which makes sense, considering if we did returns at my register, we'd always have a constant line and unhappy customers that are just trying to check out. 

So yesterday, I came back from my break and my first customer from my break walks up and explains her entire life story and all the reasons why she's exchanging these shoes, but she had that air about her that said basically, ""Don't argue with me, and if you do there will be hell to pay."" Type attitude. Well she's going on and on and I'm trying to interject politely to tell her where she needs to go to do the exchange (the only time we can do an exchange is when it's literally the same exact product and size, aka same UPC). 

She'll be B, for bitch and I'll be m for me. 

&gt;B: ""So I just need to do a straight across exchange."" 

This was after she had explained everything and I tried to interject. I thought for a minute that she might just have the same shoes, same size and style and everything, because that's what she had brought up. 

&gt;M: ""Oh okay, so these are the same size?"" 

She looked at me all bitchy and goes. 

&gt;B: ""Noooo, this one is a 2 and this one is a 3."" 

I braced myself for impact because I knew she wasn't going to be happy but whatever. 

&gt;M: ""I'm sorry ma'am, I actually can't process this exchange here. Anything that has a different UPC you're trying to exchange for, has to be done at customer service."" 

She looks at the boxes of shoes on the counter, looks up at me, rolls her eyes, sighs heavily for dramatic effect, and goes: 

&gt;B: ""Do you even *know* how inconvenient that is for the customer?"" 

&gt;M: ""Uh, I mean it's really not. What's more inconvenient is the people waiting in line to just check out that have to stand behind someone returning or exchanging something. That's why we have a designated returns desk. All the way over there. Have a good day."" 

She acted all put out and pissed off of course, but I didn't care. People are being way rude lately for nothing at all. I couldn't even imagine getting pissed like that if a worker told me I had to do returns elsewhere, what's the point in that? People will find literally anything to get upset about, I swear!

verdeville,Some people don’t know how life works.,"Some people are just... ugh. I work in a store that sells art supplies, which is super fun for me... most of the time. Usually the people we get are newcomers to certain mediums or local artists who need to order stuff, which I do enjoy helping with. 

Yesterday, a woman came in and browsed our selection with a grumpy pout on her face. I asked if she needed help, she replied no, and I returned to the front to process some orders. My coworker G was working with me. 

Grumpy customer stomps up to the front at this point and speaks directly to G.

“I bought this *clear painting varnish* at your store a week ago, and when I used it on my painting, it came out white! It ruined all my work!”

G apologizes and asks to see the product and the receipt, as you would in any store ever. 

“The can is at home and I lost the receipt.” Customer replies, without a hint of shame. I look at G with a just barely hidden “wtf is she serious.” We can’t refund a product she didn’t bring, least of all without a receipt! 

Customer continues to rage about the loss of her work, and it dawns on me that she wants us to offer to pay for the painting! Without any proof that she even bought something from here! Not to be caught in that trap, I ask her to point out the product on the shelf, which she does while G runs interference. I grab the canister and google it while the woman is getting angry that we can’t do a return without the product, and G is giving her our manager’s phone info. 

I get the info up and am trying to figure out how to relay it without worsening the situation when the customer starts spewing “this is terrible service” and “I’m going to talk to corporate!” at my coworker before stomping out. 

“That was rude.” My coworker sighs, and I lead her to the computer. Then I point at the instructions on the can. 

“It says here to shake before using and test on another surface, otherwise there could be a white residue.”

kiwigeorgia,The Boxing Day discount wasn't enough.,"I had just turned 18 and finished high school and was working as a checkout operator at a popular NZ company that sold a bit of everything, It was boxing day and the store was very busy. 



This store would put green coloured stickers with the discounted price onto the toys and around the toy aisle, they would stick a sign saying ""25% off Toys - Green label only"" or something like that.
There is a self-scan machine at the end of the toy aisle so customers can check the new discounted price - there's no way to miss this self-checker so when a woman and son came up to me wanting to know the price of a nerf gun, I was like ""ok maybe she just didn't know she could self-check the price, instead of lugging it to the other side of the store"".


I scan it through and it comes up as the price of the green sticker on the toy. So I say ""this green sticker here is the price"", she goes on about the 25% off for boxing day, and I mention that the signs say the green stickers are the new discounted price. I could understand her confusion so I wasn't annoyed or anything, the store then became really busy again and she demanded I get my supervisor, so waiting for 5 or so minutes with her son who looked so embarrassed and like he regretted ever asking for the Nerf gun, my supervisor came over and explained exactly what I had said to her and that the price is including the discount. 


She then asks if she can get an extra discount for the hassle (she'd waited 10 mins at this point) we say we cant do that, and she goes off at me about how she didn't like my service, this store, how we dupe people into believing they are getting discounts and that we are doing false advertising and that it should be illegal and we can get fined for it, then mentioning her brother was a lawyer and she knew her rights.



Then she mentioned she would come back into the store tomorrow at 7 am and see if that sign was still up and if it was she'd ring my manager, the store owner, the top owners of this company. Then saying she'd let everyone online know about this ""crime"".



Funny thing was she then purchased the Nerf gun, grabbed it and yanked her son out of the store.



That was my last shift, so I have no idea if she ever came back. ",TalesFromRetail,622,1518867160

The next day his wife shows up to buy it for him.  I make sure she knows it's defective before purchase and is being sold as-is and she says that's the one he wants.  I make her a receipt saying it's defective with no returns.  I also have my return policy posted in 2 places on the walls of my shop saying used items are sold as-is.

They squinted at the summaries on the backs of books, scratched their heads in front of the red &amp; pink sea of cards, &amp; straightened their fancy clothes as they waited in line. They eagerly handed over their credit cards when they reached me, as if I had the power to give them true love with their gift receipts. 

Towards the end of the night, a middle school aged boy got in line.He was tall &amp; lanky, &amp; leaned forward as he quickly scurried to the register, as if he was carrying an oversized backpack &amp; was rushing in a hallway just to be early to his next class. He shifted his weight nervously from foot to foot &amp; gave me a tight lipped smile when he laid down a book of Pablo Neruda love poems &amp; a dainty dragon fly bookmark. ""Ooooh,"" I said ""is there a special someone in your class?"" He briskly shook his head &amp; had to readjust the thick rimmed glasses that slid down his nose. ""Oh no no, these are for my mom.

I want her to come in &amp; get whatever she wants."" At this point, my eyes are watering at the sweetness of it all as I scan his choices. 

The poems &amp; bookmark end up totaling to $20.84, so I tell him I wouldn't be able to put anything on the giftcard &amp; ask if he had the remaining 84 cents. ""Wait.. wait hold on..."" he stammered. His fingers trip over the Velcro on this wallet &amp; he anxiously pushes his glasses up his nose as he searches each empty pocket. ""Okay wait... let me see.."" he keeps stuttering as if somehow a dollar would appear in the wallet that only held a school ID &amp; the $20 he came in with. A woman behind him sighs &amp; starts tapping her foot impatiently. ""Well maybe I can just-"" he starts before an older gentleman in the back of the line yells to me ""Hey, how much does the kid need?"" I tell him the balance &amp; he walks up to the register &amp; hands me a dollar bill. The boy's eyes widen in shock as the man tells him to just keep the change &amp; returns to his place in line. I hand him his receipt &amp; the sixteen cents which he then hands back to the man, repeating ""thank you, sir! Thank you, sir!"" ""No I said you can keep-"" but the boy was already tripping over his feet, running out the door, eager to get his gifts home to his mom. True love can't be found from a cheesy online quiz, from matching up horoscopes, or from plucking the petals from a flower. It's not a fancy dinner, a dozen roses, or a box of chocolates.

Its checking to make sure someone got home safe, kicking covers over your partners feet to make sure they stay warm at night, or squeezing for an extra second longer at goodbyes. It can be shared between a boyfriend &amp; girlfriend, a mother &amp; son, or even two strangers who will never know each other's names. Whether you spent the day with a partner or cuddled up with a bowl of brownie batter, I hope you took a moment to be thankful for the love in your life. &amp; I hope that whenever it seems like your plans fall apart &amp; your life is moving down the wrong path, just know true love will always be waiting right around the corner to wrap you in its arms, or even just to hand you 84¢.

Okay, so I called our girl that makes the floral arrangements over the mic ""Hey Shannon, a guest wants to order a floral arrangement. One of the... Buckets?"" and Shannon says ""What buckets?"" I confirm with the lady, ""You wanted a custom floral arrangement, right?""

""Well, I need help figuring out which colour ribbon would look best on my Christmas tree. I need someone who knows about colour. I need someone who knows about floral and colour""

I point to the one with less glitter ""That one will work better because it will make the room look less busy and it won't overpower the purple.""

She finally takes that as an answer after sighing and looking at me like I'm an idiot. Later she tells my manager I refused to call our colour specialist and floral expert. Manager isn't mad, just says that everyone on the floor is doing their job.

Now, the thought process of this lady. Did she need 3 people to help her pick out a shade of ribbon? Did she want me to yell at my manager? ""LISA SEND THE ART MAJOR, GET THE FLORAL EXPERT, WE HAVE A CHRISTMAS RIBBON EMERGENCY.""

Suddenly, we here a yell from my coworker and me and my manager turn around to see a geyser of smoke shooting out from the Lithium battery in the device that was being worked on.  I instantly walked away and my manager and coworker for some reason stuck around for a second, then followed suit when they noticed it was not just smoke, it was actually on fire.  For some reason the fire alarm didn't go off, so we were going to have to do it manually.  But at that second, a customer walked up to the bench.

Me: ""Uh, can I help you?""

Customer: ""Yeah I just wanted to find out what was going on with the computer I left here last week""

Battery: *continues to explode less than five feet away from the customer, who takes no notice of the stream of sulfur-smelling smoke pouring out*

We had to take it in one morning when a tech wasn't on cause of illness and no one responding to being called in, so someone in another department had to take it in and didn't think to ask for the password.

Me: ""we called at least twice""

Customer: ""well that's it but I haven't gotten any calls""

Me: ""we called you, twice.""

I was chatting with my coworker behind the counter and we were minding our own business. All of the sudden, I see a lady throw down two bracelets on my coworker's counter and she runs off almost as quickly as she came in. My coworker and I are a bit startled, as though we actually saw a ghost messing around with the merchandise.

So I pick both the bracelets up and take them back. As I'm putting them away, the Bracelet Lady approaches me and screams, ""What are you doing?! I told you to hold those for me!""

I was confused, because if she said anything, she didn't even make eye contact with either of us or try to get our attention before doing that. I explained that the store's policy states we cannot hold items for customers, but she was welcome to take a basket.

She stared at me wide-eyed for a moment, but then said, ""Well, you should have *told me* I couldn't hold any items when I put them on the counter! You are so, so rude!""

I blinked. I said okay and I gave the bracelets back to her.

I went behind the register again and shrugged at my coworker. It's too rainy to put much thought into it. However, maybe ten seconds after I returned, the Bracelet Lady comes up to us again, and this time even goes back behind the counter with us. She jabs a finger at us and says, ""You know...you two should have *told me* that I couldn't hold items, okay? You two said nothing even as I walked away."" She was trembling and her voice was kind of cracking (keep in mind these are cheapass rope bracelets and there was like fifty of them).

I stared at her as though she was melting into the floor. My coworker, now realizing that I wasn't going to say anything to her, smiled a Retail Smile and said she was sorry about our 'behavior'.

Bracelet Lady didn't like this response from either of us, so she went back to the store and ran over to the designer jewelry counter, where two of my other coworkers are chatting, also minding their own business. They told me later that Bracelet Lady asked if either of them were managers. Neither of them are, but the customer service woman lied and said that she was in fact the manger and asked what the problem was. Bracelet Lady tells them the whole story, and how rude my coworker and I were to her, and how we need to be disciplined.

However, the coworker behind the jewelry counter just blinked, and asked, ""...so do you want to check out *now*, or...?""

That's when Bracelet Lady snarled and screamed, ""No, I'm not spending my *goddamn money* here!"" She threw down the two bracelets and then walked out of the store, not purchasing anything at all.

She should have *told us* she wasn't going to buy anything.",TalesFromRetail,1809,1518396093
charlottezxz,They're all nothing but thieves!,"Hiya my retail brethren, long time lurker and now first time poster.
Today i am going to add a story to the many of the first time and so far only time, I've ever had a really rude and unforgettable customer, for a **TL:DR** please see the bottom, as this is going to be long and detailed, anyway, onwards!


Fresh out of education and looking for a job to get me into the working world, i ended up at a very well known retailer which dabbles in just about everything. Some ways into my work here, i came to know of an event that happens every couple of months or so where almost everything in the story - within reason - is discounted by 20% by customers who are a part of the retailers ‘club’. Although to be honest, we pretty much applied this 20% to customers who weren’t and didn’t want to become a member. Being part of this club costed nothing but some time to sign up and get a card and it was easy to just apply it via a barcode we had and save everyone a bit of time.

I had fared through one of these weekends where it was applied - and i can tell you - it was absolutely mad and stiffelling just how jam packed it just about got. Considering my branch was in one of the biggest shopping outlets in the country, this store was pretty huge - and so where the numbers of people, so it was no surprise on my second weekend, a couple of months later, the expected mass of bodies arrived once more. But by this time i was seasoned and had my mighty till hands, it wasn’t gonna phase me at all.


Our counters on this day had extended in number, normally three tills had now turned into five, with an extra staff member helping to pack per till - because seriously, the queues for every till in our store (we had one row for every department dotted around, so a lot!) snaked around the barriers we had to implement and beyond, out of sight into the horizon of the long shop floor. So as you can imagine, it’s pretty dang loud, noisy, hot and fast paced, with all hands on deck to stack, pack and attack down the numbers as fast as humanly possible. 
So i was doing my best on this fine retailing day to keep pace and serve everyone as nice and pleasantly as possible, whilst also doubling down quick. 


As my current customer leaves i spot her - the typical i-want-to-see-your-manager haircut, some kind snooty stuck up clothing, and the look of someone who is above everyone around her and clearly deserves to have not waited amongst these common folk.
And i have the unfortunate pleasure of serving her at my till.
So here she comes, strutting up to my till and my first thought is she has no trolley and not a lot of items, save for a pair of blue heeled womanly boots in her hands. Should be nothing more than a simple transaction or so i first thought.

SS: is Snooty Snake, rest is pretty self explanatory.

&gt;Me: Hiya, did you find everything ok?

&gt;SS:Actually,  i found these blue boots out on your shop floor and i was wondering if you had anymore.

&gt;Me:What's wrong, are they not the right size for you?

&gt;SS:Oh they are, it’s just they have this terrible scuff on them that makes them unwearable to say the least.

It’s at this point i look closer to them, and on the toe part of the shoe, these is indeed a scuff - something incredibly small and to be honest, if the shoe was buffed up a bit, is more or less not very noticeable. Now i wasn’t a part of the women's wear department, but thankfully due to the amount of hands needed, some time prior i had asked a colleague regarding another shoes stock so knew the status of them at the time.

&gt;Me:I’m really sorry to say, but all the stock that’s out is all that we have. As you know we have a big sale on today, so everything is going a bit fast.

&gt;SS:Oh...well….can you discount them for me?

&gt;Me:I can discount them by 20%, with our sale today.

&gt;SS:Is that it? They’re damaged and the only pair left in the store. If i won’t buy them, no one else will.

&gt;Me:Ma’m i am ____ department, i can’t discount the price of a product from another department, that wouldn’t be my call.

&gt;SS:Can you get someone to do that then?

&gt;Me:I can ask for someone, yes.

So one of my colleagues calls through to get someone from the woman’s department for shoes to come over and talk. They pretty much confirm my thoughts, we can’t discount them any further, it’s either the 20% from the sale or 10% that’s normal for damages. So at 20% which she wouldn’t have got on a normal day, this is already a better deal even if they are a bit damaged, So now the lady is pondering there for a bit, and the line is building up some more…

&gt;SS:Would you be able to get me one of those brushes?

&gt;ME:Brushes?

&gt;SS: Those special brushes you need to buff the shoes of course.

&gt;ME:Sure thing, i can run across to the store room to see if they have one.

So i go and get one for the lady, come back and hand it to her.
She has a go at buffing the shoes herself, eating up more time that could have been for another customer to serve - but i’m polite and just wait for her to decide.

&gt;SS:No...this still won’t do, i can’t take these…

&gt;Me:Ma’m there might be something else i can do to help you. I can check our stock online and see if we can order a pair of those shoes either here for store collection or delivery to your home.

So the lady agrees and i fetch our stores in house ipad that we use to order online products we don’t have in store. Sure enough, it says  that the product is in stock, so i get the customer to sign in with their club member account, add it to the basket and head to check out. Taking her details, she tells us she would like for it to be delivery - so now we come to payment. However the moment we do - it suddenly states that the shoes are out of stock. Ouch. Where we too late?

&gt;Me:Oh...i’m really sorry Ma'am but the shoes have just gone out of stock.

&gt;SS:What!? They can’t have they were just in stock!

&gt;Me:I’m really sorry, it did say they were. The site must be running slow due to processing a lot of orders because of the sale, so it might have been out of stock for a while and not updated.

Whilst i’m talking with my customer, a colleague two tills down asks for the ipad for a client who wants to order something online too. So i hand it to her to use whilst i continue to chat to my customer. She’s still so very insistent on these boots, and now as we are talking, starts moaning about how long she has been waiting in queue, that she has a really bad hip and can’t stand here much longer. She’s being stubborn but still i do want to help this customer get these shoes, i always like to arrive at some sort of a solution for my customers if i can.

It’s at this point that i hear the client’s phone buzz, even above the noise, she’s gotten a message of some sort. Apparently that’s more important than our conversation - but i let it slide. Who knows, she might be awaiting an important message. Boy was i wrong.

&gt;SS:Why have you bought me a cashmere jumper!?

&gt;Me:Excuse me?

&gt;SS:You’ve taken money from me! You’ve just charged me £50 for a jumper!!!

She thrusts the phone across from me at my face. There on the screen are her emails,  and on the one open, sure enough it thanks her for ordering a £50 cashmere jumper, stating where she is to pick it up from in store. It takes me a moment to ponder before i click what has happened...i look across to my fellow cashier two tills down who has now also realised the same thing. 

&gt;Me: _____, i think you’ve ordered this jumper in my customers name…

&gt;Colleague:I know, i know, i forgot to sign your one out..

I turn back to my customer who has now reddened in the face, angry beyond belief that she thinks she has been charged £50 for an item she hasn’t even ordered. But i know better and try to explain to her to calm her down, taking the ipad to indicate too. 

&gt;Me: Ma'am you haven’t actually been charged £50 for that item, what’s happened is that my colleague forgot to sign your club account out. So her customer has ordered this item, which she has also paid for - only it has not come under her name but yours. You haven’t been charged anything, you’ve just received an email of confirmation you shouldn’t have to pick up that item at ____ store. 

But this lady, she was having none of it, and it was at this point i lost all respect for her. Redder than a summer tomato, and clearly not listening, she started yelling and turned herself around to the enormous queue of people. She’s trying to rile them up and get them to chip in with her - none of them do.

&gt;SS:Theses people are robbing **insert foul word**! They do nothing but take money from you, they’ve charged me £50 for a jumper i didn’t even order!

&gt;SS:You can't trust any of them, they’re all after your money! They’re all nothing but thieves!

I am standing there, bewildered, all of my colleagues are wild eyed too. I notice this woman’s husband scurry off as well, leaving me wonder if he has seen this crap before too. She’s so loud, slandering all of us staff on the tills and the store - that there was no need to call for a manager...her obscenities were a summon in itself.

Three managers spawn, and I explain to my department manager what’s happened. How she thinks she has been charged £50, only it’s just in her name, and that it needs to be resolved. If anyone has suffered, it’s my colleagues customer, who wouldn’t even be able to pick up her cashmere jumper as it wasn’t in her name. So she gets to reversing it and i’m left to try and cool the fire that is her.

Somehow...somehow i manage to get through to her...and she listens….she starts to get it. A whirlwind of trying to explain and get past her verbal onslaught. She is still simmering...but no longer angsty with the crowd...which is getting bigger with two out of our five tills now occupied with this situation. She’s starting to get it...in her own way.

&gt;SS:I hope you’re not keeping her. 

&gt;Me:Excuse me?

&gt;SS:It’s all her fault isn’t it, all this mess. You can’t keep someone like THAT in your store, conning people out of money and making those kinds of mistakes - it simply won’t do.
You’ll just have to get rid of her after Christmas.

Oh god...you don’t understand how inside now...i’m furious with this lady.
She is making a fuss over nothing, a simple mistake. She has not been listening and worse tried to make a big scene...and now has the nerve to slander my colleague...who had just come back today after weeks of being off sick with a serious infection - and still is sick and honestly is  a very sweet and nice person...it’s an off day for her sure...but how dare this woman..! As much as i’d love to give her a good slap and straighten her out - i know better...and keep it to myself, simply nodding in a half hearted agreement...knowing letting her hear what she wanted to hear would keep her somewhat cool as much as i disagreed with her.

Eventually...the ipad situation is resolved...all the while my customer continues to slander and make remarks about my colleague...whilst her customer is wonderful, despite being the real victim of the mistake here, has remained calm, patient and understanding. But i know that we’re far from done with this woman, she has yet to obtain her precious shoes.
So i explain the situation with the shoes, how they were out of stock in store and online and that perhaps our last option would be to call neighbouring stores to see if they might have them...so my manager gets onto the phone, whilst the others help try and speed up the other tills.

This woman now looks snootier than ever, nose up, as if we now have to treat and tend to her every desire after this atrocious situation has had  happened to her! Oh gods! Still remarking and making unnecessary comments my blood is still boiling. I feign understanding with her, oh her poor legs...oh her poor hip...oh her poor husband...oh her poor this. Oh please. Never mind the fact everyone is bending over backwards to help you and you’ve been standing here slandering everyone for over AN HOUR!

Many phone calls around, and it turns out a store does have these very elusive azure boots! But our Snooty lady hasn’t had the last word yet.

&gt;SS:Get them delivered to me.

&gt;Manager:Of course we can do home delivery for you at a -

&gt;SS:It will be free, won’t it?

&gt;Manager:O-f...course...it will be!

My manager finishes up ordering these shoes for the lady, waiving the delivery charge and even assuring that these boots will be expressly delivered to her door the very next day. I’m so glad...so thankful...she’s going to be going now...

&gt;SS:That’s not all now is it?

We look at her like she’s delivering the sequel product no one wants.

&gt;SS:After all this, after waiting x time, being treated like this, i have a right to a bit more.

&gt;SS:You know what i should have…

She takes the biggest pause to do her snakey little look to the left thinking in some snakey deep thought before she looks back.

&gt;SS:A free drink in your cafe…oh and a free lunch as well, i deserve that after all this, don’t you think..?

She looks over to her left, snapping her fingers and calling over her husband who has appeared quite timely.

&gt;SS:Oh and for my husband as well.

I just...i couldn’t believe it, so i look to my manager who agrees with this woman, and starts to personally escort her to the cafe for the free meals and drinks. I’m fuming and appalled at this lady’s behavior as she swans off self righteously. My next customer comes up, commenting on what a bitch she was and that she heard everything and i just nodded, as i ring up her items. 

**TL;DR; Snooty woman thinks she's charged £50 for a jumper she didn't order and slanders everyone in the store. Gets away with being a bitch for blue boots and free cafe food and drink to boot.**

empressfelicia,"I would love to see how the price is supposedly ""wrong""","Hello again, TFR. Sorry for any formatting or grammar issues.

So at the craft store we work at, we honor prices that are displayed incorrectly.

So I call up the next customers to my register. Here comes Customer (C) and Customer's Friend (CF) (Side note: there was a 60% off coupon for one regular priced item. This becomes relevant later)

I greet just like any other customer, and I ring up their item, which is priced at $20, and then I scan their coupon, which brings the price to about $8 before tax.

&gt; Me: Your total is $8

&gt; C: No that can't be right.

&gt; Me: I'm sorry? How is it not right?

&gt; C: It said it was $10

(Another side note, C's tone was really aggressive.)

&gt; CF: Yeah, it said it was $10! Are you stupid?

Then they proceed to talk amongst themselves.

&gt; Me: I would love to see where the item was displayed.

CF walks me to where they found the item, and I'm scanning the item in-hand, to confirm exact item location.

Anyways, we arrive to the section, where the items were [placed] (https://imgur.com/a/0qNyK) on top of two different prices. On the left was the $20 price. On the right was the $10. 

&gt; CF: See! It's supposed to be $10! (In I-told-you-so attitude)

I then move the item stack to the left by one inch.

&gt; Me: What price is it?

CF realizes that the price rung up at the registers was correct. We walk back to the registers, where CF informs C, and they abruptly leave.

tl;dr - Customer says price is wrong, I check out how it was displayed, and see that the item was on two different prices. I move the item by one inch to where it's supposed to be. The price wasn't wrong.",TalesFromRetail,1176,1518283315
Killer-Barbie,Ahem,"Today we got slammed right as someone left for break. So I manned till while my only other coworker in the store ran everything else. Then I get a lady with a super straight forward exchange, but it takes a little bit more time. Behind her is The Man. The Man is very impatient. I can see it as he's twitching, and shuffling, and sighing... And as he's clearing his throat (almost as if to remind me he was still waiting) and complaining about the wait.

Behind him is my favorite regular. She's in her 80's and hikes mountains with 3 generations of offspring. She's Scottish, with a beautiful speaking voice. She also calls everyone Lad or Lass. As he attempts to speed along the customer ahead of him with another cough, she leans forward with a tin extended in her hand.

angelofthemorning4,The time a customers husband told her to shut up.,"I have posted here once before and as more stories come back to me, I might post more if there's an interest. I worked at a local grocery store for eight years. Also, on mobile, so excuse any formatting errors. 

One day, I was working at the checkstands when I saw a couple coming towards me. A fellow employee was coming back from break and happened to squeeze between the wife and a display case, as he was late to get back. I hear this lady sigh and loudly exclaim, ""Excuse you!""

Now I can understand where she was coming from as the least the guy could do was say excuse me, but there was enough room for him to get by without nudging her or anything. 

Anyway, this couple comes through my lane, and as I'm ringing them out, the lady just keeps going on and on about how rude the kid was. I'm not kidding when I say she keeps saying, ""he didn't even say 'excuse me'"", repeatedly. The entire time I'm checking them out.

Apparently the husband had had enough because he just turns to her and loudly says, ""would you just shut up already?!"" I had to try really hard not to laugh as he said this and it earned him a death glare, but she finally stopped talking about how rude that boy was. 

Definitely one of the more entertaining conversations I've witnessed at that place. ",TalesFromRetail,2445,1518208062
AusDerAsche,But the groupon says you close at 9!,"Work at a winery. We have an offer on Groupon for a BOGO wine flight, Groupon customers in general seem to be the absolute worst with reading comprehension but that's a whole different bag of worms. 

Its a bit after closing time, which is 6pm, I've already closed the register for the day but we were booked for a wedding in our back room from 6-1030, so I am obviously unable lock the doors to allow guests to come in. I'm cleaning the bar off before I go home since a different girl is scheduled to work the wedding, when this stupid lady (SL) comes in with a Groupon.

Me:Hi, are you with the wedding party? (I knew she wasn't, as she wasn't dressed up) 

SL: No, I have a Groupon.

Me: I'm sorry we closed at 6, you'll have to come back tomorrow, we open at noon. 

SL: I drove 4 hours to get here! And this paper (the groupon) says you close at 9!

I ask her to show me the paper, I wouldn't have been that suprised if there was a typo. I look it over and am impressed with her stupidity

Me: ...These are the hours for the Groupon help line.

I lay the paper on the bar and point where it says this boldly above the hours

SL: Well if your not open why are all these other people here? (referring to the wedding in the back room) 

Me: That's a private wedding, and they paid hundred of dollars to be here.

SL: but I drove 4 hours to do this! 

I take pity on her and agree to do the tasting, I tell her  it has to be fast,  she's not even supposed to be here because of the private event (it's in our event contracts that if you book after business hours that you will not have to worry about any outside customers)

I pour her each wine and I tell her nothing about them except which wine I'm pouring her, she bitches about how fast it all went and then wants to purchase bottles.

ME: I'm sorry, the register is closed, I can't process any transactions... 

SL: I CAN'T BELIEVE I DROVE FOUR HOURS FOR THIS!

always_asdfghjkl,"""SURELY you're KIDDING"".","**TL;DR: Customer's a bitch and karma is a lie.**

So this happened a few months ago, when I worked as a cashier in a large grocery store in a big city. We got all types there, but being a teenager at the time I never got put on the night shifts, so I apparently missed most of the crazy.

I guess the night shift people just forgot that daytime crazy exists.

A lady approaches my cash in the afternoon one day, when it was incredibly busy and I was working the express lane. I was fairly new a and was still working out the order in what to say things was, so I was slow. She was shifty, looking around like she was paranoid, but didn't really do anything too weird, so I brushed that off and finished ringing her up.

Rewards card? Yes, she's got that, no problems. She'll be paying with debit, all right then. Oh, and she has a colleague discount card. 

The policy at my store at the time was that if the cashier didn't recognize the person, (meaning they most likely worked at another branch of the store,) we had to ask them for ID, which was pretty standard. This was because we'd often have people giving their friends their discount, or their kids, and the colleague had to be present at time of the discount. I got a lot of flack for that, when that policy was set, but anyway.

I didn't know her, and she wasn't in the uniform, so I asked for ID. She flipped.

""DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IN THE YEARS I'VE COME HERE, I HAVE NEVER BEEN ASKED FOR ID???? WHAT, YOU DON'T TRUST ME? I LIKE TO THINK I'M A TRUSTWORTHY PERSON! SURELY YOU'RE KIDDING!""

At that point I was scared, and tried to say something about the policy.

""WELL OBVIOUSLY I KNOW THE POLICY, I AM AN EMPLOYEE! GET ME YOUR MANAGER, HE'LL TALK SOME SENSE INTO YOU!""

I called the manager. She immediately rung the discount through and left, leaving me dumbstruck. I was salty about that until I quit. 

I was told later by a coworker that the lady had been an employee, but that she hadn't worked for the company in years. The managers knew her and would still let her through. She wasn't even old - couldn't have been older than thirty. I pray for her former colleagues.",TalesFromRetail,925,1518110624

Since we sold a lot of body jewelry and I really, really liked my job, I often took it upon myself to read up and educate myself on piercings and such during my offtime.  As a result I was the resident ""piercing expert"" (which was interesting b/c I have the least amount of piercings than anyone else, lol) - but I did know my stuff.

So when a lady came in with her son asking about earrings, my employees asked me to help her.  (And, as a manager, I was one of the few with keys to the body jewelry cases.)  I introduce myself, and ask how I can help out.  She will be L for Lady, S for son, P for Pebcak (me.)

&gt;L:  My son actually has prosthetic ears, and he wants to get them pierced so they look more realistic.  I don't mind doing that, but I don't want to put a big hole in them.

&gt;P:  Okay, well the smallest size we have are 20 gauge, which will be a little tiny hole.  *Pulls out random pair to show the size.*

&gt;L:  That's not bad, okay, here Son, pick out some you like so we can compare.

&gt;S:  *Picks 2 or 3 pairs really excitedly.*

&gt;L:  Now don't freak out.  *PULLS THE SON'S EAR OFF and proceeds to put the earrings up against it to see how they look, which 'fit' the 'lobe' the best, etc.*

I told her that I couldn’t just let her skip the queue, it’s up to her to ask the people in front and then it’s their choice. She didn’t take a liking to that and proceeded to her rude with me and said “you don’t want to piss me off today”. So I just stopped replying when she was making off handed comments.

DeadMiner,The Leslie Chronicles: Tommy and the Bolt Cutters,"*About 4 months ago, a strange man called Leslie became a regular at the local hardware store. This is one of many stories involving him.*

Leslie doesn’t really have a pattern. He could come in at any given moment, and we’ll never be ready for him or his antics. This time, he came in before my shift, more excited than usual.

&gt;**Les:** “Tom! Where’s Tom?”

&gt;**Cashier:** “Who?”

&gt;**Les:** “Tom, the one that works here. I need to speak to him right away.”

&gt;**Cashier:** “I don’t believe a Tom has ever worked here...”

&gt;**Les:** “Well there should be a Tom. You should hire a Tom.”

&gt;**Cashier:** “I’ll get right on that. Is there something I can help you with?”

&gt;**Les:** “I need a pair of bolt cutters, the best pair you have. Doesn’t need to be perfect, as long as it’s cheap.”

So the cashier tells him where to find the bolt cutters, and he purchases them.

&gt;**Les:** “Wait till my neighbors see what I do with these! They’re not going to be happy about it.”

&gt;**Cashier:** “Just don’t do anything Illegal with them.”

Leslie laughs as he walks out the door.

I start my shift a little later, and the cashier tells me the story. I got a good chuckle out of it, but didn’t think anything more of it until a couple came later that evening.

They’re looking for a padlock, and it *needs* to be bolt cutter proof.

As I finish ringing her order, she hands me a check and the following exchange ensues:

&gt;Me: May I please see your membership again?

-
&gt;CL: Well what do you need that for?

-
&gt;Me: I just need to verify the name on the check.

-
&gt;CL: Oh... are you new?

-
&gt;Me: No, I’m not, I’m just following store policy, ma’am.

-
&gt;CL: Well, how long have you been here??

-
&gt;Me: About six months.

-
&gt;CL: Oh, yeah, you’re new. I have been coming here for years and all your managers know me.


At this point I have no idea how to respond. I should mention that during this exchange she was, in fact, looking for her card in her purse and gave it to me while talking about how long she had been a customer. Look, I don’t care how long you’ve been shopping here, I’m not getting in trouble because “your manager knows me.” I ask everyone for their card, even if I know them, in case a manager happens to be walking by.

God I love people.",TalesFromRetail,1524,1517829400
Pofoml,"""Then I will be back with my gun.""","Today we had an issue where we had to call the police for a verbal threat.

Guy came in with a product that he didn't understand how to use.   The employee spent a good part of the morning talking to the man over the phone on how to use this product, but he just was not understanding it.  She did an excellent job explaining it to the man, but he was frustrated. 

He came into the store and the interaction went like this.

C is customer, E is employee, Me is me.

&gt;C: I want to return this piece of trash!

&gt;E:Not a problem, I need the device here to return it.

&gt;C:Now I gotta drive home and get that GODDAM piece of garbage and bring it back!?

&gt;Me:Sir, do not tell in the store, we have other families here, we are trying to conduct Buisness.  Lower your voice and do not swear at my employee.

At this point the customer swears again and throws his keys as hard as he can against the wall.


&gt;Me: Leave immediately or I am going to call the cops.  You are yelling and throwing things. Everyone in the store feels threatened by you right now.

&gt;C:CALL THE COPS!!

&gt;Me: okay E, call the police.  Sir, you are no longer welcome at our store.  You need to leave immediately. 
 Customer turns to exit and as he walks out the door we all heard him say this

&gt;C: I'll be back with my gun! 

So we call the police and they are waiting for the guy in his driveway.  They confirm that he had a gun at his house that was registered and they went to go talk to him.  We have a no trespass on him so if we see him around we are calling the cops on him.

Usually I am very patient.  I give customers probly way more wiggle room than I should, but today was just different.  I did not give this guy one inch of leighway. Although I didn't do anything to escalate the situation, I certainly didn't do anything to de-escalate either.  I still feel I made the right call given what he said as he was walking out.  Who walks out of a store filled with families, small children, and elderly people making threats about coming back with a gun over a product that you didn't understand how to use?",TalesFromRetail,738,1517800808
ChaoticKittyy,The soda guy,"Howdy Reddit! So I will preface this story with I work in an electronics store, but near the checkout we sell some small snacks and drinks. Also, this story happened to a couple of my coworkers some years ago and not myself, but I felt it definitely belongs here.

So there are two people that have worked the checkout of this store for a very long time; I'll call them Claire and Mary. There are two parts to the front lanes of the store - general checkout and in store pickup. This day in particular, Claire was assigned general checkout and Mary was assigned store pickup. 

An older man (probably late 70s or 80s) walks up to the store pickup and Mary proceeds to process his order. As Mary goes behind the pickup counter to retrieve his items, he begins to glance about the store. That's when he notices the two coolers filled with drinks. It was a slower day, so Claire really had nothing better to do than observe this guy. According to Claire, his eyes lit up like a Christmas tree and bolts over to the cooler with the sodas, much faster than you would expect a man his age to move.

He presses his hands against the glass and gleefully shouts, ""I didn't know you sold soda here!! This is cool!!!!"" He grabbed exactly 6 soda bottles and 1 water bottle and practically threw them at Claire. At this point, Mary is rounding the corner back to her register, and all she sees is the gentleman bouncing on his toes, eagerly awaiting Claire to scan all his beverages. It was like watching a child open their birthday presents. 

They rung him out for his drinks and finalized his order and left the store happy as a bug in a rug. 

So, for the next two years after this, he came in once a month and bought 6 sodas and 1 water, and always made sure to do it with either Claire or Mary (apparently making a point to not purchase them from anyone else when neither of them were on shift). But never bought any electronics, ALWAYS the 6 sodas, and 1 water.

They really got to know him very well. His name was Liam and he had been married to the same woman for almost 50 years. When asked about how *she* felt about his beverage runs, he said he was pretty sure it made her happy to see him leave the house, followed by a good laugh.

But, there was a span of about 3 months where Liam didn't come to the store. Eventually, his wife showed up specifically asking to speak to either Mary or Claire. Mary was there and the woman explained she was Liam's wife, and he had recently passed, peacefully in his sleep though. He was also on the autistic spectrum, and was in a bit of a lull before his first trip to our store, and when he had come home that afternoon with the sodas raving about how wonderful he thought that was, his entire mood had shifted and he became the man she married again. So, the wife thanked Mary  (and Claire in spirit) for making his final years so bright. 

Not the typical story on this subreddit, I know. But I thought it was really beautiful and would be a nice change of pace. RIP, Liam, you will always be remembered.",TalesFromRetail,2694,1517703063
obvretailthrowaway,"Sir, I can't return your phone that's full of water.","So I worked in an electronics department in a retail store way back. We sold prepaid cell phones. Our policy is that if the phone is damaged by the customer or missing parts, we can't give a refund.

I start checking it out, looking at the condition, etc. I open up the back to see if the SIM card and battery are still inside. When I do a ton of water splashes out all over the desk.

Me: ""Sir.. I can't give you a refund for this phone."" I explain our refund policy in the nicest way possible.

He proceeds to protest, saying that he spent a lot of money on it and the store should reimburse him, etc. Finally after I refuse again, he takes the phone from my hand and wipes it off on his shirt.

Him: ""There's no water damage. See, it's dry.""

Me: "".. I just saw it full of water, sir.""

Him: ""But look, it turns on, it works fine. There's no water damage."" 

He spends the next five minutes trying to convince me that the phone is fine and dry. I refuse again and he storms off towards the front of the store. Thinking that he's gonna try to get a return there, I call up to the front managers and tell them what happened. He turned around as if he was going to say something else, saw me on the phone, and walked off flustered and mumbling. 

tl:dr; Customer tries to return a phone full of water, dries it off after I've told him I can't take it due to the water. Tries to pass it off as dry and functioning. Gets annoyed when I refuse again.",TalesFromRetail,1848,1517668818

To start: at my store we have to ask for ID if you use credit no matter what, also I am Black (this is relevant.)

So I’m at my register when a (Black) guy comes up, ready to check out. I do the obligatory Hi How are you, did you find everything okay? We have a civil conversation, and I finish scanning his items pretty quickly. I tell him the price and he gets out his card...

Me: Credit or debit?

Him: Credit 

Me: Okay can I see your ID please?

Him: *sighs* oh it’s gonna be one of THOSE days 

Me: Are you okay?

Him: I just- being a black man and you asking for my ID.. I’ll just pay cash 

Me: (internally i’m like wtf I am black, like obviously black, like ?!?!) Um?? I have to ask everyone for their ID if they pay credit.

Him: I rather just not deal with it *hands me cash*

Killer-Barbie,The Couple,"So I've been at my current management location for a year an a half. These stories are spread out over that time.

So my first week I trained with the guy I was taking over from, Manager A. On his last day we went for beers. As we're sitting around a random guy comes up to us.

RG: hey Manager M! You remember me? I'm in all the time. Here let me buy you drink!

MM: hi, I'm sorry I'm not at work right now and I would like to just spend time with my friends

RG: Fine, fine. I can take a hint *throws $6 on the table and walks away*

About 3 days later he comes into the store in a power walk and points at me

RG: You, I want you to help me.

So I go to help, and spend nearly an hour explaining why just because he left us money for drink (?) I can't give him a discount.

RG: MM always gave me a discount.

Me: Well, MM isn't the manager here anymore I am. MM moved to a different store.

Flash forward to black Friday 2016. He comes in 3 days before and picks out about $1000 worth of stuff. 

RG:I want all this at black Friday prices. 

Me: Actually our black Friday sale is already up, none of these items are on sale this week. 

RG: well I only have $300 to spend so I need all this for under 300. 

Me: (please note, at this point I asked a bunch of questions to see if this gear was even right for him) well that pack is buy a brand that doesn't usually go on sale but this pack is comparable and half the price. And if you switch to this tent it's only $200. it's a little heavier but as a car camper that's less of a problem. 

RG:why can't you just give me this stuff? *as he walks away frustrated.*

We saw him on black Friday. He bought a $20 shirt. 

A number of weeks later a lady comes into our store with the aforementioned t shirt and the winter jacket RG was wearing.

Angry Lady: I need to return these. My. Boyfriend stole all my things and I need to get back at him.

Me: I can't return these, they've been worn and you have no tags or receipts.

AL: I HAVE CANCER!

Me: I'm sorry, that must be very trying. Back to the matter at hand...

AL: WHY WON'T YOU HELP A LADY WITH BACK CANCER? Do you know what life is like living in pain all the time? You're discriminatory against the disabled

At this point my cashier (who wears 2 forearm crutches) turns to her and says, ""as one disabled woman to another I can't believe you're trying that card to get a refund. It's fucking disgusting."" and walked away from the cash desk.

AL: (much meeker) There's really nothing you can do?

She was much quieter on leaving.

Now, yesterday. Almost a year later.

""Killer-Barbie can you come to footwear for customer service?"" this is our code for ""someone wants a discount"" and I'm prepared. Our company switched (on Monday) to bonuses on margin. Which means they've updated our discount policies including adding a volume discount guideline.

RG: I'm buying shoes and a back pack I want a discount.

Me:I would be happy to give you a discount. Our volume discount policy is right here. You must spend at least $2000 and there must be at least 10 of the same item on the bill. The volume discount comes off the original price, so please ignore the markdown prices on items as we'll have to mark them back up to give the discount.

RG: 2000?what you think I'm rich?

Me: I wouldn't pretend to know your financial situation. Once you've made your selections let my associates know and they'll call me to approve that discount.

So he sits in my footwear section and calls customer service to complain. Customer service calls me.

CS: HI I have a gentleman by the name of AR on the phone and he says he was denied a sale price because of his race?

Me: Was he? He asked me about a volume discount and I gave him the guidelines. Let me check with him and see if I can smooth over the situation. *walk up to him, he's still on the phone* AR I just got a phone call that you were denied a discount do to your race? Who did that?

AR: uh... I didn't say that

Me: wonderful, I'll let customer service know it was a misunderstanding

sidy24,Stupid watch customer,"So I worked in a jewellery store for years, one of our services was to change watch batteries.

One day this bloke comes in, with an expensive watch, to have the battery replaced. I get it done, and send him on his way.

A week later, he storms through the doors, screaming that I have broken his watch, I will replace it with the newer model, that he was late for his appointment in the major city across the border, because I had broken his watch. This whole time, his wife is standing behind him, nodding, and saying ""yeah!"" over and over again.

He slams the watch on the counter, and I take a look at it.

The idiot had changed the time on his watch when crossing the border, but hadn't pushed the crown back in, meaning the watch never started ticking again when he changed it.

Putting on my best ""How can I help you smile"", I ask if he changed the time on it recently. He goes on a ramble about ""Of course I changed it, what kind of idiot do you think I am"" while his wife smirks.

I walk around the counter to him, hold the watch up, and push in the crown. The watch starts ticking.

I hand him the watch, his jaw has hit the floor, and his wife is already half way out the store by the time I ask ""Is there anything else I can help you with today?""

fresh-n-spicy,"Woman offended when I said ""sorry about the wait"" to person behind her","Hello! Long time lurker, first time poster. I've had my fair share of ""tales from retail""-worthy stories, but I think this one takes the cake. When I was 17, I worked at a small pet store where there were usually only one or two people working at a time. The store was franchised and was recently sold back to corporate (which is when I started working there). The franchisees did nothing properly, which caused a lot of problems for us.


One of the things we offered were frequent buyer programs for different pet foods. For these programs, we had to keep the barcodes or receipts from each bag/case of cans purchased and we had to have the customers' name and address since their ""free bag"" coupon was sent to them in the mail.


For this story, I'll be M and the crazy woman will be CW.


CW comes up with big case of cans of dog food.

CW: ""I'd like to add this to my frequent buyer card.""

M: After looking through cards, ""Sorry, I don't seem to have one for you. You may have redeemed your last one. I'll start you a new one and just need you to fill out your name and address.""

CW: ""Why do you need that information? They never needed it last time.""

M: ""The company won't be able to send you your coupon without this information.""


She huffs and fills it out. Because she's buying a case of cans, I have to take a copy of her receipt. After she finishes paying for her purchase, I try to photocopy her receipt.


CW: ""What do you think you're doing?""

M: ""I need proof of purchase for the program.""

CW: ""Well they never needed that before. That's taking my personal information. What if someone steals it and gets my information?""


It goes on like this for awhile, she finally huffs again and lets me photocopy her receipt and I give her original back. I'm the only one working the store and at this point a line has developed behind her. 


She starts loading her one case of cans into one of our small store carts. We have a policy where we don't let the carts leave the store because, since I'm the only one working, I can't be searching the massive parking lot later for the carts when people inevitably leave them lying around. We do offer to help people out with purchases they can't carry easily. Takes less time than searching for missing carts. I tell her this policy.


CW: ""Well they always let me before.""

M: ""I'm sorry but it's store policy. I'd be happy to help you out with your purchase.""

CW: ""What? Do you think I won't take the cart back or something? Besides, you have a line forming"" (Which is partially her fault...)


At this point I'm so tired of dealing with this woman that I just let her go with the cart. As she finishes loading it up, I start helping the man behind her. When he comes up to the till I say ""Sorry about the wait,"" since, as you can guess, he had been waiting for quite some time.


CW: ""EXCUSE ME? How dare you say that! I'M your customer, and when I'M at the till you should be taking care of ME and I'm allowed to take as MUCH time as I want.""


I'm absolutely floored by this. Saying ""sorry about the wait"" is pretty common practice. I just stare at her for a moment and say.


M: ""I'm sorry, but I did take the time to serve you. He was waiting for awhile, so it's common courtesy to say sorry.""


At this point she of course asks for my manager's name and phone number. Saying something about how she's going to get me fired. She storms out with her cart and I keep helping the man. He calls her a bitch and tells me not to worry about it.


She then comes back, throws open the store door and tosses in the cart. She keeps the door open long enough to say, ""See? I TOLD YOU I'd bring it back!"" then storms off and slams the door behind her.


Sure enough, my manager never heard from her.

PmButtPics4ADrawing,Guy makes me use a different register because I cleaned the belt,"I work at a grocery store, so our registers get *filthy*. 

I had a break between customers after a rush today so I started cleaning the nastiness off the register, something we do multiple times a day. I sprayed some of our cleaner on the conveyor belt and started wiping it off with a paper towel. As I had gotten most of it cleaned up (but still with a bit of moisture left over which dries up completely with one more wiping down with the towel) a man comes over with his cart and comments on the smell. 

I told him I was just wiping down the register, and he asks if I can switch to another belt. We're generally supposed to stay at our assigned registers unless we're told to move, so I went and asked our front end leader. She looked confused and asked him what was wrong, and he pretty much repeated what he said to me, saying the ""chemicals will contaminate the food"" and whatever. So she had me move over one register because it just wasn't worth arguing with him about it.

It wasn't too busy, so it wasn't even much of an inconvenience to move. 

It's just like... homie... even if our cleaner *wasn't* non-toxic (spoiler: it is), do you really think any of the other registers haven't also been wiped down a dozen times today? I literally watched the girl who was previously on the register we moved to wipe it down less than 10 minutes prior.

cake4lies,Amex is Never Declined,"A gentleman in a suit walked into the Tech Store during the holiday rush, and asked to purchase an iPod.  I selected the one that he selected, then as I pulled out a handheld Point of Sale device, he pulled out a Black American Express card.

A quick word about Black (Metal) American Express Cards.  Those are very exclusive, and American Express does not just hand those out; they’re usually for business owners or people who are very, very wealthy.  There is no limit on them.  

You could literally walk into a mall with one of these, and say, “I am buying this store.  All of it.  Here is my Amex, ring it up please.”  

And that’s the other part: American Express will honor these transactions, no matter what they are.  The catch is cardholder liability (so I’ve been told, I am not that wealthy, and I do not possess one of these) is slightly different for those luxurious and elite cardholders. 

Back to the story.  The gentleman who asked for an iPod pulled out a Black American Express card, and handed it to me.  I nervously asked for his ID.  Our store had just changed its policy to always ask for a government ID, but you’re not technically supposed to ask if the card was signed, which it was.  He looked annoyed, but gave a slight shrug and handed me a driver’s license, which showed him glowering at the camera.  I handed back the driver’s license, and then swiped the thick metal card through the reader with a bit of difficulty.  It declined.

I was frozen in shock for a moment, and as a result had nothing approaching my usual mask of calm.  The gentleman, already a bit annoyed, asked what the problem was.  I nervously, quietly, told him that the transaction had been declined.  It was now a competition for who was more shocked, him or me.  He angrily demanded that I run it again, but I explained to him that doing so would not be a wise idea; whatever was going on, there was a good chance that multiple swipe attempts could result in a freeze on the card.  After a bit more calming and coaxing, he agreed to step outside and contact American Express, leaving me awkwardly standing in a busy store with an iPod, a Point of Sale device, wearing a harried look, and as patiently as possible telling anyone who approached, fellow employee or customer, that I was **busy** as I watched the customer scream on the phone outside.  

Gradually his screaming subsided, he calmed down, then calmly walked back into the store.  He gave no explanation, but told me to run the card again.  At that point, I was desperate for anything to make this entire debacle be over, so I complied.  Thankfully, the transaction went through—now it was someone else’s problem.  He took the purchase and left without another word.",TalesFromRetail,2015,1516919021
IndyRook,HOW THE HELL...oh nevermind,"I had just opened the door to our grocery store last Saturday and was barely five feet from the entrance when a man came in loud and angry.
Angry Man(am): You the manager?
Me: [crap I am today] Yes sir, how may I help?
AM reached inside a shopping bag and pulls out a plastic container. I recognize it as one of our special buy items that we just put out this week. He holds it up, empty, and I think he's gonna ask where he can find more. Unfortunately, we had sold out already. This is gonna be uncomfortable.
Instead it takes a turn.
AM: how the hell are we supposed to open this same thing?
He shoves the plastic container at me, a little pickle juice still inside, and I take it. I look at the top and it has been cut open like a can of beans with my dad's old military can opener. 
Me: uhm...
AM: Yeah! I had to take a stake knife to open the same thing. what do you do super glue them shut? 
He red in the face and I see a co-worker stop walking towards me and 180 back down another aisle. I look at the container while he rants and draws attention. I see that the lid seal, a little plastic tab had been snapped so it should have opened. I push my thumb up on the lid and a ring of plastic pops right off. This would have been the entire lid of Freddy Krueger here hadn't lost his mind digging for pickles. 
Me: Hmm, well...
AM: the duck you do that?
I show him what I had done and he realizes he had been trying to pull on the container and not the lid the entire time. 
AM: sumbitch
He politely takes the container back puts it in his sack turns and quickly walkout the door.

Awesome way to start a Saturday! Making a customer look like an idiot I'm front of a bunch of people.😈

TL;DR angry customer is too stupid to open pickles and shamefully walk away by being made aware of his low I.Q.",TalesFromRetail,1193,1516888270
Fubeca02,"""Customer care said that you guys should have done this""","Hey, this is my first post here and I'm on mobile so excuse me if anything is off.

I work at a large mobile phone retailer and yesterday a middle- aged country lady came in to tell us about how her phone wasn't working. It was an older smartphone and it was running slowly and charging poorly, as older phones do. We told her we could get her a new battery and/or charger as well as an SD card but she eventually said she just wanted a new phone, so we set her up with a new model that was very similar to her old phone. After we activated it we offered to go through the initial setup with her in-store. I will refer to her as CL.

&gt;Me: ""Okay now we can switch over all of your data like your contacts and apps to your new phone.""  
CL: ""No, it's okay, I'll do that by myself later, that will be easy for me.""  
Me: ""Okay are you sure? We'd be happy to just run through it really quickly here so that you're ready to go.""   
CL: ""No I'll just do that later, I've done it before and it's not hard.""  
Me: ""Okay, have a nice day and let us know if you need anything else!"" 

That brings us to today when she walks in the store

&gt;CL: ""The new phone you sold me isn't working, I can't even get it to turn on."" 

I take the phone and it is in fact turned on and it's still on the initial activation screen where we had it yesterday.

&gt;Me: ""Okay yeah it looks like it still needs to go through the first-time setup so we'll go ahead and do that now.""  
CL: ""Okay well I was on the phone with customer support and they said you guys were already supposed to have done that! That was your job!""  
Me: ""Yes we did ask if we could set it up but you assured us that you wanted to do it later. We can go through it now though."" 

As we started to set it up it turned out she didn't know her Google password, her recovery email or phone number, or the answers to her security questions so we just had to do it without the Google account. We walked her through making a call and she finally left satisfied, but it was crazy how she expected us to do everything perfectly even though she didn't know her own account information and she told us not to m set it up the first time.

alexm42,"I don't want this item, but I'm going to complain about its price anyway.","I'm the assistant front end manager at a chain grocery store and last night I had a rather interesting customer. It started when I was walking in from my lunch break and before I'd even taken my coat off or clocked back in she asked me if there's someone who can help her in the meat department with a sale price. I told her to give me a minute while I clock back in and put my stuff down which was clearly the wrong answer because her tone and expression changed, she said ""ok, I'll be in the meat department, WAITING.""

So when I walked back there, item A that she wanted were advertised at price x but the packages all had a tag that said price y. I took it to a price checker and it scanned at price x. Now for most customers, at this point, problem solved, thank you, have a good evening.

But she turned around and pointed at the natural version of item A that were next to one of the signs that stick up from the cooler, and on the other side of the sign was item B that the sign was for, and asked ""I don't want these ones, but what's the deal with these ones? The sign says B, but would you have to honor this price for me?"" So I told her no, item B is right here, and the sign for natural A is right underneath the item.

So she left and a few minutes later I got a phone call, and the caller hung up when I answered as soon as I said ""this is (my name) speaking."" Couple minutes later, same number on the caller ID, same thing. She called a third time, asked to speak to a manager, I recognized her voice, and *15 minutes* later my manager came out of the office saying he just got off the phone with ""the loony with the meat"" as he described her and asked what happened because she called to complain, about me and about the price of natural item A that I'm reminding you, *she didn't even want in the first place.*

Really the issue was that she wasn't happy about waiting since there's nobody in the meat department that late at night and she didn't like that I didn't drop everything to help her when I wasn't even on the clock yet, so she was looking to cause trouble for me, but thankfully my manager could tell that.",TalesFromRetail,610,1516801622

When I tell them the price the dad has the girl pay for it. She unfolds the bills and puts them down like her items. The dad sees this and tells her that she should put the money in my hand and fully unroll the money to give to me. The kid being like 6 years old says she is sorry for that and just fully delightful the whole time. I tell her it was okay but I make sure give her change back into her hand.

midnightmeow223,"""What do you mean you can't give me money from your drawer?!""","I work as a retail manager at an outdoor attraction. With a spike in temperature, we've seen a bigger attendance then we're used to getting this time of year. Important to the story: We have a collection of the hand-crank penny smashing machines. Guests constantly come into the gift stores to ask for change to use them. 

To set the scene, I am on the register until my sales associate comes in. There is a line and I am working the best I can to provide quick but friendly service. Then enters Rude Dad. RD has two children who are super cute and well behaved (how he got that lucky, I am unsure) RD approaches the counter while I am checking out another guest. 

RD: Hey! Can I get change for the penny machine? 
Me: Hi, yes sir you can but unfortunately you will have to wait in line. 
RD: *huffs and puffs but tugs his kids to the back of the line* 

Eventually it's his turn.

RD: I need change. *throws dollar on counter*
Me: Of course! How would you like it split?
RD: I need four quarters.
Me: *gets four quarters*
RD: oh, and a penny. 
Me: Okay! *takes back a quarter and gives him two dimes and five pennies*
RD: But I need four quarters. 
Me: *is confused at this point and asks for clarification*
RD: I need four quarters. And. A. Penny. 
Me: But sir, you only gave me a dollar....
RD: Okay? I need four quarters and a penny. 
Me: *finally realizing what he's asking* Oh I'm sorry sir, I can't give you a penny. 
RD: What? You can't just give me a penny from your drawer??
Me: *at a loss for words and just shakes head* 
RD: This is ridiculous! With how much money people spend here, you can afford to give up a penny. 
Me: *explains that even if it's just a penny, I could get in trouble for taking money out of the drawer and giving it away* 
RD: *grumbles and turns to leave*

At this point, I am already dumbfounded. Then he turns to his kids and loudly exclaims ""Sorry guys! Looks like we can only make ONE penny!"" and glares back at me. The kids look sad, and then a thought hits me. Just the other day the machine jammed. When they fixed it, Visitor Services gave me the smashed pennies that got stuck to give to the people that complained it was broken.

visoszo,Guy is in a big hurry and is more important than everyone.,"I'm a cashier. At around 9:30, the whole store was winding down for closing at 10:00, and there was only one register open, mine. A woman with two full carts came into the line and began checking out.

An older man carrying a bag of chips and a burrito walked over to the line and stared angrily at the woman being checked out. Then, he furiously started going from register to register, looking for people. While he was doing his little check, a mother and her twenty-something daughter came in and got in line behind the first woman. They only had a couple of items as well.

Angry man comes back. He pushes his way in between first woman and the mother-daughter pair. He yells at me, ""Do you only have one register open?""

I say, ""Yes. I'm sorry, sir, our store is getting ready to close.""

""I only have two items!"" he says. He turns to the lady with the two carts and says, ""I only have two items, why can't I go ahead of you?""

The mother pipes up and says sweetly, ""Oh, I'm sorry, sir, did you want to go ahead of us?""

Man says, ""What?""

She says, ""Oh, you cut us in the line, so clearly you're more important than us, why don't you just go on ahead?""

I work at another store with one of the same guys I worked with at the old store, and he recently told me a story about the old grocery store that I never heard while still there.

So since it's a pretty small store there's one tiny bathroom for employees and customers.  One day when one of the teenage guys was cleaning the bathroom he found an eggplant in the toilet.  He thought it was pretty funny and showed the owners who also thought it was pretty funny, and then they just kind of forgot about it.

However, after that incident it started to happen often.  A few times a week eggplants would start appearing in the little restroom in the garbage, among the decorations, on the counter, etc.  It just so happened that eggplants were going missing from the produce section, so not only was the guy putting eggplants in the bathroom; he was snatching them from the store. 

The management and the owners started to get involved due to being annoyed that they had to throw away all these bathroom eggplants.  Eventually they caught the guy.  When asked why he was putting eggplants in the bathroom he said ""because it's funny.""",TalesFromRetail,1052,1516374769

If we are short-handed, there are also bells set out for folks to tap and get our attention, especially mine, since I don't have a straight eye-line to the front part of the bakery.

She was NOT an employee.  She had pushed her loaded cart past the clearly marked signs at the bakery entrances that stated ""Employees Only"", navigated the 30 or so feet around bakery equipment and tables, past the cooling donuts, and right into the deli area.  I approach her, and try to gently shoo her out and back onto the sales floor.

creepyalfredopasta,The trouble twins,"Warning: this story is a feels trip. Not recommend for anyone out in public or wearing non waterproof makeup.

Working in the same place for years you start to remember the regulars. It also helps when this one regular couple has twin daughters, I've nicknamed the trouble twins, Sara and Amy (names changed).

They earned this nickname not by messing up shelves or anything. They loved to find me in the market area and take turns passing by me and seeing if I can tell which twin it was.

I've known them since I started working but during my second year working at the store, Sara and Amy's parents started showing up less and less (they would have their shopping trips every other Saturday but then it would be 3 or 4 weeks before I see them again). When I did see them I actually started to tell the difference between the twins, Amy wouldn't be walking as fast as Sara and seemed to look more frail.

Next time I see their parents it's without them and after a quick conversation their father tells me that Amy has been diagnosed with a terminal cancer. They haven't been able to shop at my store because they're staying with a family member that lives near the children's hospital where Amy is being taken care of. Last time I saw Amy was right before she was moved to staying at the children's hospital.

I don't see the family for almost a year and when I do Sara isn't running around like she used to and Amy isn't with them. While the parents are looking at cereal Sara comes up to me to say hi and like before I guess which twin she is and say Amy. Sara was silent and looked like she was about to cry but I knelt down and said ""sorry Sara, you know you two are so alike I can't tell even when you're not together.""

Sara was confused  and while her parents are coming to join us I explain to her. ""Just because she isn't here right now doesn't mean I can tell you apart. You two can be on the other side of the world and I'll always get you two mixed up.""

That seemed to cheer her up and she hugged me tightly before her mom came over and did the same with tears in her eyes. She then told me Amy passed away a few weeks ago and Sara was still trying to cope with not having her sister by her side.

Sara and her parents have gone back to their usual shopping routine and when I see Sara I will still sometimes ask if she is Amy which still makes her smile even after it's been years since she played with her twin.

toxic_kitten,I'm in a hurry,"I was working the electronics counter one day, waiting for a backup cashier to come, so that I could go to break and this middle aged biker dude in the middle of his mid-life crisis came running over to me, asking if I could check him out since he was in a hurry. I had no customers at the moment, so I agreed. I ring up his single item, tell him his total and all that.

&gt;me- ""It's asking you a question on the pin pad.""

He looks at the pinpad, drumming his fingers on the counter. 

&gt;dude- ""Can we hurry this up?""

&gt;me- ""You have to touch the pinpad to proceed.""

&gt;dude- ""I don't have to do anything, it's your job.""

So I work in a pretty well known department store as the home supervisor, and this happened about a year ago.

I was going about my business when a co-worker calls me over the walkie saying that a customer needs help getting a towel down off the wall. I'm a tall person so I'm thinking she just needs me to grab one off the top shelf, and so I head over. 

I'll call the customer Empty Threat (ET), and me (me).

ME: ""Hi! How can I help you?""

ET: ""I just need you to grab one of those towels for me."" 

She points to the display towels, which are literally just hand towel sized samples of cloth that are wrapped around a piece of foam to make it look like we have more.

ME: ""Oh I'm sorry, those aren't real. They're just displays.""

ET: ""Well then, I guess you just lost a sale!""

thekraken108,I can’t believe the driver left on time!,"I work in a place that ships packages. Our end of day pickup is at 5:30 PM, but naturally things were busy during the holiday season so the driver would understandably show up late sometimes. No big deal though, he’d still pickup everything and we’d be able to close up on schedule. 

However, now that we’re past the holiday season things have been back on normal schedule. So a couple days ago a woman comes in about 10 minutes past 5:30 and says “I know it’s after 5:30, but is there any chance the driver is running late like he had been during the holidays and I can still get this out today?”

I inform her that unfortunately the driver has already left and that we won’t be able to get her package out till the next day. She then angrily says “That’s ridiculous!” and storms out of the store.

l_om_,Our fault ring got stuck on kids finger,"Okay so I work in jewellery store, we have Christmas sales and obviously kids get some money at Christmas so we see lots of 12-16 year olds buying more than usual. 

When we sell our rings we let them try each ring on to get the right size, some people prefer a bigger size coz their hands are swollen and vice versa.

This kid comes in, buys a ring and tells me it's comfortable, and I always double check with customers and make sure it feels comfortable on. 

Anyways, few days later her mother rings the shop screaming saying the child got the ring stuck on her finger, her whole family were ""up all night"" and apparently had to take a trip to A&amp;E to get ring cut off. Apparently we are to blame
for selling the girl a ring she insisted fit her and shouldn't have done so without her mother present. 

She expects a brand new ring for no extra cost!! 

My manger tells her we can help if she just produces the receipt but the 12 year old kid threw it away.

Colluder,'There's a large dog without a muzzle in the store',"This was about a week ago. I'm a cashier, alone at the front of the store watching the self check, clearing up error messages, and every now and then a customer demands to have a cashier ring them up, or a line forms and I start calling people to my register at the front.

Well an older couple decided it was too hard for them to ring themselves up, and I called them up to help them check out.

Old Lady (OL) immediately starts the conversation by saying 

OL: There's a big dog in the store without a muzzle on. . . I mean a really big dog

To be clear, our store allows dogs inside, but we keep the right to kick them out if they are rowdy.

I give a look of disbelief/apathy thinking ""what does a muzzle have to do with it?"" and start checking them out

OL: Clearly you don't care, but it's a safety hazard and I'm trying to look out for your store. Can you at least tell your manager, maybe he will care.

Me: Of course, I'll call the manager.

Me: Hey Manager, a customer is telling me there's a large dog without a muzzle in the store. Can you come up to the front?

Manager: I'll be right there

This woman will not shut up about how ""if I had a dog that big I'd always keep a muzzle on in public"" and ""it's a really BIG dog"" and ""god forbid if someone got attacked""

My manager comes up and she tells him roughly where the dog was. He heads in that direction then veers back to what he was doing before.

The woman continues on her rant until they leave.

The kicker is that a few minutes later a father and his daughter who is maybe 4 or 5 come up to the register with a bigger dog on a leash (I wouldn't even call it large, maybe a little bigger than your usual lab, certainly no saint Bernard or great dane), and no muzzle. It doesn't even register that this is the dog she was talking about until about halfway through the sale. The dog walked up to the register and lied down while the little girl was all over him, kneeling next to him, hugging him, etc. 

Pretty shocked anyone could mistake that dog for a menace to society.",TalesFromRetail,663,1515561330
PopcornGoddess,Thief doesn't seem to know why her obviously stolen coat makes her so suspicious.,"So it's a couple days before Christmas, and the pharmacy that I work at is swamped with people trying to buy wrapping paper and other such nonsense.  We're in a small lull between waves of customers and this lady comes through the auto doors.  When she comes in she sets off the security alarm, which beeps loudly and say ""please see store associate to complete your transaction"".  

Like anytime this happens I make sure to try and memorize the color of her hair, her general age range, and the color and type of clothing she's wearing.  I flag down a manager as surreptitiously as I can and try to involve the woman in conversation.  She's wearing black, thin, cheap looking clothing under a black fir lined coat that swamps her, and is carrying a large purse.

Me:  ""Oh-no did the door go off when you came in?""

Thief:  ""Yeah, it's no big deal, probably just my coat.""

She reaches up into the collar of her coat and pulls out the clothing tag.  On it is one of those big plastic security tag things that department stores typically use.

In my head I'm like ""ex-squeeze me!  Don't you know how friggen dumb you look now?  If that coat had been acquired legitimately, you would not have that security tag stuck to it, making every automatic door sensor that you go through scream ""THEIF!""

Of course my manager walks up behind her as she is saying this.  My manager crosses her arms and taps her foot and waits for her to finish rambling about her stupid coat.  

Manager:  ""Is there anything that I can help you with ma'am?""

Thief:  ""Oh...No...I think I can find it.""  

She walks farther into the store, and the manager keeps her in her eye sight the entire time.  The thief is showing signs of nervelessness now, looking around constantly, and jumping every time someone else goes down the same aisle that she's on, which is frequently because we were busy, and my manager was on her like white on rice.  

After about fifteen minutes of her wandering the store, as my manger straightens the end of every aisle she goes down, she wanders up front and asks me to help her find something.  I'm checking out a line of customers, and I know that she is trying to get me to distract my manager away from her.  It doesn't work because my manager has camouflaged herself on the other side of the line from where Thief is standing.  

Me:  ""Just a moment ma'am and I can get someone to assist you""

Thief:  Smiles as the manager sneaks around the line and up behind her.

Me:  ""Oh...Manager...There you are.  This lady in front of you is looking for a blabity bloo.  Do you know if we have any blabity bloos?""

Manager:  ""Come with me ma'am and I'll show you where we keep our blabitys and we can see if we have any bloos.""  

A couple minutes later, I see my manager chasing the thief out of the store.  My manager comes back in after about ten minutes.  She shows me the picture of the thief getting into a car and its license plate, that she took with her phone, and tells me that they got in a screaming match.  

A picture of the thief, taken from the security camera that watches the door, now lives below where we hang our work schedule.  On the bottom of the picture has the words, ""kick out on sight!""

Edit:

The way that my store manager has taught us to treat people that we think might be stealing boils down to keeping them in our sight at all times and offering to help them find and purchase things as much as possible.  If they are stealing that makes it so that we have a higher chance of seeing them hide something on their person, and have a reason to accuse them and ask them to leave.  If they don't take anything, it's because they know that they are being watched.  

Most of the time it's easy to spot someone that is planning to earn themselves a five finger discount.  It's in their general body language and how they interact with store employees, or the security guard if the store has one.  It's very hard for me to convey all the symptoms of a thief, because you kind of have to see it to know.  The woman knew that we were suspicious of her as soon as my manager spoke to her the first time.  I could see the panic in her face while my manager and I both were talking to her.  

They both were out of my sight when the woman made the decision to leave.  The manager that dealt with her was the one to make and put up the picture.  I asked her about it when I went to work after posting this.  From what my manager told me about the screaming match, the woman was upset about us being suspicious of her, and my manager was telling her why we thought that she was up to no good.  My manager told me that the woman had cursed at her something awful and threatened her with bodily harm and because of that, my manager, told her that she wasn't welcome in the store.  I didn't question my manager about it earlier, because I saw how sketchy the woman was myself, and I personally didn't think that when my manager said they they fought verbally in the parking lot that it couldn't have been anything other than what she ended up telling me. 

I didn't put all that in the original post because, I didn't witness the ""screaming match"" first hand.  I wasn't sure how kosher that is for this thread.  Everything else that I put in the post, ie what I could see and hear inside the store, was all that I witnessed first hand.  I've read other similar threads on other sites, and most of them have rules about not posting stuff that wasn't a first hand account.  Maybe I should have lurked more.  

Honestly, I thought that my post wouldn't have been questioned like this.  I truly stand by the actions of my manager, the ones that I witnessed first hand at least, and if I hadn't been pinned behind the register checking out customers for most of the time that she was in the store, I would have fallowed the woman around too.  Everything about this woman was sketchy.  ",TalesFromRetail,1487,1515534901
Opeous,Kicking kids out of the store,"I worked as a shift supervisor at a chain pharmacy a few years ago and this is one of the stories that I had that stick out. 

I was working a shift from hell, multiple angry customers, trying to work the weekly truck to the shelves, assisting the pharmacy department with issues, constantly running to the front for issues and to assist with ringing people out.

*Note* There is only two people working the front of the store, a cashier and the supervisor. Which adds to the hell of the shift.

So anyway I was working some product to the shelves when these three kids come in. They are probably around 12 or 13. They have been in multiple times and have never caused to much of a fuss before. 

For some reason today these kids decided to grab some balls from a ball rack we had displayed near the back of the store and Chuck them at the hanging signs from the ceiling that tell you what section you are in (i.e. food, first aid.)

I was in the next aisle to them stocking a bottom shelf and was about to get up to kick then out of the store when this random guy walks past me and says, ""I got this.""

 He then proceeds to walk over to the kids and yell at them to get out of his store and they should have more respect for property. 

The kids leave the store in a hurry and the guy walks back to me and says "" I've always wanted to do that."" 

He then grabs a soda, checks out and leaves.

It was an amazing thing to witness.

abitesizedtaco,Customer corrects my Spanish because I'm not colombian,"So I work in a big box electronics retailer. I made the mistake of saying I am conversational in Spanish so I've gotten forced to help customers in Spanish.  So I was raised by Guatemalan parents so I learned Guatemalan Spanish. I was helping this Colombian lady after I told her my Spanish isn't perfect.  

There's a Spanish dialect where any y or ll is has a j sound instead of a y sound.  It is common in Colombia and not common in Guatemala. this is important for this story for anyone who doesn't know. M will be me, L will be lady. This lady was applying for a credit card so I had to ask for her last name.

M: Tu apellido? ""Your last name?"" (I said this with the Y sound)

L: Apellido! (She said this with the J sound; the Colombian dialect)

So the summary of this interaction is this:

**she corrected my Spanish not because it was wrong, but because I didn't say it in her dialect.**

I just looked at her, shrugged, and said ""soy Guatemalteco"" (I'm Guatemalan)

And interactions like that are why I don't like to speak Spanish at my job.

ShadowMajick,When you think people are being reasonable; they aren't.,"So just for context I work customer service at a big box retailer. I'm working the service counter when this woman comes up and tells me she is there for a store pickup. Get her name, it's an iPad, cool I get her all taken care of. Next she pulls out some headphones that look like they've been used everyday for the past five years and she wants to check if the extended warranty she purchased will cover them. No problem. I look it up and she literally has about six days left on her warranty. 

So she decides that she wants to exchange them for the same exact headphones. Not a problem on my end. This is where it get's ridiculous though. She comes back with the headphones and I'm checking over her receipt. When she originally bought them (almost two years ago) they were $129.99 but were on sale for $90, so she paid like $93 and some change the first time around. Now the same headphones were $109.99 plus tax, so they were technically cheaper than they were before, just not on sale. So I explained we could do the exchange but she would have to pay the difference of $17 and some change. She kept asking me why there was a difference in price when it was the same product and even another color was cheaper. I ended up having to get my manager to explain to her about supply and demand, sales prices and exchanges on altered prices. She was getting EXACTLY the amount she paid for the original headphones to put towards the new ones, it's not our fault they were on sale when you bought them and they aren't now. 

Anyway, in the end she bitched and moaned but ended up paying the $17 and she left. I thought that was the end of it. Nope. About an hour before close she comes back, and starts talking about how ""it just wasn't sitting well with her that a million dollar company couldn't write off $17 after she spent $XX on the iPad."" My manager pretty much told her if her headphones weren't TWO YEARS old she probably would have written it off, but her warranty expired in 6 days anyway and we allowed her the exchange as per the extended warranty policy in the original amount she paid. Everyone knows when a product is replaces it is at EQUAL or LESSER value, unless you agree to pay the difference. So she literally ends up returning the iPad, the new headphones and throwing the old ones at ME while giving us all a lecture about how she worked retail for 12 years and this isn't how you handle customers and blah blah blah. 

I risked my life driving in the snow for that. ",TalesFromRetail,816,1515409315

So this just happened...

I live in Mexico and i work in a computer rental, (we also have other services like copies, sell headphones and all of that stuff but it doesn't really matter since this guy only used a computer).

i have the opening shift and since the second i started opening the door this guy (i'll call him DG for dollar guy) got really close to me like i was going to let him in (i still had to clean a bit and count the  money on the till).

That didn't really bothered me since it always happens, but the moment he came in i immediately knew he was going to be difficult customer.

* He was so LOUD, he was singing, cursing and yelling. He didn't seemed to care he was not the only one there, me and the other customers where annoyed with this guy but i didn't want to call him out because i had a bad feeling and i was the only one working.

* DG kept demanding me to bring him ashtray, even though **they were right in front of him** (i probably was in the wrong here, i should have give it to him but i was stubborn and wanted him to take it himself...)

* And the last straw, when the time to pay came this happened:


DG: *hands me a dollar*

Me: ...sorry sir but we can't accept this currency

DG: Why not?

Me: ...we use pesos, that's american currency

DG: But it's real!

Me: im sorry sir but we can't accept it, you'll have to exchange it.

DG: But it's REAL!


This kept going for a while until he left to exchange it, i honestly though he was not coming back but...yeah.
Eventually the manager from the next door store, who since im the only worker here somethimes comes and helps us with ´situations´, came and asks me about DG, apparently he tried to exchange the dollar there too.

In the end DG comes back and the manager told me to accept it, we can exchange it anyway.


Now i just have to wait for my boss and explain why we have a dollar on the till.

degeneratesfault,Customers made me cry,"This happened on the 23rd of December.

So I was cashing out an older lady on my till on the, I finish and tell her her total, she tries to pay with a debit card. She begins having problems with her pin, she says she needs to re-try it, she proceeds to try 3 times. After 3 failed pin attempts, the system will not allow that card to be used because of security reasons obviously and I explain this to her. 

There's an ATM near my till so she goes to pull out money, but she cannot remember her PIN number. A line was already building throughout the whole thing, and people witnessing her problem. The couple in line behind her decided to pay for her entire purchase ($130-$150) can't remember exact amount. I started crying because I couldn't believe they did that, and I strongly believe they did it because they're genuinely good people. 

I know this couple because they work at the local high school, the woman is the school's principal and the man is the student success counsellor. So LITTLE back story: me and my boyfriend graduated back in June, and at the grad it was our last opportunity to purchase our graduation photos. My family paid for mine, my boyfriend's couldn't pay for his, and I couldn't pay for his either, so he just forgot about it. Then in July in the mail came his photos, with a letter from the principal about how he should have these photos and she wishes him well in his future! She most likely paid for them out of her own pocket also.

They are obviously very good people, I have two more good stories about them if anyone's interested.

madeofstarlight,“YOU Still Could Have Said Hi!!!!”,"I work at a major warehouse-style retailer at our service desk. I like my job and I enjoy my position most of the time. We have had an influx of thefts recently. As per our policy, we can’t walk after anyone, but we record detail about the theft. This becomes relevant when my overreacting customer (who comes in often and is always unpleasant) comes to my line. 

I’ll be M and OC will be overreacting customer. 

M: “Hi there, how can I help you today? Are you purchasing or returning?”
OC walks up and slams his stuff down. As this happens, I watch someone walk out my door with product. My eyes obviously shift from OC to thief. 
OC: “EXCUSE ME?! I’m the customer! You didn’t say hi to me and I’m RIGHT HERE!!!”
M: “Oh, I’m sorry sir, I apologize. How can I help you today?” 
OC: (glaring) “I have a return” as he shoves it at me. 
We go through the returns process, but he starts demanding to know why I didn’t acknowledge him (although I did, twice). 
M: “Sir, I’ve already apologized. I also had my eye on the door since a theft occurred while you were approaching.”
OC: “You’re telling me someone walked out with your product while I was standing here?”
M: “Yes, they did.”
OC: (getting loud) “YOU STILL COULD HAVE SAID HI!!!! Your explanation was even ruder than you not saying anything!!! You’re just trying to be right!!! I’m going to (Competitor)!”
M: “Again, I apologize. I hope you have a better day, sir.”
He continues yelling about me being rude and I can’t hear the next customer who is in front of me. I turn to him, “Excuse me, I can’t hear my next customer. Our transaction is over.” I keep a pleasant tone, but he’s irritating as hell. 

He leaves, but he’ll be back. They never give us the luxury of taking their purchases and returns elsewhere. ",TalesFromRetail,643,1515169394

ifeeltresbon,Kids are a blessing,"So this just happened less than an hour ago and it's still affecting me right now.

I work in a retail store at the register, and I'm on my afternoon shift when I see who my next customers are: three little girls who want to be all adult-like and buy books for themselves thanks to grandma's money (Grandma is right behind them in case they need more cash). They all individually want to pay for their stuff and, since they're behaving so well and are just so cute, I'm just smiling like a goof because I love kids like that. Then, as soon as the first girl passes by me, the youngest of the bunch (probably no older than 7, I'm bad with ages) leans slightly over the counter and looks at me, and she just says this.

&gt;""Miss, you're very pretty!""

I just about melted on the spot since it felt so sincere and she was really sweet about it. I complimented her back by telling her she was just as cute, which was true, and they did their stuff after paying.

Blearky,"""I've paid too much! And you're going to fix it!""","This happened about a week before christmas in a budget clothing retailer, the busiest period when none of us can really afford to stay with one customer for too long.    
When all 14 registers are on in my department, and the queue still isnt going down, we tend to have all managers and supervisors behind the tills helping bag pack and correct prices, so we're able to keep a pretty good watch for problems.
   
On this particular occasion, one of the managers was helping pack for a man and two women who I assume were his wife and mother. They'd brought 8 wheeled baskets of stock (*and our baskets are pretty big*), ammounting to about a £400 sale as everything they'd picked up was reduced (*we're talking 100-200 items*). During the transaction, they questioned every single item and made the manager double check the prices, correcting them for a small handful that went through wrong.  
   
Finally they paid and that should have been the end of it, but then they proceeded to come back and wait at the end of the tills until another manager waived me over and asked me to deal with it so she wouldnt get tied up with them. 
  
  
    
**And this is when it got tedious.**

Starting with ""*I've paid too much, I want my money back!*"" the already **Angry Man** then admitted he didnt know how much he'd been overcharged by or on what items.  
  
**I told him:** ""*Okay, then I'll have to check your receipt against what you've bought to see if all of the prices are correct*""  
  
**Angry Man:** ""*NO! get a calculator and add everything up*""  
   
**Me:** ""*Sir the till is a calculator, if I add all the prices on the receipt the total will be the same, I need to know what items went through wrong to find out how much you've been overcharged*""   
   
**AM:** ""*NO! DO IT AND GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK, YOU'VE STOLEN*""
    
**Me:** ""*I want to help you, I can't give you your money back if I have no idea how much money it is*""  
   
All the while, I was pretty certain he hadn't been overcharged, but this went on for about 15 minutes until his mother finally intervened and convinced him that letting me see the receipt was the only way they'd possibly get a refund.   
   
Unfortunately until this point, I didnt realise they'd bought 8 baskets worth of merchandise. It should have been relatively straightforward however to go through every bag, and tick every item off the receipt if it was the correct price. 
  
Even more unfortunately, **Angry Man** didn't trust me to do this, **Angry Man** thought I'd *steal more* somehow. This meant that for every item I checked, I had to deal with **Angry Man** standing way too close with his bad breath, so he could check the item off the receipt too. 
And just to make things a little more interesting, items appear on our receipts as codes, not names, and that code appears roughly in the centre of a few tiny lines of codes on our tags.   
   
**Angry Man** did not want to learn where this code was on the tag, and required me to point to it on every one, then where it appeared on the receipt, and let him double check it until he was satisfied enough for me to move on.   
   
I'll spare you the details of the next HOUR of my life, but it involved a lot of **Angry Man** breathing in my face, turning to yell at his wife in a foreign language I didnt recognise (*he was however clearly fluent in english and had a local accent, there were no language barrier issues here*), and towards the end as he got increasingly more bored and agitated with the process that he'd created, he started repeating what I said in a singsong voice and copying my accent to mock it. These are just the highlights.    
   
**Eventually we finished going through the receipt, and surprise surprise, obviously everything was correct.**  
   
But **Angry Man** wasnt happy, he'd still paid too much, he still wanted me to fix it.   
Eventually I realised the only way to get rid of him was to somehow convince him to return some of his purchase. **Angry Man** was okay with this and briefly became just **Disgruntled Man**, but then I had to break the news to him that only the customer service desk was capable of returns, not the regular registers.  
    
Fortunately **Angry Man's** mother was tired of hanging around by this point and persuaded him once more to follow me upstairs to the customer service desk, where we skipped the queue and opened a till specially for him to return £150 of discounted goods that we'd have to put back out later.   
It took some convincing to get him to understand that the money would be back on his card within three days, but he eventually left, ladies in tow, yelling at the top of his voice in that same foreign language, for some reason.   
   
Some might say I should have done things differently, maybe I should have confronted Angry Man on his behaviour, but to be fair, he did get me an hour and a half away from the christmas rush, so that was nice of him.
     
I still took my break right after.
     
**TL;DR: Paranoid customer buys way too much discounted stock, has some kind of spending crisis or something, tries to make it my fault, I appease his demands instead of challenging his behaviour and waste an hour and a half of both of our time.**",TalesFromRetail,737,1514997974
retailtherapy6991,"""If a customer tells you something is cheaper, you honor it-""","I had a doozy of a customer a few days ago, and I'm still shaking my head about it. I haven't posted in some time, but I definitely have some stories saved up from over the holiday season, because people were just *rude*. Anyway, on to the story. 

For some background, I work in an apparel department of my store, mainly on the register. I was on the register a few nights ago when this story took place. I had been sick all day, but decided to come into work, I couldn't afford to call out again. Customers had actually been pretty good that night, I think they could tell that I was sick, for which I was grateful. But not this woman, oh no, not her. 

It was probably 9:30, when this middle age woman comes up to my counter to buy some items. She had a few shirts from the mens department, as well as some workout pants, and a few small bottles of wine. 

I start ringing her things up and she has a coupon for buy one get one free for the mens shirts. I scan everything, total it and then apply the coupon. I tell her her total, and she just stares at the screen in that way that only true pain in the ass customers can. I knew she was going to have a problem the moment she opened her mouth, but what came out surprised me, because she was so bold. 

She'll be B, for Bold... and maybe some other things. I'll be me for me of course. :)

&gt;B: ""So, that's not enough of a discount after that coupon. I want more."" 

I really wasn't sure what she could mean. I was really confused. 

&gt;Me: ""Um, well everything rang up at the price it was supposed to. I don't really know what you mean by not enough of a discount. Everything the coupon applied to, it took off.""

&gt;B: ""Yes, but, it's still not enough. I thought it would work on the pants as well."" 

The coupon in question clearly states 'young men and mens shirts'. There isn't anything on the coupon anywhere saying anything about pants, so why she thought that beats me. 

&gt;Me: ""Oh, I see. The coupon is only applicable to mens shirts... there isn't a coupon for pants this week."" 

She kind of narrowed her eyes at me, but didn't say anything else, so I figured that was it. I repeated her total again, and very politely, I may add. She ignored me and asked where our New Year's Eve jewelry was. We didn't and still don't really have any jewelry for New Year's Eve, only really Christmas. I don't know why, but we don't. I told her this, kind of confused as to why the conversation had gone that direction, since I had finished ringing her out and everything was bagged. 

&gt;B: ""Well, do you have any like costume jewelry or stuff like that?"" 

I told her that yes we did and gave her directions to where they were, assuming she would go look once the transaction was completed. I was totally wrong. 

Without another word to me, she books it in the direction that I had explained to her, and leaves me with an unfinished transaction, me sick as hell in general and getting sick of her weird wishy washy attitude. Add to the fact that I had customers that had just lined up after she walked away, and I was downright pissed off. I explained to the other customers what happened and told them that they could check out in the front at the main check stands if they would like but they didn't mind, thankfully. I waited and waited, probably five minutes (I don't know why the other customers stayed in line, I would have left long before then) when the woman came back all of a sudden, holding two little wallet clutches that were sparkly. Pretty good for New Years Eve, even if they didn't say anything about NYE on them. 

&gt;B: ""I found these. Add them to my total."" 

&gt;Me: ""Sure thing!"" 

So I added them to her transaction, put them in the bag with the rest of her items, and told her her new total. She stared at the screen again, this time really scrutinizing it, and I could feel my soul leave my body with how annoyed I was. 

&gt;B: ""No, those aren't cheap enough. Those jewelry bag things are supposed to be half off."" 

I knew how this was going to go, right then and there, and I just wasn't having it. I felt bad for the other customers in line, but there was no way I was going to let this woman get away with me adjusting the price of something I knew full well wasn't on sale. 

&gt;Me: ""Ma'am, the jewelry is actually regular priced right now. It's not on sale, I'm sorry.""

&gt;B: ""Um, so what was the sign over there then? It *said* 50% off all holiday jewelry."" 

The answer lied within her question. All *holiday* jewelry. Which is not what she had. She may have been using it for that purpose, but it wasn't actually holiday jewelry. I explained that to her, this time a little less friendly than I had been. The woman in line behind her, who had stayed through her taking her sweet time shopping finally gave up and walked away, so it was down to us again. 

&gt;B: ""Well, that's false advertising."" 

If I ever hear those words uttered again in my life, it will be too soon. There are so many damn customers who just think that something is false advertising because they are too ignorant to realize what they're getting isn't included in a sale. I couldn't stop myself again. 

&gt;Me: ""Can you explain to me how exactly it's false advertising when the sign back there is only on top of the holiday jewelry, when these clutches you got were nowhere near there, as well as full price? I don't understand."" 

She just rolled her eyes at me, but didn't say anything in response. I asked her if she would still like them, and I think out of spite, she still took them. I repeated her total for what felt like the 8th time. I mean, at this point I had spent almost 20 minutes with her at the register, and I had other things I needed to do in my department. 

She looked at the damn screen *again* all scrutinizing it. I knew she was looking for anything else that had an imaginary discount she had conjured out of her ass, and she found one, with the men's workout pants. 

&gt;B: ""Uh, yeah, so those pants were supposed to be 50% off.""

It was like she had to get something discounted. There was no way she was going to leave without getting *something* for cheaper than our already insane sale prices. Also, our mens workout pants, especially the brand she had, were definitely not 50% off, they were 30% and the reason I know that is because I had set the ad for mens athletic wear that week. 

&gt;Me: ""Ma'am, I'm sorry to inform you, but no, they're not. They're only 30% off this week. I set the ad myself, so I definitely remember that."" 

She just sighed heavily, definitely annoyed, but at least she didn't fight it. I waited for her to scrutinize the screen even more, but alas she finally pulled money out of her monstrosity of a purse. I almost cried from joy. 

Right as she was about to hand me the money for the purchase, she did something so unthinkable, I'm still unable to fully process it. She looked at the screen one last time, looked at me, then the  bagged merchandise, put her money back in her wallet and said. 

&gt;B: ""You know what, I really don't want any of this stuff anymore. You've argued with me over every price I've told you, and it's just made it so I don't want to give you my money. You've lost a customer.""

&gt;Me: ""I'm *so* sorry you feel that way, however, this is a business, and I can't just take your word for every price you think something should be, especially when I set the sale ads myself. If you think something should be cheaper, maybe customer service would be the better way to go. Hope you have a better night."" 

&gt;B: ""I'm just saying. If a customer tells you something is cheaper, you honor it-""

Now, I did something very unprofessional here, and I'm going to be honest, I shouldn't have said what I said. But I had been sick all week, and I was very angry and just wasn't having it. 

&gt;Me: ""Let me stop you there. I will never take a customer's word for it, or honor a price blindly. Expecting me to just do that, especially with such large adjustments is ridiculous. You've had an issue with everything I've rang up for you, because you didn't read the sale signs accurately, and that is not my fault. I won't adjust prices for you because you choose to ignore and pick and choose what you want. Have a good night."" 

I stayed at my register as she walked away. I honestly expected her to go straight to customer service but instead she walked out the door. She had muttered quite a few rude remarks but I didn't care, I was too pissed off. Yes, I shouldn't have said what I said, but I'm sorry, this is a business. I don't care that you think I should honor random prices you pull out of your ass because you want stuff to be cheaper. If you want cheaper prices, you know where to shop, and it's not at my higher end store. People have been getting *very* shady lately with prices, and haggling and I'm not doing it. I think I could have handled the situation better, but honestly what else was there to do? I had to stick to my guns and I'm glad I did. If I get talked to by a manager, I'll just explain what happened, and I know they'll have my back. 

I'd rather lose a sale from an illiterate thief who would only be paying half the price than an honest customer who actually reads the sales and pays attention, as well as the regular price, and who doesn't try to swindle my store.",TalesFromRetail,3387,1514945821

She's probably no more than three years old and always try to get my attention whenever her and her family go shopping, no matter what.

writer_of_mysteries,"""Postage is postage""","Alright. I'm working at a 3rd party, small business that handles mail for several different services. We basically exist to save some time instead of going to the post office and waiting for at least an hour.

This story starts a few days after Christmas. This older lady comes into the store, wanting to ship something to Texas. After I get the information imputed into my system, I start reading off her options. Cheapest is postal service, taking about a week or so. Usually is for boxes under 12 x 10 x 7 or so.

Lady starts freaking out over the price. Her cheapest option is about $8.00 or so, more expensive than $3-4 dollars at the post office. Considering you're paying a bit more to escape hour long lines, most people don't really care, choosing to spend a bit more money to save some time.

She walks out, saying she'll call whoever she's sending it to and find out what she wants to do.

And I thought it was done.

A few days pass, and the lady comes back, with her thing to ship in a bubble pack envelope, bulging in weird places, likely due to some item of clothing. I didn't ask.

I start re-inputing the information, give her the same price as the other day. She nods this time, and hands me..... A book of stamps.....

I ask why she's giving me stamps, as we sell our own stamps at the store, and I can't accept other stamps to sell, as we buy our own stock to sell. She explains that she's going to pay for the shipping with the stamps.

My head begins to hurt. I try to explain that my system can create a shipping lable (think of those return labels amazon and other companies give you), and as a result she can keep her stamps and pay with a card or cash.

She then proceeds to explain that she should be able to pay for the postage with the stamps. ""Stamps are postage, the label is postage, postage is postage, so I should be able to pay for it with the stamps!""

I try to explain that my system doesn't work that way, and that I don't have an option to exchange different types of postage, and as a result can't accept her stamps as payment for the label.

She then proceeds to curse me out, tell me that she has no idea how I got this job, because I'm ""clearly incompetent"", and ""don't know how stamps and postage work"", and goes on about how if the envelope were covered completely with stamps, I would need to accept the package.

Migraine growing, I try to explain that if it were flat rate, or a letter, then yes, I would be capable of accepting an envelope covered in stamps, but due to the size and bulk of the envelope, it would need package rate.

She curses me out some more, giving me double birds, and eventually leaves. The moment my replacement came, I left without a word.

In what world do stamps equal money?",TalesFromRetail,718,1514734223
rebeccarenee6,She called another store to tattle on us.,"I used to work at the customer service desk at a department store. There was one particular instance I look back on from my time there and thank everything that I no longer have to deal with this level of toddler-like behavior from adults.  

I was working the desk one day and a guy comes up to me wanting to return a shirt for his wife. No problem. I go to return the shirt and tell him the (around 20ish dollars) would go back to the card she purchased it on. He gets a little upset, but it wasn't anything unbearable and explains that they already paid off the card and she would want the money back in cash. I explain to him that our store policy won't allow that. We can only return items back to their original tender or we could do in-store credit if he likes. This isn't good enough for him and he tells me that he's going to have his wife come back and she won't be happy. I think, ""whatever, I'll probably be gone by the time she comes back, so not my problem"". I was wrong.

About half an hour later, in comes this woman, who is immediately raging. She throws her bagged shirt on the desk and demands to speak to a manager. I'm confused at first, but then I see her husband (the man I dealt with half an hour prior) strolling in behind her. There's no way I'm about to deal with this, so I go to call a manager over for her.  

At this particular time, there were two managers on shift. I refused to call Manager 1 (M1), as I knew she would give in to them right away since she only ever cares about making sure the customer doesn't tattle to her boss (which often meant that she let customers get away with anything and everything in the book). Manager 2 (M2), on the other hand, has a backbone and I knew would stand up to these people, so I call her over.  

M2 comes over to the desk and the lady instantly starts going off on M2 for not allowing her to get cash back and claims that our other store (about 45 minutes away from this store) allows her to get cash back all the time. M2 explains to her exactly what I explained to her husband, but the lady is still not having it.  

The lady is still screaming at M2 and then asks M2 if there's any other managers in the store she can speak with. Knowing full well if M2 admits M1 is in the store, the customer will get her way. After what seemed like minutes of anticipation, M2 tells the customer that she's the only manager in the store. The lady didn't believe her and got beyond irritated, took her bagged shirt, and chucked it at M2 before snatching it back quickly and walking away.  

M2 and I stare at each other in disbelief, assuming that the worst of it was over. It was not over. A few minutes pass by, M2 walks into the break room (the door is right next to the service desk), and I move on to helping other customers. Then the phone rings. I answer it and hear, ""Hi, this is (manager) from (store 45 minutes from our store). Can I speak to your manager?"" This lady called the other store to tell on us for following our own store policy. Great. This is definitely not over.  

M1 must've picked up the line because moments later she walks back to the service desk with crazy lady (who had the biggest ""I'm about to get my way"" grin I've ever seen) and husband in tow. M1 proceeds to pull out the cash for her (which remember, this was only a 20ish dollar shirt all of this is over).  

At that moment, M2 walks out of the break room. Crazy lady sees her and takes this opportunity to throw her even further under the bus to M1 and tells M1 that ""it was funny because M2 said she was the only manager in the store when I asked to speak to another manager"".  

This was over an hour long process from the moment the lady stepped into the store all over getting 20ish dollars back in cash, but she got her way. Both managers walked back to the office after that and I overheard M2 getting upset with M1 about not backing up her or other employees, as M1 told M2 that she needed to be nicer to customers.  

After that, I knew I was done with retail.    ",TalesFromRetail,1949,1514649436

Now, we seel other things than just hardware, like appliances, electronics, and housewares. Yesterday, I was manning the customer service desk by the appliances and electronics when this middle-aged guy grabs one of the closeout Bluetooth speakers off the shelf, sits down in one of the outdood chairs, and starts messing with the speaker. He opens the package, grabs the speaker, connects it with his phone, and starts playing music. I just assumed that he was making sure he liked it before he boght it, but he put it back in the packaging and came up to me and complained about it. He'll be G and I'll be M.


G: You really shouldn't be allowed to sell returned items. It's dangerous.


M: Sir, we re-sell returned mercandise all the time and no one has ever complained about it. This speaker is also brand new.


G: No it's not, look at these fingerprints. What if someone with diseased hands touched that? You would be spreading it then. What if someone put a tracking device in ther, you know? It's just too dangerous.


M: Sir, I watched you mess with it.


G: If you're going sell it, you should discount it 30%.


M: Sir, the item is already discounted from $74.99 to $59.99.


G: Whatever. I'm leaving.


Obviously this guy tried to rip us off by guilt tripping us. Our margin is pretty thin on electronics, so the speaker was discounted as far as we could. 


TL;DR Guy tried to convince us to sell returned merchandise at a 30% discount and got mad when I caught him tampering with an item to make it look returned.

talkingtomiranda,"""Did not hire me. One star.""","Hi fellow retail slaves! I have a surplus of Christmas bile I haven't yet vented, so I'm back. This is a rare horrible employee/customer story! (Also, I'm working on my formatting; please be kind!)

---

We only recently opened my store, the first one in my city, and demand was... unexpected. Like, at *least* twice as busy as the company had expected. My manager called and (politely) screamed until we got the go-ahead to hire extra seasonal staff.

My regional manager and my store manager (SM) set up camp in a nearby cafe and interviewed for 2 days straight. Given that they interviewed roughly 20 people in 2 days, they did pretty well sticking to the schedule, but occasionally they ran a few minutes late; not a huge deal. Unless...

**Very Important Candidate** (bold because you guys *need to know* how very important he is) came into the store for his interview. My bosses were running a little behind, so SM asked me to let him know it'll be about 5 minutes, and they'll come and get him. I went back, apologised and asked **VIC** to wait. **VIC** seemed displeased but hey, interviews run a little late sometimes. SM came and got him shortly, only a couple of minutes after his interview was scheduled to start.

Now, because I was running the store, I didn't get to hear **VIC's** answers, but I understand that pretty much NONE of them were up to scratch. Lots of undertone that suggested ""what can YOU do for me?"" and not the other way around. So he didn't exactly cover himself in glory.

Maybe we shouldn't have been surprised when the final question - ""So, do you have any questions for us?"" - rolls around. **VIC** looks my SM dead in the eye and says coldly, 
&gt;""Yes. Why did you keep me waiting 5 minutes.""

**VIC** was not offered the position.

About a week later, my manager and I have gone to offer for everyone else, and are organising training for the new hires. Out of nowhere, one of our team pops out the back to tell us Google has the wrong number for our store. It's correct; I confirmed it when she told me the same thing last week, but fiiiiine.

I pull up the same search result to show her that the information is, indeed, correct. (It is. Duh.) Alongside our store info, our Google review score pops up: 3 stars. We were 5 stars a couple of days ago; what's changed? 

Two reviews: one is 5 stars, and one is 1 star. It's just 1 star with non comment, so I don't even know what we've done wrong! I'm annoyed, I can't fix something if I don't know what it is.

But my manager is furious. She recognises the name.

&gt;""That's **VIC**. I guess you can't put 'They didn't give me a job' as a reason for a 1 star review.""

(I don't know how or who or why or anything, but that review has been taken down, and our good rating has been restored. However, retail is a small world and this is a small town. Three friends who are managers for different companies have blacklisted him after I told them about this, and I'm sure they'll tell *their* friends. The moral of the story is: don't fuck with us.

And I still don't know wtf my loopy team member was googling to get the wrong phone number.)

Cranky middle aged lady comes in asking about the big tree and before I can say anything she says: I mean it’s half dead and a few days before Christmas so I expect to get a discount.” Customers do not understand what PBS (pay by scan) is or don’t care.  I told her we don’t own the trees and we aren’t allowed to mark them down.

I swear it looked like I insulted her family or something but she went full on psycho on me demanding compensation for her wasted time (seriously).  In an effort to get away I offered her the big tree for the price of the next lowest tree (which is like a $30 discount).  After I said this she says: “Ok but I want to look around some more before I decide.”  And she just leaves after all the fussing.

Fast forward two days later and she shows back up asking for the tree.  I told her it was sold and she started throwing a fit again demanding where it was.  I told her it had been two days since we last talked and she never asked for me to hold it either.  She then asked for the managers name and number, I guess to complain about not getting a tree for free or at a discount days before Christmas.  Let’s see if anything ever becomes of this lol.",TalesFromRetail,2795,1514244938
SundancerSky94,I NEED A SMALL HAM,"Ok, so i work in a grocery store and although Christmas eve really wasn't that bad,  this woman just, ugggg.

It was about 5:40pm. I am working behind the service desk at my store, where i answer the phone, to a frantic woman looking for a small ham. 

She requested the deli or meat department, which normally would be fine, except there was nobody in eathier place, but i put her on hold and paged the deli anyway. At that point the manager was in front of me and told m that nobody is in those departments because they had gone home for the holiday. 

Her call rang back and i had told her (in th nicest way possible) that there isn't anybody in those departments because our store closes in 20 minutes. She then proceeded to scream at me, and talk extra slow (because in her eyes I'm stupid and don't understand English). 

Her: I.....KNOW.....YOU.....CLOSE....SOON.... THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING SO I CAN RACE OVER THERE AND GET ONE. 

So i in turn, paged a manager and let him deal with it. At 6pm, we closed and I was asked to go outside and guard the exit door, so people don't keep coming in the store. I was out there nicely instructing people that the store had been closed, and wishing them a Merry Christmas. 

Here comes this little short thing up to the door with a phone that was almost bigger then her head. I had given her my apologies and said that we were closed. She started screaming at me and pushed past to get into the store, yelling about just talking to the manager. 

So i shrug it off. Until the manager came out and asked me what her deal was. I explained how all that woman did was scream at me. After all this i found out that the manager was also treated like trash and sworn at. This woman threw the biggest tizzy, like why? 

All over a ham that weighed maybe 5lbs. For her the lady's two cats. -_-

ITry17,WHATS HER NAME?!,"So I work in a store that relies on the seasonal period, with Christmas being the biggest one for us. 

When it gets to these really busy periods we have to set in rules to ensure that tasks get done. 

One of these rules is till busting, where one person stays on till by themselves until the queue is of four or more people. Then they’ll call for someone else to jump on. 
The moment the queue drops that person will jump off and go back to their original task. 

I was called on the tills forcing me to abandon some stock on the shop floor. Which isn’t a big deal usually but it is at Christmas. 

I served all the customers and there was two people left and one of them turned around to me and we had the following conversation. 

Customer: are you not going to serve me? 

Me: sorry love, I’ve got to get back to my other job but my colleague over there is almost finished up she’ll be another 30 seconds. 

I was actually going to turn back onto the tills because I felt bad but at that point I realised that there was another lady needing my attention so I went to her. I then wanted to sort my stock out because I was worried someone would fall over. A few minutes later my colleague called me over. 

Colleague: that lady, she gave you the dirtiest look ever. She looked as if she was going to hit you. 

Me: oh, that’s not good 

Colleague: and she wanted to know your name. But I told her I wasn’t at liberty to say anything and if she wanted I could get the manager. I explained why you jumped off but she didn’t care. 

Me: this isn’t good at all. 

Colleague: she didn’t want to speak to the manager she just wanted to know your name so she could complain. I refused. 

We ended up telling the manager on duty what happened and she reminded us how I was following company rules and as I was polite I can’t be condemned. 

Still it isn’t nice when you’re doing what you’re told to do by your company and it causes customers to complain... but props to my colleague for sticking up for me xx",TalesFromRetail,2031,1514071867
MarioneTTe-Doll,"No, ma'am, I'm not taking pictures of women in their underwear.","My wife and I are visiting my parents for the holidays, and somehow we got on the topic of women's underwear, which reminded my parents (and myself) of an incident at a job I had back in high school.

It was at a big-name clothing store, just after the holidays, and we were marking down the leftover Christmas items. I, a male, was currently working on some women's underwear, scanning, printing, and moving to the next while lost in my own little world and thinking nothing of it. At the time, I was using one of the smaller hand-scanners that looked a bit like the (then modern-day) digital cameras looked like.

All of a sudden, I hear some stifled laughter, and my manager's voice assuring an elderly woman that I was *not* taking pictures of the underwear.

I turn around to see the store manager, several assistant managers, our LP guy, and two of the big guys on our truck crew standing there looking both relieved and amused.

Once they explained to her what I was doing and why (and after they pulled me off that job and had a female co-worker take over), the manager explained to me that the woman had come to them in a panic, claiming that I was taking pictures of women's underwear. 

The manager thought she meant upskirt or similar shots, and rallied a few people as support for safety, only for her to point me out as I was scanning the barcodes and putting the new price stickers over the old.

Our LP guy did check our cameras for safety reasons, but we all had a bit of a chuckle about it after.

**Edit ::** I just got back from dinner with the family, and realize that there's a bit of confusion due to me not putting in a timeframe.

derbeaner,"""Where the f*** are your phones?!""","So this happened to me a few hours ago. I work for a cell phone carrier. We use iPads to do our transactions so we are pretty much all over the store on any available surface working face to face with our customers. 

Today, I was helping this lady buy some phones for her kids for Christmas gifts. I was not on a table since we were super packed and busy for the holidays. I was on a counter that had some display phones on it, and its normal that if I'm quietly doing something a random customer will ask me a quick question, and I will politely answer their question or point them in the direction of someone that can help them if I'm too busy and let them know I'm helping someone. If I'm talking I usually won't be interrupted by randoms. This random old man in a suit and a peacoat wearing some thick, slicked back, black toupee interrupted me while I was actually talking. 

I will be me and random customer will be RC.

&gt;Me: *explaining bill charges to customer*

&gt;RC: *taps my arm* ""Hey! Where the *FUCK* are your phones?!

&gt;Me: Excuse me sir, I'm with a customer right now, and I would really appreciate it if you didn't use that language in my store. There are kids behind you.

&gt;RC: Hey man, I'm just joking. But really where are the ph-?

I cut him off

&gt;Me: I'm not joking. I don't think my customer appreciates hearing that kind of language. *points* the iPhones are over there and the rest are all over the store.

RC just stood there saying something about how he wasn't gonna be talked to like that by some kid but I had already walked away. 



I apologized to my customer and we were already done anyway I was just summarizing what we went over that day. I walked her out and I went to go take my lunch and the guy was looking at me as I walked out of the store. 



You're gonna be rude to me, old man, I'm gonna be rude back. I don't care that you're old, we're both men and I didn't disrespect you at all for you to be talking to me like that.

the_black_madrigal,What would you have me do?,"Years ago I worked for a large pharmacy chain as front end management. One night I'm closing alone and a guy walks in with 5 minutes to spare. Good for him he seems to know both what he needs and where it is. 

He speed walks up to the counter with a bunch of medical supplies, gauze, disposable ice packs etc... I ring everything up and give him his total. He pats his pockets and begins to look concerned. ""I forgot my wallet"" he says in disbelief ""what do I do?"" he asks me. 

""Look, we close at 9pm but I'm going to be here about 20 minutes past that, cleaning up. I'll leave a register on until 9:20. Go home, get your wallet, and come back here. Good?"" 

Then he tells me he lives about 15-20 minutes away and can't make it back in less than 40 minutes. ""Sorry man"" I say as I take the items off the counter and void the sale. 

He leaves and I lock up. I think nothing else of it. 

The next time I worked my store manager asks me ""did a man come in here the other night, close to closing time trying to buy medical supplies?"" Of course I remember him and I tell the manager what happened. She proceeds to tell me his wife called and complained and corporate was (of course) very apologetic on my behalf. Then she tells me corporate wants me to apologize to these people directly. 

I paused for a second to collect myself ""you want me to apologize to someone who was not a customer, for not giving them free merchandise, when you would have fired me for giving them free merchandise?"" I think the absurdity clicked for the store manager at this point. She lowered her eyes and uttered ""they made me give them a $25 gift card as an apology for HIM forgetting HIS wallet."" 

I think it broke my store manager's soul a little when she realized corporate would never back us up no matter how right we were. ",TalesFromRetail,1158,1513813541
snortybeagle,That's what happens when you stab something...,"So, I currently work for a small company that makes custom goods such as t-shirts, bags, mugs, etc. People get to order stuff with their logos and designs for parties, company retreats, etc.

We have a physical office and a website where people can see a catalog and place orders.

Yesterday, this lady came in, irate, claiming that we shipped her damaged goods. She placed a box on the counter and the first thing I noticed was that the box had been unceremoniously torn open.

I opened the box and pulled out the merchandise. She had ordered custom tote bags for a friend's baby shower event. It was a stack of about 15 or 20 bags and the first few had jagged cuts in them, like someone had snipped them with scissors or a blade. I was completely baffled as to how that could have happened. 

I was about to apologize when it suddenly occurred to me that the box was opened in a way that suggested brute force. It literally looked like it had been attacked by an animal.

&gt;Me: Did the box arrive this way at your home?

&gt;Customer: No.

&gt;Me: What happened to it then?

&gt;Customer: What do you mean?

&gt;Me: It looks like it got caught in a wood chipper or something. It's pretty beat up.

&gt;Customer: Well, I opened it.

&gt;Me: With what?

&gt;Customer: You guys put way too much tape on it so I had to use a knife.

&gt;Me: How did you use the knife to open it?

&gt;Customer: Why are you wasting my time with these stupid questions? Who cares how I opened the box? What are you going to do for me about this order?

&gt;Me: M'am, how did you open the box? I need an answer.

&gt;Customer (exasperated): I stabbed it with the knife and then cut it open!! Jeez! Can you replace them now or what?

I opened my eyes wide and stared at her like she had 3 heads. Seriously, who does that? She STABBED her package, knowing there was merchandise in it. She literally PLUNGED a large knife into the box and cut it open, cutting the top few tote bags along with the box.

&gt;Customer: What? Why are you looking at me that way?

&gt;Me: We would never send items in this condition to anyone. We have final quality inspections and these just would never have passed. It looks like you damaged the items yourself when you plunged the knife into the box to open it.

&gt;Customer (turning red): WHAT?! That can't be! You guys put like 50,000 layers of tape on it so I needed the knife. 

&gt;Me: Well, if you plunged the knife into the box, obviously whatever is in the box is going to get damaged. This box was filled all the way to the top, after all. You should have just cut slits into the tape and opened it with care.

&gt;Customer: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS! I WANT YOUR MANAGER!

&gt;Me: She will tell you the same thing I am telling you now. We cannot be held responsible for the damage done to the items. You damaged them yourself, so if you want replacements, you will need to place a new order.

&gt;Customer: GET ME YOUR MANAGER NOW!!!

I went and got the manager and explained what had happened. The manager literally started laughing and I couldn't help but follow. The woman became more irate and started cursing at us for making fun of her. Seriously, though- WHO DOES THAT???!!! She stabbed a box full of stuff. What did she expect would happen?

&gt;Manager: M'am, if you were to stab a box of cookies or a bag with a loaf of bread inside, what do you think would happen?

This example must have switched the light bulb in her head to ON, because she immediately turned beet red and simmered down. She apologized, explained she was under a lot of stress and placed a new rush order and promised not to stab the next box of bags.

We are still laughing about this incident here at the office and it has become my favorite customer service moment ever.

UPDATE: For clarification, this woman admitted to using a big ass kitchen knife, not a standard steak knife. She plunged the knife into the box like Michael Myers stabbing a victim. ",TalesFromRetail,684,1513788183

He yells, ""FIRE!"" and I grab the extinguisher almost immediately and rush outside.

Indeed, the area around his gas intake and the nozzle handle itself are both on fire. I spray them down and put it all out. I had figured that since we'd just had the faceplates of our pumps upgraded, maybe it was some kind of wiring incident, but I ask him to see.

talkingtomiranda,"That's not how refunds work, and I have no further help to offer you.","As part of the opening promotions for our new confectionery store, the company gave out roughly 50 bajillion 10% off vouchers. These have to be added to the sale manually, and given we're all new and it's Christmas, sometimes we forget. That's when your friendly neighbourhood ASM (me) gets called over to process a refund and then re-do the transaction with the 10% off applied. Annoying, but whatever.

I somehow lucked out and got Friday night off *and* all day Saturday off. My manager was also away, so our keyholder Emma was in charge over that time. She's worked for the company before in another city, and more than that, she's smart, sassy and has her head screwed on, so the store was in good hands. I skipped off into the sunset* on Friday to enjoy my day off.
*^I ^work ^in ^retail, ^I ^was ^way ^too ^tired ^to ^do ^any ^skipping.

On Sunday I came in to find a note from Emma. Apparently a customer had bought stuff on Friday afternoon, we'd forgotten the discount, and Emma had refunded it back to her card and re-processed it with the 10% off. So far, so what.

On Saturday morning her husband called, wanting to know where the refund was, the money wasn't in their account. Emma explained that it takes some time for the funds to go back to their account, and it had been less than 24 hours since the initial sale, so it would probably take a little longer to go through. She took his number so I could call back if needed. The refund is processing, it's a weekend, it's been less than 48 hours, there's nothing I can do - to be honest I forgot about it. The money will go through after the banks open on Monday anyway, and Emma's dealt with it more compassionately than I would have.

Today (Tuesday) I got another call from the customer's husband (CH).

&gt; CH: My wife bought stuff from you on Friday and we still haven't got our money. I called on Saturday morning about it.

&gt; Me: Oh Emma spoke to me about that, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. The way that refunds work is that we process it in store, but then it's up to the banks to return the money, and it usually takes at least 2-3 business days. Since your wife bought from us on Friday afternoon, only 1 business day has passed, so hopefully it will be back in your account in the next couple of days.

&gt; CH: *long pause, during which I scream internally* That's.... interesting. So my money will be back today?

&gt;Me: *internal screams intensify* I can't promise that; as I say, once we've processed the refund, it's out of our hands since the bank has to reverse the payment. Hopefully it will be soon, but since it's Christmas, I would expect it to take at 2 business days at the very least.

&gt;CH: *another long pause. I reconsider all the choices I have made that have led me to this point in my life.* Are you sure you actually refunded our money?

&gt;Me: *No questioning now; the life choices I have made to bring me here were the wrong ones.* I didn't process the sale, but your wife would have had to present her card and sign for the refund as well as the second purchase.

&gt;CH: No one gave us a receipt for that. *(He's definitely lying. Emma is scrupulous about this.)*

&gt;Me: Okay, if I can get the time and day of the transaction, I'll check that for you.

I get the details and double check, and sure enough, three transactions: initial, refund, and re-purchase.

&gt;Me: The refund has definitely gone through on our end, sir. I'd really suggest waiting a little longer; it's only been 1 business day from the bank's perspective, so I do expect it will be there soon. It takes them time to process refunds at this time of year.

&gt;CH: *grudgingly* There's nothing else you can do?

&gt;Me: *smiling, because I know the frustration will show in my voice if I don't* I'm sorry sir, it's up to the bank. If you haven't received your refund by the end of the week, please let me know and I'll see if there's anything else I can do.

&gt;CH: *grumbles and mutters and is curmudgeonly*

&gt;Me: Merry Christmas! *click*

Side note: when I spoke to the team member who processed the initial sale, the wife never even mentioned having a voucher until the sale had gone through, and *then* said ""where's my discount?"" Yep, one of those.

If you had just said ""I have a voucher"" before you handed over your card NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY. I wish you Christmas presents that require batteries, and no batteries in the house.",TalesFromRetail,891,1513680011

There was no soap, no toilet paper, and it was a mess. We don’t have the keys to open the toilet paper holder or soap, so we just closed the bathroom until she could come in again. Most people just went to the store next door to use their bathroom, but this one woman wasn’t having it.

After our fitting room attendant first told her the bathroom was closed, she decided to go around the store and ask four different people if she could use the bathroom until one of the cashiers, who didn’t know that we had closed it, let her use it.

She took a step inside, then actually came back out to complain to the manager that the bathroom was “unacceptable” and that “somebody needed to attend to it before they let people use it”

The manager explained to her that the reason we kept saying no to her initially was because we didn’t have the means to clean it, but rather than listen she just stormed out to the store next door.

Interestingly enough, in the time it took her to ask everyone if she could use ours, then complain, she could have walked over to the other store and use theirs.",TalesFromRetail,2428,1513622767

Okay, so I work in a grocery store, and today I finally had a story worth telling. Some back story though, as it is a 2 day experience. 

Yesterday I had a customer who wanted to use 3 coupons, which I had no problem with, but they are store specific so I needed to do them after I scanned all the items - so I set them aside to do after the order. 

Well $90 I've forgotten about the coupons until the man brings it up, I panic and ask him to pull out his card but it was too late and it had already gone though. So I do a refund so he can get the coupons, but our system is very outdated so I had to do a refund and then in a seperate transaction scan them all again, and this time with the coupons. 

The guy is visibly losing his patience, which I totally understand because it's been like 8 minutes past at this point, but he was by no means rude to me by my usual standard. 

Anyways, today I was working and the guy from yesterday comes up to me and says ""sorry, but I do believe that I came through your cash register yesterday? With the coupons?"" 
I assumed the worst, and that maybe the refund hadn't gone through or something. But he handed me some chocolate and said ""I'm so sorry, I feel like my temper got out of hand yesterday so I bought these for you.""

wezzer,"No, you messed up, not us.","Okay, 

Let's start with some background info.

I work at a tile store. We supply both tiles and the materials that go with them. If you buy from and have tiles left over once the job is complete we will refund the tiles, but we do not offer refunds on materials as they are perishable goods. This is strictly enforced by our Head Office. There are two signs that state this policy on our desk. If you make a purchase you cannot miss them. There is another sign about 1200x600 large behind the desk and every docket is printed off with this policy written in bold letters. We will also verbally inform you of this policy 9 times out of 10. 

This story begins with my associate he will be A and the customer will be C.

C: Hi, I have a bath area to tile my measurements are 2.6 x 5.

A: Okay, is that imperial or metric?

C: What?

A: Your measurements, are they in feet or in meters?

C: I have no idea... its 260mm by 500mm I think!

A: Oh.. well that's very small. 260mm x 500mm is basically one tile. 

C: Well it's not that! It must be 2600mm x 5000mm!

A: Okay, well going by those measurements it's either one tile, or about 12 meters squared... Is it a very small area? 

C:I don't know!

A: Okay, well do you want to buy the larger amount and if it is over we can refund you for the tiles? 

C: Oh, sure I'll do that then.

A: Okay, and would you like the materials with that?

C: Yes please!

A: Now we can't refund adhesive or grout, is that okay?

C: Yes.

The sale goes ahead, and my associate loads the ladies order into her car.

Forward to the next day - she returns with nearly all the boxes of tiles and her materials. 

C: I had waaaay too many! I'll return them for a refund please.

A: Sure, now we can take back the tiles, but unfortunately I can't refund the adhesive.

C: WHAT!? You never told me that!?

A: Yes ma'am, I did.

C: NO YOU DIDN'T!

A: Yes, I did. Our policy is also displayed on the counter in front of you, and the wall behind me.

C: I WAS DEALING WITH YOU! NOT THE COUNTER!

A: Ma'am, I can refund you for the tiles, but I cannot take back adhesive - I apologize, but it is store policy.

C: YOU WILL GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK! YOU MADE A DOGS DINNER OF THE MEASUREMENTS! THIS IS YOUR FAULT!

A: No, you were unsure of the measurement, you didn't know if it was a small area or a large area.

C: I TOLD YOU IT WAS MILLIMETERS!

A: No! You. Did. Not. Look, I'll contact the manager and see what I can do for you. 

C: This is ridiculous! You muck up my measurements and refuse to refund me!

At this point my associate went into the back office to call the manager and see if he could issue the refund. The customer now speaks to me.

C: This is all his mistake! Pure incompetence.

Me: I heard the entire sale yesterday, you didn't know your own measurements, he explained the policy to you clearly. This is your mistake, not his. 

C: I TOLD HIM MY MEASUREMENTS!

My associate comes back out after speaking with the manager.

A: Okay, we can offer you a refund, however, the amount is over what we are able to give out in cash - so it will be a cheque refund. 

C: A cheque? I want cash!

A: We don't actually have enough cash in store to give to you - the manager specified, it had to be cheque.

C: Well, give me the cheque, but I'm keeping the tiles until it clears!

A: What?

Me: You want us to give you back what you paid... and you want to keep the stock?

C: As collateral! 

Me: No.

A: No way.

C: Then I don't accept the cheque! I have no guarantee that you will keep your word! You (referring to A )- can sign as guarantor and I'll accept.

A: I will not sign anything, ma'am!

C: Then I will be contacting your head office and reporting you!

A: Go ahead, we've offered you a refund and you've refused.

Me: And you want us to give you money and let you keep the stock.

C: I NEVER SAID THAT!

Both myself and A just stared at her as she had clearly just demanded that exact thing.

C left after expressing her distaste for us to a nearby customer - who rolled her eyes at C.

She did return a few days later and accepted the cheque - but not after complaining about our terrible service yet again, to a different associate. ",TalesFromRetail,2121,1513519229
SentientDreamer,"""I have to pick up my granddaughter; she's six years old!""","Okay, got a humdinger for you guys.

So if you may or may not know, I work at Warehou$e Club. It's been about a week or two since I was hired for the seasonal work and I'm a favorite among the supervisors. I have been doing cart-packing most of the time here and usually there's no stress. Except for today.

I'm helping an elderly woman put her items on the cart. I give her the usual spiel: ""Hi, how's it going? I will be assisting you today."" I take a robe and a larger box to put the former onto the latter on the conveyor belt. She immediately reels with ""I don't want my robe on the belt"", and she repeats this while I explain that I'm not putting it on the belt; I'm putting it on the box. She then retorts that I shouldn't put heavy things on the belt at all. I give up at this point and put the two back in the cart as she assures me that she is fine putting her own things on the belt.

Cut to me helping the cashier with the customer before her. This man couldn't have packed his FLATBED with more items. There were like 50-60 items, sorted and stacked (e.g. 10 tubs of sour cream in one box, 6 big cans of veggies of one type on top of 6 of a second type, each in boxes, with a box of 3-3 of both types, very tidy.) For the sake of convenience, most of the items were the same type, so he was focused on speeding things up, and I believed him, but Warehou$e policy states that we had to count items stacked like that individually. I try helping things along by talking with the customer, asking what's the same, and he really did a good job keeping everything sorted. However, the woman behind her was in a rush, and began complaining, much to the disdain of the other customers in line.

""This is nonsense! I've been waiting behind this man for five minutes! This is terrible customer service!"", she complains.

At this point, the supervisors were looking at the cashier and I from the podium (Thank GOD it's right next to our lane), and this customer. We got two supervisors from there to help us speed things further, but it wasn't enough for this cranky old woman (COW).

""I want to see your manager!"" I felt bad for the supervisor she yelled this at, because she was really nice, and she explained that there was nothing we could do about this. Regardless, we had a manager (M) sent up, and as expected, he explained the same thing to her as if it were scripted and he knew what to say by heart.

She did not like it one bit. 

COW: ""You know, I have to pick my granddaughter up in [relatively far away town] in 15 minutes! I've been waiting here forever! You should be moving us up to a newly opened lane if something like this happens!""

M: ""I know, but-""

COW: ""SHE'S SIX YEARS OLD!""

I try to help, but the nice supervisor pulls me away from it, saving me the stress and hassle.

Once she leaves, I hear the manager saying ""I can't win"" with a smile. The supervisors and I joke about being called ""Team Useless"", and I laugh along with them.

Me: ""Sure, I'd love being on Team Useless. That way I can always defy the expectation!""

We carried on with a smile, and I ended up working even faster until it was time for me to move to another department for the shift. Usually days like this go by very well, but I could not forget this moment. I would feel sorry for the cranky old woman, if she didn't choose the only lane that had a guy with a full flatbed there first.

TL;DR: Woman in a rush to get to a far-off town in 15 minutes chose to check out in a lane that had someone with a full flatbed cart first, and complained that it took too long to check out 50-60 items. The manager and a few supervisors got involved. One of the few incidents I actually noticed working for a great and efficient company. You can't please them all, the staff and I joked about it afterwards. ""Team Useless"" rocks!",TalesFromRetail,987,1513306987
C_Sha,"I hope you like dimes, lady","Background. Somewhat small shop. We sell a LOT of different things, including rings, earrings, and so on. We have a LOT of coins, because most people pay with credit cards. So, as the proud cashier that I am, I reserve myself to give change with as many coins as possible when an annoying customer shows up. 

Here is where Lady comes up. She loves earrings, apparently.

&gt; Me: Total is 36,90.  
&gt; L: *gives me a 100*  
&gt; Me: *gives 63,10 as change* 1x 50, 1x 10, 1x 2, 1x 1, and 1 dime.

Pretty good, right? I thought so. 5min later, without leaving, lady then proceeded to buy something else.

&gt; Me: Total is 31,50.  
&gt; L: *gives me another 100*  
&gt; Me: Excuse me. Do you have a 2$ to facilitate change?  
&gt; L: No, I don't.  
&gt; Me, internally: Ooohhh, boy...  
&gt; Me: *gives 68,50 as change* 1x 50, 1x 10, 1x 5, 1x 2, 1x 1, and 1 half dollar.

5min later

&gt; Me: Total is 24,00.  
&gt; L: *gives a 50*  
&gt; Me: Excuse me. Do you have 4$ to facilitate change?  
&gt; L: No, I don't.  
&gt; Me, internally raging: *gives 1x 20, 1x 5, and 1x 1* Quite old bills, btw.  
&gt; Me, internally: Don't you dare do this again.

5min later

&gt; Me: Total is 11,00.  
&gt; L: *gives an old 20*  
&gt; Me: Excuse me, do you have a 2$ or 1$?  
Oh, you wouldn't dare.  
&gt; L: No, I don't.  
Ok lady, it's on.  
&gt; Me: Here's your change.

4 1$ coins, 4 quarters, and 40 dimes.

Few things have given me as much joy as seeing her face after that.  
I could only describe her expression as a shocked ""How could you!""  
She promptly took the change, and left, very annoyed.

&gt; Me: ""Thank you. Have a good day.""

tl;dr: Lady buys stuff, ""forgets"" about any change she got, and turns into a coinstar.",TalesFromRetail,1473,1513255776
KaBar42,YOU CAN'T MAKE ME LEAVE THIS BATHROOM AND I WON'T!,"Alright, so this happened today and unfortunately I didn't get to witness it personally, but I did hear about it after the fact. 

So I'm just doing my thing in my department when I notice, on the other side of the store, the assistant store manager (ASM) escorting a uniformed police officer to the back of the store. 

Well... that's always interesting. So I head over to my team lead and ask him if he has any idea what's going on. He says no, the only radio chatter he heard was the ASM telling customer service to expect a cop and to direct him upstairs. 

Okay. Weird. 

But there's nothing I can do at this point to find out more. We hear some intermittent radio chatter from the other managers about the back men's restroom.

My team lead and I spend a few minutes spitballing what may have happened. I said maybe some idiot left their gun in the bathroom and the store didn't want the liability of having someone else's gun. Or maybe some idiot dropped their drugs in the bathroom. 

 A little while later, we see the ASM, the store manager, two cops and a dude in handcuffs walking down the main aisle. 

Ooh. 

Now, obviously, at this point, all I know is that someone's been arrested. 

The store manager calls out LP to go to a different channel and my team lead and I eavesdrop. We hear this: 

&gt;Store Manager: ""The warrants are good, so they're going to go ahead and arrest him."" 


Ooh. This is getting juicier. 

Another associate closer to the incident came by my department to drop some returns off and we began talking about the incident. She had no idea, but said she'd ask one of the team leads in the department the incident occurred in and check back with me. 

I go to lunch and as I'm getting ready to finish up my lunch and clock back in, the associate I talked to walked in to clock out for the day. I asked her if she had found out anything. 

Apparently here's what happened. 

Someone had noticed the guy walking into the bathroom with product. And anyone who works in retail knows this is a big no-no. No product in the bathrooms! 

I assume it was the store manager who saw it because there was no radio chatter for the lp associates like there normally is. 

The store manager goes into the restroom, hears the sounds of someone opening packages. 

Yurp, he's shoplifting. 

Store manager knocks on the door and informs the guest he needs to leave (we don't really call the cops, we mostly just kick them out). 

The would-be thief refuses to open the door. 

So store manager call the cops, ASM escorts the cops to the bathroom and they remove the guest, somehow. 

They run his name and warrants pop up. 

I swear, shoplifters are the dumbest people out there. This guy could have completely avoided arrest had he just complied with the store manager and left when asked to. 

Instead he barricades himself in the bathroom and the cops have to come and get him. Which results in him being arrested for outstanding warrants. 

Just... really dumb. But it's still no where near as dumb as the one shoplifter who turned a Class A misdemeanor into fucking attempted murder by stabbing the loss prevention associate!

sarahbee_1029,One of the warmest tales I've gotten to tell from working in retail,"When I was working retail right at a year ago, I had an amazing encounter with such a precious customer. This time of year reminds me of the experience I can't wait to share.

One morning on my way to work, I stopped to check the mail to see if a certain package had arrived. It had (yay!). I had ordered what I thought was a small battery powered heater (like the equivalent of a necklace fan thingy, only a heater). Turns out, it wasn't batter powered (dang it!). I was wanting something I could take outside with me to stay warm on smoke breaks and on my walk home. Oh well, so I just decided I'd find someone to give it to at work. 

I was about five steps away from walking through the double doors to the back room to clock in when I was stopped by a customer. She was very soft spoken and very polite, but something about her demeanor made her seem emotionally exhausted. This small lady, probably mid 30's asked me if I could please help her or point her to someone that could. Knowing I could adjust my clock in time later, I said, ""Of course I can! What can I help you with?""

She was looking for a certain brand of blankets that had been on clearance and were in a display bin last week. I worked in the back room at the time and it just so happens I was the one to take the display down the previous day and knew exactly where they were. When I asked how many she needed, she said, ""As many as $20 will buy."" I thanked her for being so generous because I knew there were so many people struggling to stay warm this winter (assuming they were for charity). She smiled at me and I went to retrieve her blankets. 

When I returned, I still had the heater under my arm (not sure why I hadn't stopped and put it in my locker while I was in the back room) and asked if she would mind taking it to donate with the blankets. That's when she burst into tears. She explained that her house had burned down and was living in her friend's shed with her two young children and was just trying to keep them warm until after the weekend when they could find a better place to stay. I immediately knew this was why I had been sent the wrong heater. She didn't want to accept it at first, but then I convinced her that I sincerely wanted her to have it. It was the tiniest gesture. A heater I was just gonna leave laying around. But she was incredibly grateful and gave me the best hug I've ever received from a stranger. We cried together for a minute and then parted ways.

The next week, I got a Christmas card thanking me for being so kind to, ""me and my kids."" No name on it or anything... and then it dawned on me. The heater was still in the box it had been shipped in and had my address on it. I will never forget this woman and how rewarding it was to be able to make a difference. 

Edit: Wow, this story got way more attention than I thought it would. Thank you all so much for your kind words! Sometimes just being a decent human being to someone can create such heart felt response. You never know what people are going through and how far a very simple gesture can go.",TalesFromRetail,680,1513210764
mskashamattel,"""Employees only,"" unless you REALLY need something","I've worked in retail for 6 years, and this is the first time anything like this has happened to me.

I work in a small home decor store. A few days ago, I was in the office getting some paperwork ready for a new hire, when I hear ""Can you help me?"" from behind me in the stock room. That doesn't sound like one of my employees... So I whip around and am confronted with an older woman, standing in the stock room and staring around at the shelves like she's looking for something. I will be Me, older woman will be CR for ""can't read.""

&gt;Me: ""Can I...help you?""

&gt;CR: ""The little girl out front said you had some starfish ornaments back here. I can't find them, I need help. Can't find anything back here.""

&gt;Me: ""Umm, she shouldn't really have told you that because we definitely don't have those. Follow me and I'll show you what she might have meant.""

I've already realized that my poor employee by the door probably said ""back there"" and meant the back of the store, and CR thought that the ""Employees Only"" sign on the door to the stock room was just a suggestion, since clearly ""back there"" means ""I give you permission to have free reign of the stock room."" I take CR out of the stock room and to a section of heavy wall decorations.

&gt;Me: ""These are what she meant, they are wall decorations but since they have a string, you could use them as ornaments if your tree is sturdy enough. But since they aren't ornaments, they aren't part of the sale.""

&gt;CR: *scoffs* ""But my house is all nautical themed. You should have a lot of nautical stuff.""

&gt;Me: ""Unfortunately, our seaside collection was only for our seaside stores, and since we are landlocked here, you had to buy them online.""

&gt;CR: ""But my house is all nautical themed.""

&gt;Me: ""Haha yeah, that's pretty popular these days, I was disappointed that we didn't get anything in like that this year.""

&gt;CR: ""But my house-""

I stare at her for a good ten seconds for a hint on what she wants me to do, realize she wants me to magic some sand and sea from thin air, then proceed to politely inform her that a neighboring store might have some more decorations to fulfill her ""running from the cold to Florida because I'm old"" Christmas fantasies. 

In conclusion, why are you still looking for Christmas decorations halfway through December? Shouldn't that be done already? Why is ""Employees Only"" now a suggestion rather than a rule? Why do all old people love the beach so much?? I'm left with more questions than the poor old woman herself.",TalesFromRetail,1545,1513179720
caffkininigan,You want tropical plants. I have tropical plants. Why are you mad at me?,"Maybe just a rant, I’m new here.

I work in plant nursery. In a tropical climate, important for later.

We give away a free plant if you meet the ts&amp;cs.
The plants available are native to the local area, also important for later.

Customer asks me what plants we have available for free. I ask what she has in mind, because we have a large range. I show her the plants.

She asks me to tell her about everything available. I go through the looong list, decoding the Latin names on the labels for her. 

After a few minutes, she says none of those will do, as her garden is a ‘tropical’ garden.

I politely say something along the lines of ‘some of these plants will fit right in with a tropical style garden. Such and such has glossy leaves, this one might fill in any shady spots you have.’ Spiel, spiel, nicey nicey.

In my head: Lady, these plants are free. Pick one or don’t. You are keeping me away from actual paying customers.

Also its hot. Maybe 102F. We are standing in the sun, humidity is like 1000%, so it feels even hotter. 

She insists that none of the plants will work with her theme and that’s just not good enough. She seems to expect me to have some sort of control over the inventory, or to give her plants that aren’t covered by the scheme. I explain the scheme simply doesn’t work like that.

Eventually she’s worn me down, going on about her ‘tropical’ garden. I can’t actually help her, she’s not actually buying anything. I need to disengage, like yesterday. 

I suggested she wait a little while, the availability changes seasonally, she can always come back another time. She doesn’t want to come back. She’s dissatisfied with our free plants and she doesn’t want to buy any of our other stock. 

I probably had a smidge of snark in my tone when i said “Well, Citywelivein is tropical, so these plants technically are Tropical.”

She starts arguing with me, telling me they aren’t tropical. She seems genuinely upset that I would be so egregiously mistaken. 

I was kind of joking, I knew she was using the word tropical to describe a style, as in Balinese, or Hawaiian, not in the horticultural sense. 

Pretty quickly, though, I realise she has no idea that ‘tropical’ is a really broad climate classification, that it doesn’t just apply to palm trees and hibiscuses. 

(It’s like assuming only cactuses grow in the desert. I’m cool with you thinking that, but don’t tell me I’m wrong, if I suggest other plants live there too. I’m a serious plant nerd, ok.)

In my head:
“Lady, we live in a tropical climate. These plants are native. Therefore. These. Free. Plants. Are. Tropical.”

I can’t take being ‘corrected’ anymore. I tell her I’m being summoned by a coworker and walk away.


TL;DR: Lady who was not buying anything from me, argues with me over insignificant horticultural detail.

thetinybirdie,Customer tries to buy a gift card and use it in the same transaction.,"Okay....so first time poster to tales from retail. Formating is pretty bad. 

So I work in a certain resturant. I work take out so that means I handle most of the gift card transactions. During the holiday season we offer the 10 dollar bonus card for every 50 dollar gift card.
 Okay so this one guy comes in after ordering almost 50 dollars worth of food. Okay that's fine. I seen this guy before, he is generally rude when he completes his transactions. Anyway this guy comes and asks to buy a 50 dollar gift card so he can receive the 10 dollar bonus card. I'm me and he is dude.

Dude.: alright so I want to buy a 50 dollar gift card so i can use that to pay for my food and receive the 10 dollar bonus card. 

Me:  sir, it's not possible the gift card doesn't activate for 24 hours after purchase. (Its actually 4 hours, I just say that so we have no issues with tramsactions). 

Dude: in an angry tone...more than usual.  
""well why Not? And since when"". 

Me. I was working here for 3 years so....longer than that. And you wouldn't be able to purchase a gift card and use it in the same transaction. It's just policy. He gets mad and pays cash for his food.

Lady: ""Your penny cup is getting pretty full.""

Me: ""Huh. Yeah. I guess it is""

Lady: ""Big coins! There aren't any big coins in here"".

Me: ""Uh. No. Look, you know those are for people that are a little short, right?""

Lady: ""Yeah. Bye.""

Me and the guy in line behind her looked at each other like ""OMG. Did that just happen?!"". I'm still a little taken aback. I've seen people abuse the change cup a bit, but nothing like that.

So I ring up her first order, and as she is paying I grab the second order to move it to my end of the counter, not to scan it. This is a habit of mine, get the next order prepped for when its ready.

BonzaSonza,"Trust me, I'm *almost* a doctor","Disclaimer: this anecdote contains blood.

Back when I was a uni student I worked evenings as the shift lead in a DVD rental store (yes, it was a while ago).

One of my favourite co-workers was studying aeronautical engineering, and I was studying a bachelor of medicine/ bachelor of surgery so the rocket science and neuro surgery jokes were plentiful, and it was wonderful to shut down the occasional jerk who treated retail workers like second-class idiots. But I digress. 

We were located in a fairly quiet suburb and open until midnight. It was around 11.30pm on a very quiet rainy evening, and I was sorting shelves and beginning to close when I heard a commotion outside. It was a young couple having a doozey of an argument, and I could hear them coming up the street from a mile away. 

Bored, curious and mentally grabbing popcorn I drift to the front of the store and start adjusting stock there, trying not to be too obvious with my rubbernecking. As I got there I saw the guy turn in frustration and punch his fist straight through the passenger window of a parked car. 

He pulled his arm back and started screaming at the sight of blood spurting from his wrist. His girlfriend was also screaming and standing there, with a shocked expression on her face. 

The guy looks up and down the street, and sees the lights on in our video store, the only place still open, and ran into the store. He was standing at the front counter, hand clamped over his wrist, face as white as a sheet and unable to say anything other than ""aaah, Ah, AAAAAAARGH!"".

I told my offsider to call 000, and while she was on the phone I pulled out a chair, grabbed the first aid kit and tried to administer first aid, but he was having none of it. His girlfriend (GF) was hovering around like an annoying mozzie, blubbering and hanging off his good arm.

Guy: you're just a video store person, what do you know?

GF: Oh my God baby I'm so sorry, please don't die baby please!

Me: I'm a registered first aid officer, and I can apply a bandage to your wrist to slow the bleeding until the ambulance officers arrive. 

GF: Stay with me baby! Baby don't go!!

Guy: Aaargh, I'm dying! Please help me!!! 

GF: I'll never do it again, I promise! I love you

Guy: I love you too. I'm sorry, I thought that...

At this stage it's clear to me that they're both drunk, this guy has an injury of unknown severity, but he's bleeding all over my counter so I want a look at it, and they're too involved in apologising to each other to pay any attention to me.

Me: (yelling) Quiet! 

Two shocked faces look at me. I pull out my first aid and med student ID cards, hand them to the guy and say:

""Trust me, I'm ALMOST a doctor.""

The guy started to laugh weakly, and handed over his wrist. The girlfriend is still sobbing behind him, begging him not to due and leave her. I quickly bandaged him up, satisfied that it was a superficial injury only and nothing life-threatening and had him sit to wait for the ambulance officers to arrive. 

It wasn't so fun mopping up the blood afterwards, but two days later I arrived at work to find an enormous bunch of yellow roses for me with a card that read ""thanks for saving my life""

shezka_foxe,"No, it Won't Play that Game....","So, I work part-time at a game store. I don't get a lot of people who leave me stressed and tired from work, but one of these times a lady came in who just refused to listen to anything me or may manager said. 

Since it's the holiday season we've had a lot of people coming in buying gifts. We had one mom come in and she was asking me questions about our DS systems. I had previously been recommending our 2DS systems to a few customers since they were cheaper and we had a couple that came pre-installed with a game brand new. 

Lady: Can my son play pokemon on this? -points at a 3DS-

Me: Yes, it does! What pokemon game did your son want to play on it?

Lady: -confidently- Emerald!

Me: -pauses- On the 3DS? 

Lady: -still confident- No, the one on the gameboy advance! Thats' the one he wants to play!

Joe (my manager): -overhears the conversation and comes over- Ma'am, you can't play gameboy games on the 3DS. You can only do that with the original DS or the DSlite. 

Lady: -looks at us like were stupid- No, a guy at (other location) told me my son could play emerald on that one! -points to 3DS-

Joe: He was mistaken, you can't. 

This went back and forth for about 2-5 minutes. My manager even showed her on the back of the 3DS how there was no place for the cartridge to go in and we told her we did have the DSlite in stock so her son could play DS games and gameboy advance games. We didn't have any gameboy advance games in stock either (I don't even think we sell them anymore) and told her she would have to buy it online from another retailer. 

She wouldn't believe us and kept insisting she could. Eventually she just glared at us and left, with me glancing at my manager and shrugging. I haven't seen her since then. 

Side Story: Had a gentleman about two weeks ago who kept asking me about our VR system for the playstation. I told him I was unfamiliar with the VR equipment since 1) I'd never played with it 2) I couldn't recommend any games since I hadn't played any of them. 

I told this guy multiple times Joe had not only owned the system, but several games on it and he would be the best person to answer his questions. This guy kept asking me questions and getting frustrated I couldn't answer them, despite the fact Joe was only a few paces away and available to talk.

GoldMidnight,I Can't Believe You Need to See My ID For My Military Discount!,"So, this happened a few weeks ago at $Home Improvement store, while I was cashiering on one of the front end registers. My store offers military discounts, but like most places, you have to show some form of military ID. Most people are pretty understanding about this. However, occasionally one of us cashiers will get yelled at by a ""veteran"" who thinks that his word alone should be enough for his 10% discount.

I started ringing up a guy who resembled a pale string bean (we'll do SB for him). His stuff was pretty generic items, I believe. He was pretty rude throughout the whole order, ordering me around, not using those magic words that they teach everyone in Kindergarten, etc. And then he brought out this charmer:

&gt;SB: ""And I want my military discount.""

&gt;Me: ""Awesome! Can I see some ID?""

&gt;SB: ""Why should I show you my ID?""

&gt;Me: ""So I can apply your military discount...? We have to see some form of military ID.""

He immediately began grumbling about how stupid and ridiculous this was, and how he shouldn't have to show his ID, just because he'd left it in his car.

I was about to crack and just tell him that I'd do a 10% discount for him, just to get him out because he was rubbing my nerves raw, when he looked out the door (it was pouring down rain, which was no big surprise because this is the Pacific Northwest), grumbled some more about _what an inconvenience_ this was, said he'd just grab his ID, and headed out the door. He returned maybe a minute later with his ID. I didn't even have time for another customer to come up.

&gt;SB: ""See? Are you happy, now that you've made me run _all_ the way across the parking lot in the rain just so you could give me my discount?!""

&gt;Me: ""Ecstatic. Your total is $XX.xx.""

What I thought was funny is that our parking lot is huge. This guy was older and didn't look very fast, so there was no way he was going to be able to get all the way across the parking lot and back in about a minute.

TL;DR: Guy leaves military ID in his car, but wants his military discount. Throws a fit when I decide to follow company policy by insisting on seeing his ID.

char_kelly94,She wouldn’t leave,"My mom has always been a workaholic. She has owned a small fashion boutique for about 30 years. i have become interested in taking it over some day so i’ve been working a long side of her since i was a little girl. 

Now that it’s the holiday season we are open 10 hours a day; 7 days a week. We don’t have much of a staff because she owns two businesses and doesn’t have the money for that many people. So obviously her and i are exhausted. 

Yesterday a lady comes into the store at 8 right when we close. We were finishing up with a customer and wrapping her last two gifts so we let the lady come in and look for 10 minutes. By 8:15 my mom goes up to her and asks her if she needs help with anything and that we are getting ready to close up and our hours are 10-8 tomorrow. The lady just says “no im still looking.” So my mom walks away from her. By that time i started shutting all our lights off upstairs and in the back while the lady was still looking in the front of the store. Obviously she knew we wanted to get out of there. By 8:20ish i go up to her and ask her if i can take her stuff to the front and if she’s ready to check out as we are getting getting to close. She just says “no.”

So by this time i am fuming. My poor mom is working every single day. i catch her crying because of how tired and stressed she is. i will say it’s my moms fault too. She is a pushover when it comes to customers and she always wants to make them happy. 

Finally the lady is at the register but she isn’t ready to check out yet... she’s asking my mom questions about jewelry brands and trying jewelry on. By this time it’s 8:35. (Yep my eye was watching the clock the entire time) i go up to the lady and say “i have you all totaled up. You’re ready to check out right?” And the lady just says “no.” My Mom then goes to me “i know you’re so tired and over worked but we’ll be home soon” i then say in front of the lady “yeah it would be nice to be home right now. i don’t understand why we aren’t.” And the lady completely ignores me again and asks my mom another question. 

i was so close to losing it. i was visibly upset in front of this lady but no the world revolves around her. My mom told me to leave and that she would have my dad pick her up. i had to get out of there because i was so close to freaking the fuck out and i know my mom would kill me.

My mom tells me today that the lady stayed until 9. My mom finally said to her “i need to get home.” And the lady again ignored her and kept looking so my mom said “I have you all totaled up. I need to get home. im exhausted.” The lady still fucking ignores her (sorry for the cursing but im still livid) So my mom says “i will call the cops if you do not get out of my store right now.” Finally the lady walks out...

I know this is partially my moms fault for being a push over and not taking action faster but she is scared of bad online reviews and we live in a small town so she’s scared of bad mouthing as well.

im so sick of customers who don’t realize that the world doesn’t revolve around them. We have lives too. We have certain hours that we are open for the public and that should be respected. 

Sorry for my poor writing. im just waking up and needed to vent. Off to another 10 hour day : )

Sfrodo,"""Yes sir, I expect you to pay the full amount.""","I worked for many years at a second hand baby clothing store. I was the only male employee, and for the most part I genuinely enjoyed my job. However, there were times where I was ready to jump the counter. 


Cut to an average day when all of a sudden a massive truck pulls into the parking lot and out steps a husband and wife. This guy is absolutely massive, military type and his wife is sporting the ""can I speak to a manager haircut"". 


I really try not to judge a book by the cover, especially since I am a man working at a baby clothing store but lets just say [This starter pack](http://i.imgur.com/Amywm2c.png) sums him up perfectly. 


So they shop for about an hour and come up to my cash register. I begin checking them out and so far there are no issues at all. Neither of the patrons are very pleasant, but nothing I can't deal with. 

Me: your total comes to $32.40 

Him: *Slaps $32 on the counter* 

I pick up the $32 and we begin what is the most awkward stare down in the history of the world. I look at him, He looks at me, I look at his wife, his wife looks at me, He looks at his wife, the wife looks at him, I look deep inside myself contemplating if I will drive my car into a tree on the way home. 

Me: It was $32.40....

Him: Yes....

Me: You gave me $32.....

Him: Yes......

Me: It was $32.40 I need the 40 cents. 

Him: I gave you $32.

Me: Yes I understand but the total is $32.40. 

Him: I don't have it. 

Me: I'm going to need the 40 cents man. 

Him: REALLY! You expect me to walk ALLLL the way back to my TRUCK and get you 40 cents. 

Me: Yes. 

He walks out and get the change. When he comes back in he literally throws the change across the counter. Pulls an electric cigarette from his pocket (Vape) proceeds to take a massive hit and blow it right in my face.

i_love_nny,Ma'am we're closed please leave!,"Not only am I on mobile I also voice to text this entire post so please excuse any typos


I work at a grocery store we're generally speaking we don't ask customers to leave after we close just let them finish their shopping and come up when they come up. That said there's a lady who at one point stayed 45 minutes after our closing time. Now the thing is she had been doing this incrementally for a couple weeks she would stay 5 minutes then 10 25 and finally she settled in at 45.

Usually when someone stay that late they're in their own little world and it would finally dawn on them they were the only person in the store not this lady she knew what she was doing.

She knew we wouldn't kick anyone out so she just kept shopping and stopping and trying to chit chat with the employee's while we were trying to close the store around her. It finally got to the point where employees were posting up at the end of each aisle and would ask her 

""are you finding everything alright are you finding everything alright is there something we can help you find""

Finally in the only instance in my 10 years of working at this store the manager asked the woman to leave said please pay for your items and go we are trying to close the store at which point she looked at her watch and said oh my is that the time?

After all that she had the audacity to ask if anyone would be able to help her out to her car she basically bought two loaves of bread a bag of chips and a carton of eggs there really was no reason for her to ask for a carry out except for she wanted to ring every last drop of customer service out of us",TalesFromRetail,1815,1512574840
Adamsandlersshorts,“I want my hanger I’m calling corporate”,"I work at a retail store. We have two ***Very clearly indicated*** lines. One for returns one for purchases.  

I’m the only cashier who can take returns. It’s a stupid system, but what can I do I don’t make the rules I just work there. I’m basically a customer service desk and a cashier.  

Well it’s super busy all day long. Purchase line is outstandingly full, and only one person has a return. I take two purchases and then I call the return over because that’s what I was trained to do. It’s easier to clear a purchase line than it is to clear a return line since we have multiple cashiers. But also keep it as fair as possible by not letting the return instantly come to the register while all of those purchases wait.  Make it look like I care at all. 



Well anyways, I had taken three purchases so it was the returns turn next. I clearly stated and pointed “I can help your return next” 

This lady from the purchase line shoves her way past the return person and starts putting her stuff on the counter. 

“I called the return next ma’am” 

“I don’t care you’re taking me next”

Umm no I’m not. But since she wants to be petty and block the whole register and pout about it, I just made the return come around the other side to my register opening and hand me
Her items.  

As you can imagine, the purchase lady was boiling.  

Well I finally got to the purchase next. 

I start scanning her items. We reuse our clothing hangers so I take the hanger off and put it away. 

“Give me my hanger back” 

“We reuse our hangers I’m not allowed to give them out”

She was with her husband so he chimes in as well. “Dude its a f-ing hanger just give it to her” 

I replied with “so when you get hired somewhere and they give you a set of rules, you just say screw it and do whatever you want?”

They didn’t respond to that. They just said give me a manager. 

So my manager comes over. The woman immediately starts with “this cashier was extremely rude to us. First he just shoved us out of the way to do a return and now he’s cuckolding the hangers” 

Manager says “we don’t give our hangers out ma’am” 

“I have a ton of your hangers in my closet and now he’s holding onto them like they’re his first born child???” 

I reply with “I’ve worked here for three years and the rules have always been the same.” 

“You guys are f-ing insane I’m never shopping here again. Give me corporates number and write you and your managers name down”

And then she finished it off by shoving her middle finger right in my face and calling me the C word. 

My other manager was watching over the security cameras the entire time it happened and she was cracking up over our Walkie talkies so I had to sit there and try not to laugh. 


*any time I try to post something here and it has swearing dialogue it gets caught by the spam filter.  So I censored it*

Also, just to note, if I wanted to I could’ve given her the hanger it’s no big deal. We reuse our hangers but no one is going to fire me if I give away one occasionally. But she was rude so she’s not getting any special treatment.  ",TalesFromRetail,2396,1512502304

As I predicted, there was fallout today, but not until toward the end of the day. I was actually feeling pretty relaxed by lunchtime, when I felt the greatest threat had passed. At about 3 o'clock, though, I got called up to the service desk where Hey Lady was standing with her arms crossed and her eyebrow raised, looking like she was about to win something. Standing next to her was...

Oh, dear god, no.

It was Tony. The most spineless assistant manager ever to assistant manage. This guy once gave a dude a free $800 TV and assembled it for him because the guy said he dropped the first one he bought. There is literally no tuchus that Tony won't kiss.

&gt;**Tony:** ""thisisaflawedprocess, did you help this woman yesterday?""

&gt;**Me:** ""I believe we spoke briefly as I was leaving.""

&gt;**Tony:** ""She said you behaved very rudely and refused to give her your name.""

&gt;**Me:** ""I'll admit to walking away from her because she was very hostile, and like I said, I was leaving, so I was under no obligation to speak to her, let alone give her my name.""

&gt;**Hey Lady:** ""OK, I'm going to jump in here because I would hate for you to 'forget'"" *with finger quotes* ""some of the details. I was standing in that line for 45 minutes. I am so sick of coming into this store, waiting in huge lines, and watching other employees standing around. Every time it's like this! So I stopped her as she coming out of the back room."" *Turns to face me* ""Now, honey, you can pretend not to see a line full of people but you aren't going to pretend to not see me. I am not the one. I am 57 years old and I do not have time for games.""

I am so done with this wretched crow. My first instinct is to tell her that I smelled Natty Ice and Bengay before I saw her, but I keep it under the lid. I'm not even going to reply to her directly.

&gt;**Me:** ""Tony, I was off the clock when she approached me. She was extremely rude and confrontational. I walked away. I do not apologize.""

&gt;**HL:** ""Oh, sweetie. You don't even know rude yet. So,"" *to Tony*, ""What happens now?""

&gt;**Tony:** ""What do you mean?""

&gt;**Tony:** ""I will discuss improving customer service with thisisaflawedprocess. We will make sure this never happens again.""

&gt;**HL:** ""Fine. I don't know how you train your people but if this is what they do, you might want to retrain the trainers. Eventually they're gonna run into people who aren't going to put up with their s---.""

And she left. Yes, I had to do additional customer service training, and yes, I received a verbal reprimand and was reminded to try de-escalation in the future.

ArtisticWonder,"""How can someone so rude work in retail?""","The usual long time lurker, first time poster, sorry for formatting etc.  

A little backstory: Last year I was unfortunately assaulted by 5 guys who used a bicycle chain to smash my head into the pavement (Really bad concussion that lead to me having to leave school for a year), and therefor I sometimes have trouble with speaking and understanding people when I'm stressed. I work at a pretty big and common grocery store in my country.  

So, it was one of those days with a loooong shift (8AM-8PM) and I was around 8 hours into the shift. A relatively young lady (Around 45-50-ish) comes up to the counter where I'm stationed, and starts yelling at me (She'll be AC for Angry Customer, and I will be Me).  

&gt;AC: I bought a cheese here 2 weeks ago, and when I needed to serve it to my guests, it had already gone bad!  

&gt;Me: I'm so sorry about that! Do you want a refund?  

(She's completely overheard, or ignored me)  

&gt;AC: So? What are you gonna do about it?!?!  

&gt;Me: Pardon me, you probably didn't hear what i-  

&gt;AC: How can someone so rude work in retail? You never said  anything! You just stared at me like I'm some sort of lunatic!  

&gt;Me: (Trying to keep my head straight and calm down since I'm now panicking): I wasn't trying to-  

&gt;AC: where's the manager? I want to speak to a manager!  

&gt;Me: I'm the manager this evening...  

&gt;AC: Well you're horrible at your job, and I'll definitely write to your boss and get you fired for this!  

&gt;Me: I'm terribly sorry about this ma'am, can I get you a refund?  

&gt;AC: YES I WANT A REFUND!  

(AC slams the receipt on the desk)  

&gt;Me: I see the cheese was on sale - Why if you mind me asking?  

&gt;AC: Because the use-by date was the next day.  

This angry customer is fuming and yelling at me because of a cheese that went bad 2 weeks after the use-by date!  

&gt;Me: Okay, I'll just need a signature right here, and you'll get-  

&gt;AC: Signature? I'm not giving you anything! I don't want a refund anyway!  

Then she storms off yelling and cursing that this has been the worst customer service in history...
Now 10 minutes later, and I'm still shaken up about this lady, and she comes back into the store, goes over to my desk in the middle of me serving a customer - Then she just slaps me in the face, and says it's not personal, she's just angry at the store. Well, it kinda felt personal.  

I'd have to say she's probably one of, if not, the rudest customer I've ever experienced...    

TL:DR Angry lady slaps and cusses me out because of a cheese that went bad, and didn't even want a refund.  

EDIT: The cops were contacted, and at the moment the only repercussion she's had, is she's banned from all of our stores. Hopefully I'll be able to take this further so she doesn't get away with it.",TalesFromRetail,676,1512409179
BazBailey,This IPod is broken because I can't remember my password,"Okay so this is my first time post, it's a fair few months ago so not word for word but the general gist of it is here.

Sorry for format, I'm on mobile!

I work at a second hand gaming store in the UK. Because we are second hand, we have different rights to other stores. If a customer buys an item they don't like (not that it's faulty) they have 48 hours to bring it back. It doesn't have to be unopened or anything like that but it's only to refund back onto a voucher to spend in store.
(If it's faulty they get cash back and they have a 2 year warranty)
 
So a guy came (C=customer, M = me) into work. 

C: This iPod is broken! I want my money back.
M: So sorry about that, can I see the receipt please?

(He throws it on the counter. I look and it's a few days old.

I go to load up the iPod to see what wrong with it, whilst asking him what the problem is.)

C: I can't get into it at all!
 
(I'm confused because it's turning on fine, but then i am met with an unlock pin. )

M: Can you put your pin in please?
C: I don't know the pin, that's the problem!
 
(Bearing in mind we are a small store and are not allowed to take in, let alone sell any goods in the first place without it being wiped and the password taken off.)

M: Wait, so you were sold this iPod with a password on it?
C: no, I put the password in when I first bought it and then I forgot it.

M: We can't do anything if you've forgotten your password, sir, you'll have to go to Apple and they'll sort it out for you.
C: you sold me an ipod, and I can't use it, you need to give me the money back!

M: but the password wasn't on it when we sold it. If we refund this ipod now we wouldn't be able to sell it on again or even fix it, only you know the password.
C: it's broken, give me my money back now!

M: sir, it isn't broken, it's just locked by a password. If you bring it to Apple with proof of purchase they should help you out but there's nothing we can do.
C: But I can't remember the password! So I can't use it so you should refund me, I don't want it anymore.

M: we can't even do a 48 hour refund anymore sir because it is out of the allocated time period and due to the fact it has a password which we can't remove we wouldn't be able to take it in anyway. If you go to Apple they should help-
C (shouting): it's your fault I can't get into it! You sold me it! 

This goes on for about 20 minutes, of him just saying the same things followed by me telling him the same solution.

 Not the worst by far on here but entirely frustrating.

Tl;dr: Man puts password on his iPod, can't remember it so claims it's broken and asks for a refund about 20000 times.

thisisaflawedprocess,"""Be quiet. Shut your mouth and listen.""","So I recently reentered the world of retail after an unfortunately brief escape. Back at the same store, same department I was in before I left. Anyway, I just finished a shift and I'm leaving the back room, which unfortunately leads straight into the layaway department. No sooner do I walk past the queue of people (wearing a winter coat and holding my keys) than I hear a loud, outraged ""Hey!""

I look around, wondering if I didn't hit someone with the double-swinging door. Nope. I see a woman staring daggers at me from the middle of the queue.

&gt;**Hey Lady:** ""Do you not see what's happening here?""
 
Now I'm really confused, because I honestly don't.  There are two registers, both of which have very experienced associates running them. The line, while long, is moving. 

&gt;**Me:** ""What's going on?""

&gt;**HL:** *Eyes widening incredulously* ""There are customers who need *help* is what's going on! I've been in this line for 45 minutes and it hasn't moved! I don't know if they train you guys to be slow on purpose or what but some of us have s--- to do!""

&gt;**Me:** ""Uh ... OK. Well, these ladies at the registers are doing their best, so hopefully the wait won't be much...""

At this point, this woman walks over to me and puts her finger in my face, just like that picture of Jamie Lee Curtis.

&gt;**HL:** ""Be quiet. Shut your mouth and listen. I am telling you what is happening, not asking for your feedback. *Every time* I'm in this store I have to wait and *every time* I'm told to just deal with it. I work in customer service so I know the customer isn't always right, but this time the customer is me and I *am* right. Now I told you I've been waiting for 45 minutes. The next words out of your mouth had better be a solution, not an excuse.""

She then stares expectantly at me. I must confess that at this point I was totally speechless. I literally just turned around and walked away. A - I'm not allowed to help off the clock, and as I said, I was very obviously not working, and B - I have a bit of a clapback problem, which has gotten me into trouble before. I desperately wanted to read this gnarled tree root of a woman for filth, but I knew I had to bite my tongue.

The last thing I heard when I walked away was the layaway associate telling HL that she didn't know my name, which she totally does. I have no doubt I'll hear more about this tomorrow, but for now I'm just glad to be out of there.",TalesFromRetail,2179,1512351609
HowToEatBurgers,Gentleman tried to change his console bundle 2 months after he had purchased his console,"Ovbiously as many people do in a first time poster and sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile.

This isn't as bad as a lot of the stories I've read on here but it was a first for me.

So I work in one of the biggest video game stores in the UK (Yes that one). We have been known to have pretty decent if not great console deals for our Black Fridays. Now the main bundle we shall be talking about is for the PS4 Pro, now normally the console goes for £350 by its self or with destiny 2 or Fifa, for the black Friday sales it was on offer for £299.99 with Fifa &amp; Call of duty. 
So it was a typical Saturday and the store I work is was incredibly busy everything was going perfectly well until he showed up 

(Asshat will be AH, Me ovbiously is me)

&gt; Me: Hey next customer please
&gt; AH: Hi there me, I just saw your offer on the PS4 Pro, I had bought my console and was wondering if I could refund it for that particular bundle
&gt; Me: That shouldn't be any issue, as long as it's within our 28 day return window and unopened 

So the customer proceeds to hand me his receipt and right off the bat I notice two things. 1) The item was open and you could clearly tell if was used and 2) the console was purchased 2 months ago and so clearly is out of our return policy.

&gt; Me: I'm sorry to tell you sir but I'm afraid I cannot do the refund due to the console being opened (and had pretty bad signs of being used) and the fact that it was purchased 2 months ago
&gt; AH: What the fuck do you mean I cannot refund it, how dare you tell me I cannot get my money back.

This was the proceeded with 2-3 minuets of more harassment towards me for being a scummy person. 
This was then followed by one of the most craziest things I had witnessed in my store.
The gentleman had asked me if the console was faulty if he could get a refund, I then told him that if there was a technical fault we would be able to replace it for him (keep in mind I mentioned the word technical fault).
He then leaves the store and returns an hour later wanting to see me... 

&gt; AH: I want a refund

He shows me his console and I swear this guy must have taken a hammer to his PS4 because the entire casing was broken and the cabling was popping out.
I tell him again that the the 1 Year guarantee with the manufacture only covered technical fault, he then proceeded to look at me as if I had killed his puppy. He demanded that I pay for his new console as I forced him to break his PS4 (honestly wish I was joking)
He was then banned from the store for verbal harassment.

TLDR: Guy attempts to refund his PS4 2 months after buying his and has a tantrum when he cant.

&gt;ER: Oh cool! Well then yeah this one would definitely work! I can get you over at my till if this is all you're getting, and could help you transfer them if you need assistance.

&gt;OM: Ok sure! That would be super helpful!

Now I ring him up and things go normally, no customer melt downs, anger over the price, nothing whatsoever. I then began the process to download the app, hook up the flash drive and get ready to transfer things over for him. Then **it** happened.

&gt;OM: Ok, that sounds great! *smile* *smile*

&gt;ER: Ok sir, I'll just confirm the prompt that allows the device to access your photos and --- ...

Suddenly, without the mental preparation required to sufficiently survive this without mental scarring I am suddenly exposed nearly thirty nude photos detailing the various viewing angles of a 65 year old man's private parts.

&gt;OM noticing my expression: Oh, I didn't mean to scare you! It's just I need those developed because they're a christmas gift for my wife! Those are the only ones you need to transfer! I'm so sorry, this is so awkward!

&gt;ER not knowing what to say: It's okay.... almost everyone has nudes on their phone.... I'll just finish this up as quick as possible.

And then we sat in silence as I awkwardly got way too familiar with this old man's private parts. I feel incredibly sorry for whoever he goes to to have these developed. I hope dearly that the person does not need to see the photos in the process.

adventurehunter9876,We're already getting fired lady!,"Hi there, bit of a lurker, first time poster. Mobile too, so apologies ahead of time. This post is about something from today. Here goes!

So I'm in retail, a big box store. Recently my store was selected for closing. As such, there were some changes. No layaways was one of these changes. All contracts would be honored, but we could no longer start new ones.

Just a couple days ago, the store got their permit to use the words ""store closing"" and ""all sales are final"" in ads and posters. Of course, we all know how challenged customers can be bothered to read. Before I started working, or reading this sub, I did not know how ignorant of surroundings customers could be. 

With the all sales are final approach, our systems got an update to no longer allow the refund option. It's not just policy, it's literally not in our systems anymore. Receipts don't even print with barcodes anymore. For layaway though, we are allowed to take individual items off, or cancel the contract and do refunds. However, and we warn customers now, each and every time, we can not do refunds for layaway AFTER we process your final payment. 

Enter lady from hell. She seemed mild at first. I was working layaway today, and as such I was the one to bear the brunt later. But as we pulled up her info, I told her what is described in my post- no refunds after I process payment, so if that's what you want (a lot of people have been cancelling layaways lately to then get the stuff at the liquidation prices, but that's another story), we have to do that NOW. She says no.

I reiterate, because she had said something about wanting the lower prices, that we have to do that before she pays. She huffs at me, tells me she has places to be, etc. No time for this basically. I get that, it's that season. By all means. 

I process her payment, and retrieve her items. As I'm stamping her receipt ""all sales are final"" she asks me to put it on top so that she won't lose it when she goes to customer service and refunds her items. Loose conversation follows, me as me, AL is angry lady

Me- ""Ma'am, there are no refunds. I told you this before I put your payment through.""

AL- ""this is fucking ridiculous! I bought these before you were closing!""

Me- ""Yes, ma'am, but the payment was after. I told you if you wantes to return it, I needed to do it before you paid. I even asked a second time"" 

AL- ""I don't fucking care. I want the lower prices. Give me my money back!""

By this point I'm just exhausted. It's Saturday, first weekend of the month, closing store stress, and I'm just a retail worker making a quarter more than minimum wage. 

Me-""ma'am, I told you twice, we can't do refunds. Our system will just not allow it. Period.""

AL-""get me a manager now!"" She starts storming off towards customer service almost foaming at the mouth. Maybe a bit of creative license on my part, but oh well. I call up to the desk to let them know that an angry tornado is coming their way, and they let the manager know over the radios. 

It's gonna be like a trainwreck, so of course I have to follow to go watch. My manager isn't the type to throw people under the bus, and isn't staying with the company either, so she's been pretty awesome. Especially in this trying time of a store closing. 

Back to the customer. She's yelling her head off at the desk, demanding her money back. Service desk lady simply tries to get a word in that there's nothing we can do. I wish I could give a better description, but there's just no recounting the vitriol the woman is spouting off. 

Manager comes up and stays beside me. She gets some overflow, but I'm getting most of the heat in terms of f bombs dropped. When AL finally runs out of breath, an impressive amount btw, kudos to you lady, manager just says ""Sorry, we can't do refunds. Adventurehunter told you two times of when we could do refunds. It's just out of our hands now.""

You'd think she'd insulted AL's dead mother's soul or something. New hate just comes out. The kicker? It was a hundred bucks in the layaway contract at most. And YOU WERE WARNED LADY OMG

So the we get to the part where this lady is promising to get us fired, the ground of the store salted, ancestors purged from existence, yada yada yada. Finally, a fellow associate speaks up. A sweet lady who's held her job longer than I've been alive, just yells ""We're already getting fired in a month or so. Get the hell out!"" 

Manager tells the lady that security has called the police and to just leave before they get here. Storms out with her shopping cart. I get an extra fifteen for my break and go watch college football. Thank God I have the next two days off. Crazies everywhere smh

tcookie88,Parents should accompany their kids when ordering food,"First time posting to this sub and know that I know this exists, it will be my home.

One morning at my bulk store while i was helping customers, a kid about 9 comes up with a 20 dollar bill and orders 2 bags of chips that together cost $1.78. He hands me the 20 and as I'm gathering his change, he walks away. I try to call him back but he keeps walking and it seems he doesn't hear me. I see him walk to his mom, who's in line to pay for the other items she got from the rest of the store. They're too far to hear me call after them and I couldn't leave the other people I was serving so I set his change and receipt under the register because I thought ""his mom would make him come back and if not I'll catch them before they leave"" (my section was right next to the exit). 10 minutes later I was right, he comes back and I give him his change and receipt. 15 minutes after that, my manager pulls me away and tells me that woman complained that I refused to give her son his change and told her son that he doesn't get any change. I explained my side but my managers have to review the security tapes anyway. They see I was telling the truth. Next day the woman comes back threatening to sue but we offer to show her the tapes to prove her son left his change and at that point she drops her accusation and leaves.

Moral of the story: please stay with your child when ordering items.",TalesFromRetail,2564,1512261055
SerasDragon,Sometimes kids are the best customers :),"So it was a pretty non stop day at Game Store and with only two of us on we were all over. A lovely older lady comes in asking about a present for her grandson. She knows nothing except he likes the tins of pokemon cards.

Ok good start, she says she can text her daughter to send through pics of the ones he already has, so far so good! I pull out the three tins we have and she inevitably asks me which one is best.

I've played all the games and know all the names but I never got into the TCG (I was a Yugioh kid) so I know nothing about the cards and I have a line forming. Cue this kid (9-10~) bouncing up enthusiastically.

&gt;Kid: You're buying pokemon cards for someone! I love pokemon cards :D

&gt;L: Oh that's lovely!

&gt;Kid: *Pull out a small tin he has on him and starts showing her his favourites*

&gt;L: *Seeing and understanding that I have other customers to serve, shows this helpful little guy the tins* Well maybe you could help me decide which one to get!

So I leave them with the tins and a great big thank you and cull the line a bit before checking back in with them.

The kid has helped her decide on which one he thinks her grandson will like so I put the other two away and she jumps into the line. He even gave her a couple free card sleeves because he didn't need them anymore and wanted them to go to a good home!

The kid came up later in line so I gave him a huge thank you and a big smile for helping out. He just seemed happy to have someone to show off his pokemon card skillz to :P

The bad stories tend to be more compelling, but especially with so many kids being at the very least a bit uhhh, untidy, it's always great to see the ones that are just little bundles of joy and helpfulness.

wezzer,You should just KILL YOURSELF!,"This is probably my most shameful story.

(This happened over 4 years ago so the conversation isn't word for word - but you'll get the idea.)

I had just started working in a tile store, I was about 2 weeks on the job.

One evening a woman came in after close and purchased tiles - part of the order was mosaic tiles which she brought to the counter. 

I put through her order and she collected a few days later.

A few mornings after this lady had been and gone the telephone rang and I answered politely. It was the lady from several nights before and she was NOT happy.

Lady:Hello, I'd like to speak to wezzer.

Me: That's me, what can I do for you?

Lady: YOU GAVE ME THE WRONG MOSAICS!

I was immediately stunned by this woman shouting down the phone at me. She went from 0 to 90 real quick.

Me: I'm sorry, what mosaics?

Lady: The ones I bought the other night! I brought them to the counter and you still fucked it up! Do you even wake up in the morning?

Me: Uh.. yes I do.. what mosaic did you receive?

She describes the exact mosaic she brought to the counter - an important fact to note is that this lady was in so long after close that the lights had been dimmed and so she had mistaken the color of the mosaics she bought. Once she took them home and saw them in proper lighting she didn't recognize them.

Me: Okay, looking at your docket I can see that is the mosaic you-

Lady: NO IT IS NOT! I NEVER EVEN LOOKED AT THIS MOSAIC! ARE YOU STUPID?

Me: Ma'am if you're unhappy with the mosaic, I apologize and we'd be happy to swap them for you.

Lady: You are so useless! How did you even get a job? If I were your manager you would be fired! You shouldn't even bother getting out of bed in the morning!

I was so shocked at this woman's tirade that I just stammered out another apology - I was shaking from head to toe and I was furious... but being new to the job I didn't want to act aggressively towards a customer so I just apologized over and over again until finally-

Lady: I DON'T CARE THAT YOU'RE SORRY, YOU SHOULD JUST KILL YOURSELF YOU USELESS IDIOT!

After that she hung up. 

One of my biggest regrets is not standing up for myself to that woman. I'll probably always remember that phone call but now I take no crap from any customers because of it. So, I guess it helped me in a way.",TalesFromRetail,790,1512146194

Unapologetic_Canuck,See? These are the light bulbs I wanted!...,"So a few years ago I was working night shift as a floor cleaner for a national department store chain. Pretty easy work, not much to write home about but it pays the bills. My main duties involved using a floor scrubber to clean as much of the floor as I can in a night. Been doing it for years at this point so it's basically second nature to me.

This occurred in December, as we approached Christmas. Normally, this store opens and closes every day, as per usual. But during December, they opted to stay open 24 hours to let shoppers be shoppers. Yay. Now, normally we don't have to watch out for much, except for the occasional employee that isn't paying attention and almost gets creamed by my machine. With the store open all night, this throws customers into the mix, so we have to be extra careful. But that's not the interesting part...

Enter some guy, probably in his late 40s or early 50s. He walks up to me as I'm going by with my machine, and the following happens, he'll be SG and I'll be Me:


&gt;SG: Do you know where I can find this light bulb?

&gt;Me: Not sure, but the light bulb aisle is over there (pointing to it)

&gt;SG: You're not gonna help me find it?

&gt;Me: I am not familiar with specialty light bulbs, and I am just here to clean (thinking to myself do you not see this bigass machine in front of me‽)


He goes off after that and I assume goes looking for his precious bulb. Cool! Done! On with cleaning! I make a loop around and come back on a second pass to cover the other half of the aisle I was doing. This guy sees me again and walks right up to me again and shoves a light bulb package in my face:


&gt;SG: SEE? This is the light bulb I wanted!

&gt;Me: Okay...? (Congratulations! Do you want a medal or something?)

&gt;SG: You work here so you should know where everything is!

&gt;Me: Sorry but my job doesn't require me to memorize the location of every item in the store. Again, I'm here to clean.


He walks away again and I shake my head afterward. I can understand asking someone who looks like they're putting product out, (and there were quite a few around, it was near Christmas after all and there was a crap-ton of freight to deal with) but why come to ME when I'm clearly doing something that DOESN'T involve stocking merchandise‽ Durr.

wrecklessheart,Grown woman doesn't understand why cutting in line is rude.,"This happened a while ago and for some reason popped back into my head today.

So I worked as a cashier for a drugstore last year. Over the summer we sold beach chairs and the like.

I'm ringing out this middle aged woman who seems a little stuck up and but generally isn't being rude or anything... yet. She's buying a lot of stuff. The store is very busy and there's a long line at each register.

Her: ""How much are those chairs over there?"" *points across the store at a display*

Me: ""Hm, I'm honestly not sure, we just put those up and haven't made sale signs yet. Do you want to grab one so I can check?""

Her: ""Nah, it's fine. I don't need it. Have a good one."" 

And she leaves.

I ring out a few more people and ten minutes have gone by. The woman strolls back into the store, walks up to my line with the chair she said she didn't want, and cuts a little old lady in line who had just put her stuff on the counter almost pushing her out of the way.

Me: ""Um, I'm really sorry but this woman is next in line.""

Rude Lady: ""Excuse me?! I was JUST here. I need the price on this.""

Me: ""I understand but this woman was just about to cash out and you've already left the store, you'll need to get back in line.""

RL: ""Are you f***ing serious?! What's the big deal?""

Me: *fed up with people cutting others in line constantly* ""Because you just cut her in line and she's been waiting..""

Old lady: ""It's okay dear, obviously she must REALLY need that chair. You can check it for her."" 

Me: *scans the chair* it's $20.

RL: ""Was that so hard? Thanks."" Drops the chair to the floor in front of the counter and takes off muttering under her breath.

Me: ""Thank you, ma'am. Sorry about that.""

Old lady: ""Oh sweetheart, it's okay. You handled that very well. People these days! Don't you worry, she was just rude.""

The next day, my manager called me into her office and condescendingly asked what I could or shoud have done differently about the situation and told I was in the wrong for not letting her cut. I guess the shift supervisor saw the whole thing happen and as she usually did with her coworkers, she bad mouthed me to the manager.

wijjj,Worst last day ever,"Long time lurker, first time poster, etc 

I recently left my part time job in a relatively expensive department store, so I had my fair share of difficult or unpleasant customers, but this one really took the biscuit.  On my last day I had to take an item back to another floor which was shared with the jewellery department, and as I walked past the rings a couple got my attention. 

Long story short: I had to find a colleague to help my ex boyfriend exchange a promise ring he had bought for a smaller size while the girl it was for (aka the one he had dumped me for) stood there giggling. Nothing technically wrong over the interaction except the context, but I'd have taken 1000 customers shouting at me about being sold out of navy socks over that.

catsandcoconuts,are you gonna pay for it?,"on the weekends, I work at the customer service counter of a large healthy grocery store chain. I basically do returns, help the cashiers, etc. this gem happened literally yesterday.

security is minimal at my store and there is a lot of shoplifting so I do what I can to help the security people, usually just checking people's carts as they're checking out to see if they left anything at the bottom that the cashier can't see. 

so, lo and behold, i notice this woman has a container of protein or acai or whatever healthy powder at the bottom of her cart tucked away. I pick it up and say, ""oh did you wanna get this as well?"" 

I could totally tell she was scrambling for a lie, and after a few seconds she says, ""that's not mine"". 

sure. whatever. so I hand it to the cashier to put aside, and we exchange eye-rolls.

I walk away sightly, and the lady pays for her stuff. one millisecond later she GRABS the item out of the cashier's hand, and goes, ""oh wait, maybe it IS mine."" she's literally pretending to ponder about it, and starts trying to put it in her bag.

cute, but no. the cashier says ""okay...are you gonna pay for it?"" the lady looks genuinely confused, then just says ""no"", the cashier holds out her hand, and the lady gives it back looking like she just got caught with her hand in the cookie jar. more eye-rolls ensue.

Now, we have a small basket of Halloween costumes for dogs and cats, that are 80% off. We are just trying to empty our stock. But, as Halloween is very much over, there is not a whole lot of variety left. Makes sense, right? Only to the sensible. 

I greeted CIW as she walks in, get no response, and continue with my work.  CIW, meanwhile, goes  to this costume basket and starts pawing (lol) through what's left. Here is what followed:


CIW: ""Excuse me, you only have the skeleton costumes left, and they are for dogs. I want a pumpkin costume, but for my cat.""

Me: ""Oh I'm so sorry about that! What you see there is all we have left. The items are 80% off though, and a toy sized dog costume will probably fit most cats. :))).""

CIW: ""I didn't ask for a fucking skeleton costume, and it's ridiculous you do not have any more!""

Then she left.

I had an old guy decide to write his own prices on the items he put in his cart. For example, he grabbed a package of Advil, looked at the shelf tag for the generic ibuprofen next to it, and wrote the generic price on the Advil box with a ballpoint pen. 

He went through the store and did this with everything he wanted to buy, always writing down the wrong price from some other item that happened to be somewhat nearby.   

When he got to the checkout, Surprise! Surprise! none of the items rang up at the prices he had written on them. 

We argued back and forth about this with him insisting that whatever price he wrote on the box somehow proved the register wrong, and me trying to explain that if everyone just made up their own prices and haggled over everything then the checkouts would never move and the store would just lose money and go out of business. The old man finally left without buying anything. 

Of course, that left a bunch of items that couldn’t go back on the shelves for sale because they all had erroneous prices written on the packaging in ink. He said he was going to our competitor across the street. Fine by me. He can go ruin their stock for all I care. ",TalesFromRetail,620,1511730151
Fiishbait,"""I could pay that for a new scarf, I'm not paying that for a scarf from a charity shop!""","So, there I was yesterday stood at the till with quite a few people in the shop, due to some christmas market (it's November folks....) when Confused Old Lady had a mini tirade.

COL?: ""There's no price on this, how much is it?"" she asked as she placed a scarf on the counter.

Luckily I was on &amp; noticed it was one of the new stock items, not a second hand/donated item.

Me: ""One sec', I'll go grab the hanger that has the price label"" which I'd also need for the barcode if she wanted the item.

COL?: ""I don't want the hanger, I just want the scarf, how much is it?""

Me: ""The price is on the hanger that you took the scarf from, I need that to see the price...""

Barely walked halfway towards the stand where new items are hanging.

COL?: ""So how much is it?""

Me: ""Soon find out, one sec'...""

I grab the hanger that she'd left at other end of the shop (thanks for that btw...) &amp; head back to her.

*holding out hanger that has a large label hanging from it with price marked on it*

Me: ""Label shows it here, that it's £3.50.""

COL?: ""How much? I'm not paying that much for a scarf in a charity shop, you're all too expensive around here!"" 

(our shop is one of the two *ridiculously* cheap shops in the area, admittedly other can be pricey).

Me: ""This isn't donated goods, this is brand new stock, hence the price a bit higher than the scarves in the box here"" *points out the box right near us with a large £1 sign on it*

COL?: ""It's ridiculous, no one would pay that much for a second hand...""

Me: ""It's not second hand, it's brand new, never been used nor donated"".

This went back &amp; forth a couple more times.

Meanwhile a woman nearby was smiling &amp; piped up the same, that it was a new item. COL? wasn't having any of it &amp; started to storm off, when nearby woman looking at me said ""Shops around here are expensive tbh...""

Most of our stuff is £1, if that's expensive, you're all in for one hell of a shock when you hit any other shop in this area...

I was looking forward to locking the shop at 1700. At least, would've done if three people hadn't decided to walk in at 1659, despite door closed (normally wedged open), lights at front of shop off &amp; the two of us stood there with coats on &amp; ready to go...",TalesFromRetail,1965,1511706486
bobafett8192,Phone Calls Don't Take Priority,"On mobile, sorry for any formatting mistakes.

This happened a few weeks ago at the cell phone provider I work at. An old lady walks in saying she's having trouble with her phone. I quickly look up her account to see if the phone is still in warranty.
I'll be Me and she's be OL.


Me-So I see that you've had your phone for over a year so it is no longer in warranty. You also have no protection plan on it so the best option would be to upgrade if the problem is that bad for you.


OL-Well I just moved from (state halfway across the country) and they just replaced my phone with this one a few weeks ago. Also, I haven't had my phone for more than a few months.


I look at her account to see any signs of a replacement phone being sent out. Nothing. I tell her and she star5s to become irate.


OL-Well I'll just call the store from back home and see what they have to say about that!


She then calls the other store and starts to bitch at the girl that answers the phone. The girl from the other store will be S.


OL-Hi, I'm in a store at (my location) and they aren't helping me out. When did I get my phone? 


S- Ma'am, I'm in the middle of helping a customer here in the store currently. If you give me a few minutes I can look it up.


OL-See, this is why I hate you people. I'm on the phone with you now so I should be taken care of first, not people in the store.


I just stood there thinking, does she really expect someone to ignore the person right in front of them to answer her ridiculous questions over the phone?


OL hangs the phone up and walks away from our store. ",TalesFromRetail,620,1511659667

Kabukikitsune,There's something wrong with this shirt...,"Years ago, while working in retail management, I had something of a doozy of a return.  The store I managed was one of those cheap clothing stores.  You know the type, not off brand, but not expensive either.  

I'm sitting in the back of the store, working on paperwork, when I get a call from the men's department.  The clerk there has to process a return, but is running into some trouble.  Oh fun.

I head over, only to see a rather irate gentleman standing there, and a very unnerved clerk.  The man is trying to return a handful of things. Shoes, socks, a sport coat, and a shirt.

&gt;me:  So, what's the problem here?

&gt;clerk:  Well, there's something wrong with his shirt and jacket.  I wasn't sure how to process it.

I pick up the shirt, which had been crammed into a bag, and notice two things right off the bat.  First, the shirt STINKS to high heaven.  Smells vaguely like cleaning fluid. Second, the thing is split right up the back.

&gt;me:  That is odd.  Did it happen to you when you were wearing it?

&gt;customer: Nah, it wasn't mine.  Was my dad's.

&gt;me: Ah, sorry about that. 

At this point, my eyes were starting to water, so I tucked the shirt back in its bag, and turned to the jacket.  Same story, smelled bad, and was split up the back.  That's too much of a coincidence for me. Turning to the man, I ask:

&gt;me:  Just curious, but did your father come in to buy this himself, or did you buy it for him?

&gt;customer:  I bought it.  

&gt;me: hmm.  Birthday?

&gt;customer: His funeral.  Wanted him to look good.  Just need my money back, can't afford to let that go to waste.

So yes, the man had come in, bought his father a new sport coat and shirt, shoes, and socks for a funeral, then after the viewing; only to strip the corpse and try to return everything.  He claimed that they weren't worn...which I suppose is technically correct.  Didn't take too kindly to me informing him that I couldn't accept the return.  Ultimately, police got involved and the man was sent packing with everything, and a banning from the store.

I wish this was a one off event, but honestly this kind of thing happened on a rather regular basis.",TalesFromRetail,2734,1511571578
thiccwitch,Please don't throw winter boots at me.,"So I used to work at a shoe store, and this story is from last winter.


It was around 11 am in the mall and, for whatever reason, I was the only one scheduled to work for the next three hours. I had a class I needed to leave for at 2 pm, so I called my co-worker asking them to come in about 10mins early so I would be able to run for the bus. 


Now, as I'm on the phone with my co-worker, a customer comes in. I greet them and tell them about our sales and they raise their hand to shoo me off as she yells in my direction &gt;""I can read, sweetie.""


Rude. 


So I just smile apologetically and go back to finishing up my call. 
After I hang up the customer gives me a mean look and tells me it's rude to talk to my friends while I'm working. Not that I owe it to her, but I clarify, saying that I was asking a co-worker to come in earlier so I can get to my later class. She rolls her eyes at me and holds up a men's boot. She asks me in a condescending tone

 &gt;""Will this fit my husband?""


&gt;""What size is he?"" I asked back.


&gt;""I don't know. Will this fit him?""


&gt;""I'm sorry, but I don't know if it will fit him. Is he with you so he can try it on? I can keep the display one up here for you.""


She raises her voice again and slams her hand on the table. &gt;""He is NOT here with me. I just want to buy him these shoes. Get me a pair that will fit him.""


I am baffled at this point, and I try to politely explain that I can't grab him a pair of shoes if I don't know what size he is because she might have to come back to exchange them for the correct size. 


And this lady was not having it. She threw the display boot at my face. Luckily it didn't leave me with a black eye. I called security and she was banned.

chicklet308,Lady complains she can't carry all the items she just bought,"I used to work in a cosmetics and toiletries chain store as a Christmas temp, and whilst it was mostly a lovely experience, given that it was Christmas time we did get a few crazies. This was my favourite one because I was so close to losing it and laughing when it happened.

So it's the Saturday before Christmas, pretty much the busiest and most hectic time you could decide to do all your Christmas shopping in one go. Not that it stopped this lady from attempting it. I'm on the tills, and she comes up with about 6 huge boxes, that were toiletries giftsets. Each one was the size of like a small suitcase, and contained a number of full-size toiletries in it. So they were huge, and weighed quite a lot. But they were half price so people were buying lots of them, I didn't think anything of it and just assumed she was shopping with someone who could help her carry them all. So I finish ringing her up, and wish her a Merry Christmas and go to serve the next customer. I'm M and the lady is L:

&gt;L: (huffs) these are so heavy! 

&gt;M: haha yeah, you're getting full-size products for such a great price but they are quite bulky! 

&gt;L: how do you expect me to carry all this home? 

&gt;M: (trying to think why on earth that's my problem) would you like some extra carrier bags to help distribute the weight a bit? 

&gt;L: (huffs again) how would that help? I'm going on the bus too, this is going to be a nightmare. I can't even carry them to the bus stop myself. I need another person to help.

At this point she's eyeballing me, and I swear I think she was trying to get me to say I'd walk her to the bus stop. Bear in mind the closest bus stop to this shop was a good 10 minute walk, on a good day. With how crowded it was outside, it would have taken 15 minutes easily. And besides, I'm obviously at work??? I decide to pretend I have no clue what she's hinting at and hope she leaves.

&gt;M: Christmas shopping eh, such a stress! Have a nice rest of your day!

I then very clearly turn to the next customer and start serving them before she can directly ask me to leave work and help her. She just stares at me a bit longer then walks away muttering to herself about how ""this is ridiculous"" and ""how can anyone carry this much"".

SquidRuby,Does falling over get me a refund?,"Yesterday I had a gem of a level I've never seen. For reference i work in a pawn shop, mostly in our retail department.

So an older gentleman (50-60y/o) walked in with his wife, and a television, wanting a refund. Reason for refund being power cable feels loose, then that his signal kept dropping out. I had time so i decided to test it with him there.

Cable was fine, so i plugged in an aerial to test the picture. Picture was flawless, even whilst wriggling the 'loose' power cable and the aerial. After that i suggested to the customer that perhaps his outlet at home was playing up, as it was fine here. He of course got pissy saying he had a new aerial installed only 2 years ago and that his house is only 80 years old(?) so it couldn't be that.

I went and asked the manager what she would like to do, as the TV was fine, and she said to offer him an exchange, but not a refund as the product wasn't faulty. Of course he didn't like that so the manager eventually came out to back me. 

Now, the tvs are across from the counter, with a row of sports equipment in between. People *could* walk through it, or walk around it like a normal person. To get to the tvs, the gentleman started walking around the normal way, then stopped and grabbed his wife. After whispering in her ear, she walked around the normal way and he stayed put.

After that, he did the most ridiculous thing i have seen a human do. He carefully tip-toed his way through half the stock, then ever so delicately hooked his foot through a piece of stock. What followed of course was the most dramatised face-plant i have ever seen a grown man make. Full on sprawl, groaning and carrying on. 

Seeing the whole set up, the manager and I simply stepped out of his way so he could get up. After getting up, he simply looked at us and said 'so can I have my money back'?

No, no you can't. He ended up leaving with an exchanged tv so no doubt he'll be back, but watching back the camera footage brightened my entire week, and even now i can't stop laughing thinking about it. ",TalesFromRetail,2225,1511241709

This happened a few years ago. I was 18 and it was my first job, working over the phone customer service for a major cell phone company. We'll say M is me and C is customer 


M: “Hi, thank you for calling X, how can I help you today?” 


C: “Yes, I'd like to check my account.”


M: “Sure thing. What's your cell phone number?”


His cell phone didn't bring up an account, which was weird (since we're a cell phone company), but we had other ways of pulling up an account. 


M: “I'm sorry, that didn't pull up anything. May I have your social?”


He gave me that, but still didn't bring up anything. 


M: “I'm so sorry, I still can't find your account. Let's try address.”


Still nothing


M: “I'm sorry, still having difficulty. Let's try address.”


Nothing. 


M: “So sorry, let's try first and last name.”


I could tell every single time I asked for more info, he was getting more and more frustrated. 


I finally said, “I'm so sorry I can't seem to find your account, you are calling X mobile right?” 


C: “No. I'm calling Bank of America.” 


Mind you,he sat through our automated system which greets you ‘Thank you for calling X”, which mentions the name of the company while you're waiting on hold, which I also mentioned when he and I connected. 


M: “Oh. I'm sorry. This is X for the cell phone company.”


C: “You are a fucking idiot. You should be fired.”


Then dramatically hung up at that point. 


Oh yes sir, it is my fault our company name got mentioned at least 3 times to you, and you never noticed. But I'm the idiot. Idiot. 


BTW, back then, aside from dialing *2 from your actual cell phone, it was very difficult to get an 800 number. 


So so so so so glad I don't deal with customers anymore. This happened in 2006 and it's the story I'll always tell of those days.

Tamack,"If you're going to rush an order, pick it up when you say you're going to.","I'm going to try to be succinct here, so I may or may not miss some necessary details. I apologize in advance.

I've been working at a trophy shop as the main engraver for over 5 years. I started school again recently, so my hours were cut down and I'm now limited to doing just the difficult stuff (crystal, acrylics, custom items) while everyone else does the easy stuff (trophies and plaques). It's been working out fine so far.

In the beginning of October, a customer placed an order for 8 pieces of crystal to be sandblasted. The due date was listed as the end of October. Three days before the due date, I had to email the customer because she still hadn't sent the information to be engraved. She emailed back that she needed 12 pieces and that the ceremony was on November 30, so she'd like to pick them up on November 27.

Great. I moved the order to Monday, November 13 so that I would remember to send the proofs in a timely manner. Unbeknownst to me, she called to pay 50% of the total and my coworker told her that the order would be ready for pickup on November 13. 

On November 7, she called asking where the proofs were. I wasn't in, so my boss just informed her that she will see them soon. My boss passed on to me that she was hoping to have her proofs soon, and I just figured I'd send the proofs on Thursday or Friday, two days before originally planned. Keep in mind that we're also working on a 1,800 trophy order due on Monday, plus all the various orders placed throughout the week. I'm engraving roughly 8 orders per day, which doesn't sound like a lot, but there are a lot of factors that can make an order take 3 minutes or 3 hours and I'm only in the store for 4-5 hours a day. 

November 9 (Thursday), she called again wondering where the proofs were. Again, I was at school, so my boss just decided to do it for me, knowing that I was too busy to worry about a proof the customer doesn't really need until next week. She approved the proofs three days later, on November 13. Note that this is the day she thought she was going to be able to pick them up, a fact that I was unaware of.

I immediately emailed her back to let her know that I would be working on her order at the end of the week and that it would be ready for pickup on November 20. I was feeling really good about this because it was an entire week before she said she wanted to pick them up, plus it gave me plenty of time to do it on Friday, our busiest day, and possibly Saturday if I didn't get them all done. Again, this is an order of 12 crystal pieces that the customer wanted sandblasted. I knew the order would take me at least 3 hours, uninterrupted. Planning my time around an order like that is important.

Apparently, she called the next morning and chewed my boss out for not having the order complete when she was promised. My boss told me that he informed her that her order wasn't needed until the 27th, so we were prioritizing orders that customers needed sooner. He also told her that her delay in the proof approval delayed the production, which he had made clear would happen in the email.

She wasn't having it, so to placate her, he told her she could pick up her crystal on Friday at 5:30. We close at 6:00. She said that was fine.

I ended up staying late on Thursday clearing out my schedule on Friday and skipping lunch on Friday so that I could make it into the store by 12:30 to start her order. Because of the interruptions of other customers and last-minute orders, it took me 3 hours just to engrave the crystal. Sandblasting didn't even begin until 5:00. I was stressing out because sandblasting is a very lengthy process and I knew that they wouldn't all be completed by 5:30. I was right. We didn't finish her order until almost 6:30.

But it didn't matter because she didn't show up. She didn't even call to let us know that she wouldn't be showing up. Now her order is going to sit around our store for over a week because I guarantee she won't pick it up until the original date promised: November 27.

On the bright side, I didn't have to go into work on Saturday to complete her order.",TalesFromRetail,2338,1511120101
tabisaurus,"""I said don't wrap it.""","It's been a couple years since I posted in here, but I'm back with new stories!

So, I work in a candle store. We also sell other home fragrance items, like car fresheners, reed diffusers, and (most importantly to this story) plug-in air fresheners and scent refills a la Glade Plugins. Our scent refills are small glass vials that break REALLY easily. 

This one woman is standoffish from the moment she comes in. I ask if she needs help, she doesn't even let me finish my sentence before saying ""I know what I'm here for, goodbye"". It's a busy Saturday in the holiday season and I have inventory to unload, so I leave her alone. 

Later, she's ready to go and I check her out. She's gotten 4 scent refills, a large candle (weighs nearly 2lb), and a couple wax melts. Since 90% of our products are encased in glass, we automatically wrap items in tissue paper once they've been rung up. While I'm fiddling with the register (it's a finicky little bitch), my coworker starts wrapping up her scent refills and words spout from this woman's mouth like water flowing from a broken dam. 

*""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! DON'T WRAP THOSE. DON'T! THAT TISSUE PAPER IS JUST TRASH. IT'S TRASH HERE, IT'LL BE TRASH IN MY HOME, STOP THAT RIGHT NOW""* 

My coworker and I step back a little bit and I go into Manager mode.

""Well, ma'am, we wrap it in tissue paper so they don't break, I really suggest letting us wrap it-"" 

*""I said don't. wrap. it."" 

Tired, I just shrug and tell my coworker to just put them in the bag and let her go. I finish up her transaction and send her on her merry way. 

Not even two feet out of the store and she drops the bag. The huge candle crushed all 4 refill vials and the look on her face was absolutely priceless. She looked like she's swallowed a live bee.

thealmightysab,Rude lady thinks she can eat for free and leave. Now banned from our store!,"Hey there! Back with another weird story. I’m on mobile so formatting blah. Also, kinda long story, but worth it.

Backstory: There’s a lady who will come into our store, usually around noon with four (annoying and loud) misbehaving children. Of course, she’s completely oblivious to all of this. Yay. She would pack all of them into the cart, pick out some sort of produce (apples, bananas, oranges, etc) and give it to them to “hold” and the kids would eat all of it. Then she would come up to the register and give me the whole, “Oops, sorry. I didn’t even see that they did that!” 
I would call my manager and basically ask “Wtf am I supposed to weigh?” and usually they would either get the same amount of whatever produce and she would complain that she’d “not gotten that much!” or “mine were WAY smaller!” So my manager would just wave it off and let it go. 

Today, she didn’t get away with it because my manager and I were in a bad mood. 

I was QUIETLY working at my register when I heard the parade of obnoxious children run into the store with the lady on her phone completely ignoring them. Shocker! She piled all of them into the cart and headed straight for the produce. I continued working at my register and lost track of her until she came up to my register. She huffed and puffed at the little old lady in front of her writing a check while all of her children were screaming in her cart. She’s still on the phone and I hear the (R)ude (L)ady talking semi-quietly on her phone.

RL: “Yeah, I’ll be home soon, there’s a slow ass hag in front of me.”

Thankfully, the little old lady (Who is literally maybe the nicest person I’ve ever met) doesn’t hear that well, so she’d missed RL’s comment. After hearing that, I purposefully take my damn sweet time processing her check and asking her how her grandchildren are doing. I finish bagging her groceries and set them in her cart. As she’s pulling away, RL decides she’s not going fast enough and ACTUALLY PUSHES HER OUT OF THE WAY WITH HER CART. When the little old lady turns to look at her, she’s smiles smugly.

RL: “Sorry.”

The little old lady frowns and walks away. Now the real fun begins. Before she says anything, I notice that each child has banana peels in their laps and the youngest has banana all over their face. There’s even a peel inside RL’s purse.

RL: “My kids ate these. Here.”

She proceeds to grab and dump all of the peels on to my register and starts to leave.

Me: “Ma’am, I need some sort of payment, you can’t just leave after eating all of these.”

RL turns and glares at me. She backs up a little. 

RL: “Just weigh the peels or something, I don’t have time for this!”

I glare back at her.

Me: “Even if I was allowed to do that, I’d need ALL of the peels.”

I gesture to the one in her purse (gross). She throws it at me. 

RL: “Here’s your peel. Now weigh them!”

Her face is getting angrier by the minute.

Me: “I’ll have to call for a manager.”

That’s when I notice the ‘Organic’ sticker on all of the peels, which means it will be more expensive. $1.29 /lb in fact. She slams her hand on my register as I’m about to call.

RL: “This is ridiculous!! Just weigh my hand or something!!!”

As she’s pressing her hand down, she’s also squeezing the peels as hard as she can, making a huge mess of peel and banana mush. I’ve had it.

Me: “MANAGER TO THE FRONT. Please.”

The (M)anager thankfully was not far and came rushing up.

M: “What can I do for y-“

He sees it’s this particular lady and the mess on my register. Before he can open his mouth again she wails at him.

RL: “Your cashier has been so RUDE to my family and I! All we want to do is pay for our bananas and GO! She’s being incredibly difficult and even made this disgusting mess!”

I’m fuming at this point and my manager is getting a little ticked off knowing this lady is a liar because I would never do something this childish. 

RL: “What are you going to DO about THIS for us???!!??”

I turn to my manager.

Me: “Her and her children ate an entire bunch of bananas, tried to leave without paying and when I called her out on it, she told me to weigh her hand and squished these peels.”

The manager nodded.

M: “Go ahead and weigh her hand. Whatever it comes out to, she can pay that. Then, she’s no longer welcome in our store.”

Of course she’s shocked and stammering trying to claim that I lied about the entire story and it was nothing like that. Obviously my manager was having none of it and told her to put her banana covered hand back on the scale. She did and pressed as hard as she could.
Well, she’s not too smart and forgot how scales work. She’d pressed it down and it came up as about 30 lbs. 

Me: “And your total is going to be $38.54. Will you be using cash or card?”

She was completely outraged and started yelling at my manager and I calling us crooks (ironic) and that she’d never pay something so ridiculous. My manager threatened to call the police and report her for theft if she didn’t. She screamed some more and threw two $20’s at me. I gave her the change which she snatched out of my hand and continued to scream and curse down the exit and out the door.

Me: “Thank you for shopping, have a nice day!”

EDIT: Wow! This blew up. Thank you so much for all of the comments, I loved reading other stories! Thank you for my first gold too!! So cool!

For those asking why she came through my line when she didn’t plan on paying: In the backstory I provided, my manager would either grab new fruit and she would complain, or just wave it off and let her go. Basically she would either pay less than what actually would have been owed or nothing at all. 

For those asking about cute little old lady (her name is Eda) I asked a coworker to text me if she saw her and ask if she’s okay. Nothing yet, cross your fingers.

To clear up some things: No, she had nothing else except banana peels. 
I asked little old lady about her grandchildren in the time it took for me to process her check, maybe 15-20 seconds.",TalesFromRetail,8983,1511033344
Maigerz,The old lady who ran away from home to the liquor store,"This story is not mine, but my mom's. 

A little background - my mom works at a liquor store that's open to everyone, as they have candy for customer's kids and dog treats. She often says that they have treats for adults, treats for kids and treats for dogs. So, she adores talking about the doggy regulars, which includes a German shepherd pup named Apollo and an old, fat lady named Bernadette. 

But this is about another old lady dog, Boots. 

Some of the dogs just walk straight in before their owners. They're so familiar with my mom that they'll go right to the counter and wait for a treat (a few getting so excited they nearly knock her over). One night, the doors opened to reveal Boots. She milled around for a bit before my mom ushered her in, thinking her owner will be right behind her. 

But after getting a treat and after waiting a bit, there was no sign of him. Her coworker gets in contact with boots' owner shortly after. 

And here its revealed that boots escaped from her yard and made a beeline to the liquor store, journeying through the car dealership parking lot to get there (her home was right next to it). She was brought home safely, my mom the whole time reminding her owner to not be mad at boots. 

This story will always be one of my favourites from her, as the idea of an elderly dog running away to the liquor store never fails to make me smile. (:",TalesFromRetail,1292,1510985745
throwawayx64,"""Is it cool if I pay in $5 bills?""","This happened over a year ago but it'll always be a story I'll remember - nothing too crazy but definitely something out of the ordinary. I work at a fruit stand that sells products that usually cost at or above $1k. I asked this man and his girlfriend what they needed help with that day, and they said they wanted two unlocked fruitPhone seven pluses, which cost after tax, well over $2k. I said sure thing, brought the two phones out, and this is how it turned out:

&gt; Customer (Cx): ""is it cool if I pay in five dollar bills?"" 

&gt; Me, thinking he's joking: ""yeah sure thing"" 

&gt; Cx: ""ok cool"" 

At this point Cx asks his girlfriend to open the backpack she's wearing and pulls out about 20 stacks of $5 bills 

&gt; Cx: ""Do you guys have like a cash counting machine or something?""

&gt; Me: ""technically yeah but for this I have to count everything manually... and I'm gonna need a manager for this, this might take a while""

&gt; Cx: ""yeah sure no prob""

Literally ten minutes later me and my manager are done counting, double counting, and triple counting the cash, and then I send the customer and his girlfriend on their way. The entire time I was on closing duties that evening, me and my manager were talking about what he did for a living and how someone could carry literally thousands of dollars in five dollar bills around.

I answer with a mild sigh, but it had been a pleasant day and I wasn't too bothered to take the call - just hoped it wouldn't be long or someone claiming they're ""only ten minutes away"" expecting me to stay open for them. A disgruntled woman was on the other line, we'll call her Pie Hole (PH).

PH: Can you tell me what sizes your pies are for Thanksgiving?

PH: Well someone else told me 8"" and someone else told me 9"" and someone else told me 10"" so which is it??

PH: I just need to know how big they are. 

Me: Well they're 9"" for certain. The thing is that the base of the pie is about 8"", and from one edge of the crust to the other it's about 10"".  But that's only crust. There's really 9"" of solid pie.

PH: CAN YOU JUST TELL ME HOW BIG THE PIES ARE?

Me: Yes miss, as I stated the pies are 9"". They'll serve about 8-10 people if that's more helpful to you. 

PH: Ugh. Is there anyone there who can *help* me??

Me: No miss, we've already closed and I'm the only person here.

PH: Well when can I call back that someone will be there to *help* me??

Me: Tomorrow morning. 

PH: (Literally yelling) *WHAT TIME*???

Me: We open at 7AM.

PH: I'll be calling in the morning. 

Me: Okay, enjoy your night miss.

I could not have been more descriptive. 

I just think she wanted a dispute. It almost seems like the clientele I experience has this nagging need to get someone fired or be proven right or to feel like they've been mistreated and victimize themselves.

snortybeagle,Customer expected hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise to cost next to nothing,"Many years ago, I worked for a fancy gift boutique that sold candles, perfumes, lotions and other random items. We were located in a shopping district with heavy foot traffic, so our store was always busy. 

One weekend, we had a promotion for lotions where if you purchased one, you'd get two for free. We were trying to clear out old stock, so this was the best way.

A woman came in, grabbed a shopping bag, spotted the sale sign and proceeded to fill her bag to overflowing. I watched, impressed, from the other side of the store as the shopping bag's seam strength was pushed to its limit.

The woman then waddled over to me and asked me how much her total would be. She was beaming, saying, ""I can't believe this amazing promotion!""

Keep in mind, this was a fancy, upscale boutique, so each item was pretty pricey. The promotion was indeed amazing if you were looking to treat yourself or to scratch a few names off of your holiday shopping list. The woman had filled the bag to capacity, so while she would receive quite a lot of goods for free, she would definitely still pay quite a large total at the register if she checked out. I counted and it would have been a little over $300, plus tax.

I told her this, and her eyes bulged out of her head. 

&gt;Lady: But..but the sale..I don't understand. Why is it so much?

&gt;Me: Because you are paying for a certain number of items, to get two additional items for free per item. Your total based on those items comes out to $300+ aside from the sales tax.

&gt;Lady: But if I'm getting items for free, how am I paying so much money? I don't get it.

&gt;Me: *stares blankly*

&gt;Lady: Never mind.

Then, without warning, she let go of the shopping bag's handles and angrily rushed toward the door. It all happened so quickly, yet somehow, with cat-like reflexes, I caught the bag's straps just before it hit the floor and crushed my feet. By some miracle, I did not sprain my wrists. The bag weighed a great deal.

My manager rushed over to make sure I was okay. She was super pissed and called security to locate the woman, but they failed to do so. The manager told me to keep an eye out for her and to alert her if she ever came back.

About a week later, the woman came back in, acting as if nothing had happened. I immediately went to the back to alert my manager, who stormed up to the woman and in a very serious tone, asked her to leave.

&gt;Lady: *(shocked gasp)* What?! Why?

&gt;Manager: You were in here last week and you nearly damaged over $300 worth of merchandise and nearly injured my employee severely. I don't tolerate that sort of thing in my store.

&gt;Lady: How would I have done any of that? I don't understand!

&gt;Manager: I have you on tape dropping a bag full of merchandise, which would have hit the floor or possibly fractured my employee's feet, but luckily she caught it beforehand. 

&gt;Lady: So then why am I being banned?

&gt;Manager: Because it could have ended very badly had my employee NOT caught the bag. You simply let go of the straps and rushed out. Why would you do that?!

&gt;Lady: I just don't understand why I'm being banned!! I did nothing wrong!  


The woman continued to insist that she did nothing wrong and refused to respond to my manager's question as to why she simply let go of the bag full of fragile merchandise. She only left when the manager called security and had her escorted out. The woman was banned for one year, but I moved on to a new job a few months later, so I have no idea if she ever went back to the store before that.",TalesFromRetail,741,1510855186
dark_forebodings_too,"""I don't care how many yards it is, I want a FULL ROLL!","I'm on mobile so apologies for formatting and whatnot.

I work at a small fabric store. Its a small business and also a physically small store with no back room or storage space, so we have a separate warehouse and the owner brings deliveries every day. If a customer needs something we're out of or needs a large amount of fabric, we contact the owner and ask him to bring it later in the day or the next day.

On Saturday, a woman comes up to the register and tells me she placed an order. I will be me, she will be SL for stubborn lady, and the store owner will be O)

SL: I'm here to pick up the fabric I ordered!
Me: Okay, can you tell me your name and what fabric you ordered?
SL: it's [name] and it was a white fabric.
(We don't have a back room but if someone has ordered something we leave it in the hallway that leads to the employees only bathroom so that no one else buys it. I go find her fabric and bring it back to the counter.)
SL: No! That's not the one I wanted!
Me: it says here on your order form that this is in fact the type of fabric that you ordered. 
SL: Well I decided I don't want that one! I want this one instead! (She goes and grabs a different fabric).
Me: If we have that in stock in the warehouse I can have the owner bring it over later today. How many yards do you need?
SL: I want a whole roll!
Me: Well, the fabric you originally picked comes on a 20 yard roll, but the new one you picked out doesn't come like that. It's shipped to the warehouse in very large rolls and then they spin it down, so we can spin a roll with any amount you need.
SL: I don't know how much I need! I just want a full roll!
Me: since the first fabric you ordered comes on a 20 yard roll, would you like 20 yards?
SL: Just get me a full roll!
Me: ....okay

(I call the owner)

Me: [customer name] is here and she wants a different fabric, do you have it in stock?
O: yah I have tons, how many yards does she need?
Me: she won't give me a number, she's just saying she wants a full roll.
O: ...the full roll is 120 yards.
Me: (turning to SL) so the full roll is 120 yards- 
SL: I'll take it!
Me (back on phone): um, she says she'll take the whole thing...
O:... really?
Me: I guess...
O: okay, I'll put it in the car now. Tell her I'll bring it to the store around 4. And if she really takes the whole thing charge her $2.99 per yard instead of $3.99.

(I get off the phone and give SL this information)

SL: so how much will the whole thing cost?
Me: $2.99 per yard for 120 yards will be approximately $360.
SL: WHAAAAAT?!?! I thought it was $50???
Me: that price was for a 20 yard roll of a different type of fabric.
SL: that's way too much money. I can't spend that much. 

(I call the owner back because I don't want him to needlessly lug a 120 yard roll of fabric into his truck)

Me: yah, she doesn't want the full roll.
O: yah that's what I thought. Tell her I'll call her when I'm at the store and I'll help her figure out what she actually needs. 
(I tell this to SL)
SL: You said he'll be here at 4, right? I'm going to call him right at 4!
Me: he might not be here right at 4, so please wait for him to call you. I'll save your order form with your phone number.

When the owner got to the store later and went to call her, we realized she hadn't put her phone number on the order form. I felt a little bad but the owner told me not to worry, it's not my fault she didn't fill out the required info on the form. I'm sure she called angrily the next day to ask why no one called her, but I had the day off so I didn't have to deal with it.",TalesFromRetail,886,1510844539
Sleringaurd,I didn't touch their kid,"So I work as a cashier at a superstore that is only in one part of the country. This particular story happened on a day where I was working the self checkouts. So about halfway into my shift on a Saturday this man comes up to one of the self checkouts with his 3 kids. Two of the kids were in the cart, while one was walking around and just generally being a kid. So the kid walking around ended up seeing the coupon printer and began to open it and try to pull the paper out. Seeing this I stepped in to give a warning about how you can get ink all over yourself, because I had just had that happen. I will be ""Me"" and the customer will be ""OM"" for off-putting man:
&gt;Me: Could you please not open that? You could get ink all over.  
&gt;OM: I would rather you didn't talk to my son.  
&gt;Me: I was just trying to warn him to be careful about the ink in the machine.  
&gt;OM: Yeah I just don't want you talking to my kid.  

At this point I was just confused as to what this guys deal was, and I ended up just walking away to go help other people. Fast forward a few hours later into my shift and I had mostly forgotten about the incident from earlier. My supervisor came up to me and told me I had to go meet with the manager in the office. As soon as he said that I knew what it was going to be about. So once again ""Me"" is me and ""SM"" will be service manager:
&gt;SM: So there was a guy in here with his kids earlier?

At this point I let out an exacerbated sigh
&gt;Me: Yeah he was being confrontational the whole time I tried to help him.  
&gt;SM: Well the wife called and said that you apparently grabbed their kid and ripped him away from the coupon printer.

I was dumbfounded at this point, because first of all the wife was not there and second of all I never got within arms reach of the kid.
&gt;Me: I never touched that kid, and I was never within arms reach of that kid. The wife wasn't even at the store so I don't know where this version of the story came from.  
&gt;SM: So it sounds like she was just exaggerating something she wasn't there to see?  
&gt;Me: Yes.  
&gt;SM: OK. Don't grab peoples kids.  
&gt;Me: Well obviously.

vAbstractz,"Girl steals a laptop, then comes back the week after to fix it.","This is gonna be my first post on the subreddit so I lurked for a few months to see what was going on here. I'm on mobile so formatting etc. etc.

So back to the story, this happened a while back but it was pretty funny so I thought I would post it. This took place in a small computer fixing store which is less than 100 square feet, pretty small for a store. My boss told me that there was a laptop that was stolen a few days ago and I should look out for a small girl (15-17). He knew she stole it because she came into the store and left within 30 seconds without saying a word. We don't have cameras anyway so we couldn't prove it was her.

My boss just tells me to watch out for this girl, maybe she would come back later. A few days later and she showed on the weekend. She started talking with my boss who was pretending not to know what she did, and she wanted to get the laptop that she stole fixed, the thing was that on the bottom of the laptop there was a sticker which we put the name and phone number of the person who dropped it off so we can call them once it is fixed. I don't think she realized we did this and he knew it right away it was her.

After he made sure that it was the stolen laptop he told me to talk to her for a bit while he goes to the front and locks the door and calls the police. I didn't really say much to her, just asking what was wrong with it to stall time. A few minutes later the police came and started questioning her on why she took it and you won't believe the response she gave. She said ""Nobody was using it so I just took it."" Everyone including the cop was baffled at her response, and he took her into the police car.

This was probably the most interesting thing that happened at my job there, I only worked there for a few months anyway.

Edit: Misinformation

Edit 2: For those asking how the store was 100 square feet. He bought a portion of a restaurant and built a small store and built a wall to separate it from the restaurant from the back entrance, he is the only one who works there usually, I only worked for a few months so it wasn't that bad.",TalesFromRetail,610,1510798563

quick background: We are a local, organic farm. We sell local, organic products. This includes delicious raw jersey milk from the creamery down the road. They pasture raise their cows, take excellent care of them and the pasture, etc. 

A tourist (AL for Angry Lady) and her friend walk in, see we sell raw milk and AL's friend asks about it. As I start to explain the benefits of raw milk, and begin to explain why this is okay to consumer, AL butts-in and starts screaming at me about how it's insanely dangerous and how I'm hurting the public by trying to promote it. 

So, I'm pretty well educated on the subject, and because I can literally drive by and see how these cows are being raised, know the owners and are aware of their pathogen testing/safety precautions etc. etc., I start explaining alllll the reasons why she's wrong about this particular raw creamery, but she keeps screaming at me as if I'm magically going to agree with her. Her friend, embarrassed, wanders to the ice cream freezer and finds a local ice cream made with that very same raw cream. Cue AL's friggin' meltdown. 

AL: DON'T EAT THAT. DON'T YOU BUY THAT. THAT'S DANGEROUS.

Me: Ma'am, when you make ice cream, you heat the cream first. The cream becomes pasteurized in the process. It's no longer in it's raw form.

AL: NO. YOU'RE WRONG! HOW DARE YOU TRY TO SELL HER THAT ICE CREAM!

I've lurked here a while and I've just finished a big top/all time binge and instead of commenting on all the posts that I can relate to, I've decided to make a couple of posts for you guys to consume.

I'm going to start with what happened just last night. I was in the smoke section, so, how my store is and by law, there's only one register to sell cigarettes from, and thats at the front of the store, meaning you dont have to come in to buy cigarettes. So the smoke/returns and refunds is one register, and then we have three more registers on the side of it that serve as 'express lane, X items or less' registers. Here is what the layout is Like, if you can't imagine it (note, not the store I personally work in, nor the company I work for) https://imgur.com/a/FOQ0h . 

I was in that section, serving customers in the express lane, when a woman walked out of the store holding some items and went straight to the ciggarette/returns &amp; refunds section and I assumed she wanted to pay for them there, as some customers do, like if they want smokes with their purchase or some smart asses that think they're too good to line up and assume they'll get served quicker because they're the only one waiting (this doesn't work,ppl) 
Anyway, I finish up with my customer and step to this lady. She lays the items ( big pack of expensive womens razors, couple of pairs of those ballet shoe socks, hair removal kit and a tube of mascara) on the counter and this is the conversation that follows 
 M = me 
 L = lady 

&gt;M 'Hi! How can I help you?'


&gt; L 'hi, yes, I'd like a refund on these items, please'


&gt;M 'uh sure, can I see your receipt please'


&gt;L 'I don't have one'

&gt;M 'ok, when did you buy them?'


&gt; L 'oh, um, oh gosh, it was... A while ago,months ago... I know i dont have a receipt but you can look up the purchase on my card? 


&gt;M ' oh, good, you used your rewards card? I could find the purchase like that'


&gt;L ' no, I mean my credit card'



     ....  *bruh* 

&gt;M 'we don't store any credit or debit card information.... Look, let me get my supervisor over. 



She's starting to get agitated and nervous, because why can't we hand over money from the till, damn it? How hard is it to open the till and give away $50 odd dollars? Am I right. Anyway. 

I pull supervisor aside and tell her what happened, how she walked out of the shop holding the products in her hands ect,

&gt;S 'im sorry, my coworker told me you dont have a receipt and also the products were bought a long while ago you stated so that in itself is a reason we can't really refund today'

Whereabouts-Unknown,Give me your name and corporate's number!,"So this happened recently, I was covering the return counter since the Front-End Lead called out and the other managers magically disappeared.

Instead of picking it up he kicks the mess out of his way and pushes his cart towards me. I'll be Me and he'll be OM. 

OM: Hurry up and return this!!! He said as he throw a hose on my counter. 
Me: Sure, I'll just need your receipt. 
OM: Well grab it!!!

I notice it in his cart. We have a large counter between us and the cart is a couple feet behind him. I walk out and around the counter just to the get the receipt. As I come back to my till, I scan the receipt and it comes up 78 days past the original 30. 

Me: I'm sorry, but I can't return this item. The return policy is 30 days and you're 78 days past that. 
OM: Well fucken override it, bitch. 
Me: No can do, we don't have that option.

I write down my first name and Corporate's number.

Me: Well, you're not gonna get that. You don't need my number and you don't need my last name. 

OM: How dare you not give me what I asked for. Corporate is going to fire you when I call them. Just you wait. 

Me: Go ahead, tell corporate I did my job. I'm sure they'll be happy to hear to that. 

OM: I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER!!!

Me: Nope, no more from you. Leave or I'll have security escort you out. 

OM: They can force me out.

TheSti,The Time I Was Offered $200 to be Shot,"So a few years back when i was working retail, i was employed by an army surplus store which i worked selling airsoft and paintball guns. Having been playing airsoft for nearly 6 years at my time of employment i was a pretty knowledgable employee. 

Working at a surplus store we sold old demilitarized police vests among other tactical gear. We get the same question asked about them ""will they stop a bullet"". The short answer? Probably - the answer we legally tell everyone to save our ass if someone tests it out? No. 

One day a customer comes in asking about the vest and i run through my internally scripted memo about them when he offers me $200 if i put the vest on and let him shoot me. Now working in the airsoft section i just assumed he meant airsoft, so i asked ""with an airsoft gun, right?"" (For $200 I'd take an airsoft shot). He replied no, and went on to talk about one of his higher caliber rifles and how he wanted to shoot me. After a few minutes of me explaining the store rules against talk of violence against another person especially an employee, after arguing about why you can't just tell people you want to shoot them, we had to escort him out of the building. 

Never saw him again, but god damn if i don't still remember his ugly mug.

Back in college, I worked at a grocery store as a cashier. This story is about produce. I had all the usual people who would bag their produce together and get upset when I separated it because it cost different amounts and sometimes even people who would ask me what they were buying (as if I knew). One day, a middle-aged woman had a small plastic bag of tomatoes on my belt with the rest of her groceries. 

Cust: I’m sorry, I need to grab those tomatoes first. I don’t want to pay for all the air in the bag! 

*Proceeds to open the bag, release the air, and tie it back up*

Cust: There! No sense in paying for air.  Now you can weigh them. 

Tame and harmless, but still makes me shake my head whenever it comes to my mind. ",TalesFromRetail,3094,1510591837
Sonarbabe,He Tried Calling Out The Wrong Cashier,"Working in retail as long as I have, I've got the roll of being a sweet cashier down to a science. Occasionally however,  a customer will say something so rediculously dumb, I'm left with no other option than to be myself. This happened yesterday. To give a little backstory, I recently hurt my knee and have been stuck on light duty. Meaning, I have to have a chair to sit on in between customers. Normally, I'm the sort who is constantly moving around, so this sucks to begin with. The following happened during a particularly painful moment for me.


Me: *sitting on a folding chair* Morning! How are you today?

Customer: *Unintelligible mumble*

He shops for a bit and comes up. He sees me sitting and decides to get smart. Poor choice.

Customer: You know, sitting at work isn't good for you.

Me: *staring at him unamused while limping to the counter* Neither is having a torn meniscus. Anything else today?

Customer: *sputtering* Uh, I, er. No. Sorry about your knee. *sees crutches and blushes*

As an aside, I get he didn't know I was injured, but this also serves as a cautionary tale about running your mouth before you know the full story.

lawschoolwannabe123,"""I didn't do that."" the lie detector test determined that......... was a lie","So I work in a high-price borderline-fancy lingerie store. We also sell some sleep clothes, sexy outerwear, and beauty products. 

 As is policy, we sensor every bra. Our bras are over $40 each (up to $80) so we don't mess around. 

Today was BUSY. Lots of preteens who just wanted to try on the fancy bras. Whatever, gives me something to do. 

Three girls come in and they're immediately sketchy. Whispering, avoiding me when I ask if they need help. One of the girls moves off on her own. The other two girls corner me and start asking intense questions about a particular type of panty we carry. I notice whenever I start to walk, they follow me IN FRONT of me, trying to keep my attention on them. I'm not the dimmest bulb so I ask them to move aside as I'm receiving a call on my walkie from my manager. Normally I'd call another worker, but we were short staffed and I was the only ones that particular area of the store. 

I walk towards where the other girl went and see her trying to RIP the sensor off the bra. (It doesn't work like that, obviously). I did notice she also had a flimsier bralette with the sensor ripped off (it was RIGHT NEXT TO IT). Someone had placed the sensor too close to the bottom of the fabric so it was easy to rip it off on a bralette. 

I calmly ask her what she's doing. She jumps. Our interaction goes as follows:

Thief: ""I'm just adjusting the straps.""

Me: ""The straps don't need adjusting if you're not trying it on. Is that your bralette?""

Thief: ""I'm just looking at it.""

Me: ""oh, well, it's damaged. Someone ripped the sensor off. I'll have to take that to the back and tell the manager. Now he needs to look over the security footage..""

Thief: ""it wasn't me. I didn't do that.""

Me: ""are you sure?""

Thief: ""... yes.""

Me: ""okay. Well, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. However, I know you're trying to steal that bra--""

Thief: ""I'm sorry...""

Me: ""--so please put it down and leave with your friends, and I'll let you go without calling security."" 

Thief: ""okay.""

She was very squeamish and quiet, probably 70 lbs soaking wet, so I felt bad. 

She ran back to her friends and whispered something to them. They look at me, white as ghosts, and dropped whatever they were looking at to high tail it out of there.

The kicker? As they ran, one of them dropped a panty they'd been holding in their shirtsleeve, and the sensors went off anyway. Nothing happenedX but my manager looked over the footage &amp; now they're not allowed back. 

TL;DR: tiny thieves try to steal from my store. ",TalesFromRetail,637,1510363612
Average_Jane_XIII,"""But I've already paid!""","A few years ago I worked at a popular Men's Suit store. It was wedding season and we had plenty of people coming in to get measured and try on their tux rentals. One evening I was working at the desk alone (co-worker was on break and manager wasn't working that night) and a guy walks in and wants to pick up his tux rental for a wedding. He gives me the name of the wedding party and his tux is the only one left, so I go to the back room and bring it out. When I get back to the desk I tell him the price of the tux rental and ask how he'd like to pay. ""C"" is for Customer, and ""Me"" is self-explanatory.

&gt;C: ""I already paid for my tux rental the day I got measured for it.""

&gt;Me: ""Alright, may I see the receipt please?""

&gt;C: ""I don't have it with me.""

&gt;Me: ""Okay, I'll check the computer.""

I proceeded to ask him for some info and checked the computer for any record of him having paid for the tux rental. Big surprise, there was no record at all of him having paid. Also, if he had paid then it would have definitely shown up in the system.

&gt;Me: ""There is no record of you having paid for the tux rental. If you want to take the tux with you tonight you'll have to pay for it first.""

&gt;C: ""But I've already paid!""

&gt;Me: ""I'm sorry, but if we had processed a payment I would see it in our records.""

&gt;C: ""Look, the wedding is *tomorrow* and I need my tux. Can't I just take it and we can deal with all of this after the wedding?""

&gt;Me: ""I'm sorry, but I can't let you take the tux without paying for it first.""

&gt;C: ""Where is your manager? Let me speak to your manager. *Now*.""

Since my manager wasn't in, I called him on his personal phone and explained the situation to him. I then handed the phone over to the customer so that my manager could *presumably* tell him the exact same thing I did. The customer then hung up the phone and told me that the manager had said it was okay to let him take the tux. I thought it was weird so I called the manager back to make sure the customer was telling the truth. While my back was turned for a *second*, the asshat grabbed the tux and *left*. I turned around and saw him exiting the store and told the manager what happened, and he explained that he certainly did *not* say that the guy could take the tux. Too late, the guy was already gone.

Small detail: our store had a deal that if there were four groomsmen in the wedding party then the groom got his tux for free. My manager solved the above issue by making the groom pay for his own tux, so the party still got one tux for free, it just wasn't the groom's.

TL;DR: Guy stole his tux rental for a wedding and made the groom pay for it.

DBTornado,How would he feel about your behavior?,"Greetings fellow retail employees! A couple of people mentioned wanting to hear this story after my last post, and it's a quick type up on my day off that's not really a day off because no one ever leaves me alone. 


It was a lovely June day, and by lovely I mean exceedingly hot. And not just hot, but hot with somewhere near 150% humidity which made everything in God's creation stickier than Sasha Gray and Mia Khalifa on a giant honey bun. It's that kind of day where you walk from the car to the store and already need a shower. Anyway, I wander in at about 11ish since I have the closing shift, and one of my coworkers is working with a soldier in BDUs. Not an uncommon sight in my area as there is an Army base not far from us, although they usually go to the store that's a bit closer to the base. Nothing seems to be going wrong with the transaction, but I can tell the dude has a bit of an attitude. I walk in the back, set my stuff down, get my name tag on, take a swig from the flask, the usual preparations for a shift in retail hell. 


As I come back to the floor the soldier is starting to get short with my coworker, but still not anything too horrible. It just sounds like a normal communication that will sort itself out. My Store Manager comes in the front door, sharing the closing shift with me. One thing I love about our Store Manager is he takes the same schedule we do. He doesn't open every day and leave by 5, he works opens, mid shifts, closes twice a week. As he walks in his head immediately snaps to the soldier, then back to me, then back to the soldier. I shoot him an odd glance and he comes to the back counter with me. He sets his stuff down on the counter, clocks in, and continues to watch the soldier. And by watch I mean he's staring a hole through this soldier so hard I think the he might set his uniform on fire. As if on some mystical cue from the universe, all hell breaks loose.


The soldier, unhappy with something my coworker said, SLAMS his hands down on the counter and begins berating my coworker. The following is paraphrased because my memory is not all that sharp.


&gt;S: YOU STUPID B**CH ALL I WANTED WAS A F$#@ING UPGRADE AND YOU CAN'T EVEN F#@@ING GET THAT THE F$#K RIGHT?! 


And as he launches into that tirade I can feel a great disturbance in the Force. Like a great beast was awoken in close proximity. I glance over to my Store Manager who has changed from an expression of watching, to an expression of what I can only describe as unfiltered rage. As I mentioned in my last post he is former military, did two tours while on active duty. This man has killed people and I'm beginning to fear I may see a live reenactment just from the amount of rage building next to me. He marches up to the front and steps in between my coworker and the soldier frothing at the mouth. His next words he speaks in that booming, loud but not yelling voice that you find in a lot of veterans. 


&gt;SM: What seems to be the problem here?


&gt;S: Your stupid employee over there can't do her job! All I want is an upgrade and she won't let me because my name isn't on the account? I PAY THE F#@KING BILL!!


&gt;SM: Well, according to the rules of the company, she is correct. She cannot let you into the account.


&gt;S: BULLS#*T!! I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE F#@#ING POLICIES!


&gt;SM: Just like you don't care about disrespecting that uniform you have on, [RANK]? 


Suddenly, the soldier is silent. And quite taken aback. I, meanwhile, am wishing I had popcorn because this is going to be the best entertainment I have all day! My store manager continues:


&gt;SM: You do understand what you represent when you put on that uniform, right? All the things that you represent, all the soldiers that have come before you, the soldiers you stand beside now. You're disrespecting all of them right now by acting the way you are while wearing that uniform. How would your Commanding Officer feel about your behavior. Actually, why don't we give him a call and ask him how he feels about your behavior? I'm sure he would love to hear all the things you just called my employee for trying to do her job. 


You ever see a child get scolded and they do that head drop? The head drop that says ""Ohhh no, I'm in deep trouble.""? It's one thing to see a kid do it, it's another thing to see a full grown man in BDUs suddenly take great interest in the pattern of the carpet. There is an awkward silence for what felt like a full minute before the soldier finally looks back up.


&gt;S: My deepest apologies, I'm sorry I let myself fly off the handle like that. You're right sir, I disrespected you all and I disrespected my uniform. What do I need to do to make this right?


Suddenly, all the tension in the air vanished. My Store Manager smiled, told the guy how to get made into an authorized user so he could come back later and get his upgrade, and next thing I know they're laughing and trading stories. My Store Manager even takes the guy's phone and cleans off some of the junk apps that were messing it up to help make it run smooth until he could get it upgraded. The soldier gave everyone another round of apologies, we thanked him for his service, and he left. My Store Manager went to the back for a few minutes, and came back out smiling even bigger. 


&gt;Me: Well, that was interesting experience.


&gt;SM: Yeah, not as interesting as the one he'll have later.


&gt;Me: What do you mean?


&gt;SM: I just got off the phone with his Commanding Officer, I'm guessing this wasn't the first time he's acted like a fool while in uniform. Needless to say, the CO was not happy. 


&gt;Me: But...everything was fine when he left, you two were smiling and joking. You even fixed...his...phone.


&gt;SM: Yep. Maybe next time he won't store his CO's phone number under the contact Commanding Officer. They didn't let that slide when I was in, I'm not gonna let it slide now. 


&gt;Me:...you're an evil genius you know that?


If I mislabeled anything or messed up any military related details, I do apologize. Just let me know in the comments and I'll fix them. ",TalesFromRetail,1528,1510323913
sparkleplentylikegma,If you stop working you die,"When I was 18 back in 2000 I worked at a large Home improvement store to get myself thru school. While there I met a man who worked in the tool section where you can get saw blades, small power tools etc. 

He only worked about 10-15 hrs a week mostly socking shelves of the smaller items. 

You could tell he was older but I wasn’t sure exactly how much older. Turns out the man flew a plane on D-Day!!! I’m like wait a minute... D day? How old is this guy?? Turns out he was 80. 

My 18 year old self was kind of stunned. So I asked him why he was still working even tho he was 80 and past retirement. He said something that I’ll never forget: 

“If you stop working, you die. Never stop working towards something.” 

TEN years later my husband saw him still there working in the tool section.

eighteenbubbles,"Yes, I'm completely hiding extra fees from you.","I work in a showroom that sells kitchen and bath products- faucets, toilets, sinks, all of that. Our showroom is large, but our stockroom is tiny, so most things are special ordered (which is fairly common in showrooms). We carry the basics, such as the valves you need and the most popular items, but the rest gets ordered. Normally not a problem, and shipping usually only takes a week. Most people expect a freight charge and we give them a warning about it. Because things are special ordered, we rarely allow returns (we will if you are nice or if we know we can easily resell). This is stated on quotes and on order confirmations, as well as your final receipt. 

A woman comes in and orders a few showers and faucets for her remodel. I write her up, explain that freight will be automatically added to her bill when the invoice arrives -which was also included on the original quote I emailed her a few days before she ordered-, and write down an estimate for her on her order confirmation. High end would be $15, so I put $15. Her order comes in, and yay, the freight charge is only $11. She comes in to get her order. I show her everything, she approves, we sit down to do the final payment. She's going to be SL, for stupid lady. 

&gt;SL: ""What is this $11 charge?""

&gt;Me: ""Oh, that is the freight charge we discussed. Good news is that it is actually lower than I originally told you.""

&gt;SL: ""We never discussed a freight charge.""

&gt;Me: ""We did, ma'am. I wrote it on your confirmation and the estimate was included on your original quote under 'freight charges'.""

&gt;SL: ""No, it was not. I'm not going to pay surprise fees.""

&gt;Me: ""It is a freight charge, ma'am. We had to order these from the manufacturer, which means they had to ship them. It was included in your quote and a note was added to your order confirmation.""

&gt;SL: ""I've already given your company thousands of dollars. I shouldn't have to pay a cent more!""

&gt;Me: ""Ma'am, our company does not keep the freight charges. It is paid to the manufacturer to cover their costs for shipping the product to you.""

&gt;SL: ""I'm not going to pay it.""

&gt;Me: ""If you don't pay for the items completely, you cannot take your order, ma'am. Payment has to be made in full.""

&gt;SL: ""Then I want a refund!"" 

&gt;Me: ""You can get a refund, but you will be charged a 30% restocking free by the manufacturer themselves.""

&gt;SL: ""Are you refusing to give me my money back?""

&gt;Me: ""The manufacturer sets the restocking fees. I can give you 70% of your money back, but 30% of the total order is a restocking fee."" 

&gt;SL: ""This can't be legal! You can't get away with all of these extra fees!"" 

I pull up the email I had sent her with her original quote and point to it: 

&gt;Me: ""The estimated freight charge in this quote is $15. It ended up only being $11, which actually saves you 4 dollars in the end. On this quote, you will see that it specifies that *if* a return is accepted, it is subject to the manufacturer's restocking fee. This brands fee is 30%. If you have your confirmation paperwork with you, you will see my note about the freight charge and a warning about returns that is automatically printed on the paper. I can give you back 70%"" -which was about $2100-  ""but the freight charge itself will be a part of the money that isn't given back to you.""

&gt;SL: ""Fine.""

&gt;Me: ""Are we going to be doing the refund or the final payment?""

&gt;SL: ""The final payment.""

I run her card, get her paperwork and signature and help her get her things to her car. As she is getting ready to get in her car:

&gt;SL: ""You know, to customers who spend a lot of money here, you should not charge them extra fees. It's rude and it's bad customer service.""

&gt;Me: ""Have a nice day, ma'am.""

It's $11. That you knew you would be paying. What the hell, lady.

IceWarm1980,You Towed Our Car While We Were Shopping(Spoiler...They Were Not Even In The Store),"I used to work at a grocery store in a ski town. Our store was about a block off the main street. People would often park in our parking lot, walk to the main street and take a bus to the ski area.

&amp;nbsp;

We would get our main deliveries on Tuesday and Friday. In order to get the semi trucks into the loading dock we had to block off a small portion of the parking lot. This is the middle of ski season and the truck is late so I am asked to watch the parking lot and make sure people are not parking where they shouldn't be. A large SUV pulls up. Somebody gets out, proceeds to move the cones and then tries to park. I tell them we are waiting for a delivery and if they could move their car out of the coned off area. They literally moved their car one space and it was still in the coned off area. I then see them leaving with all their ski gear. I walk back across the parking lot to ask them to move it again but they are too far away from the store by this point.

&amp;nbsp;

The delivery eventually arrives and we are forced to tow the car because the semi truck can't get in now. Tow company arrives and takes away the car. We get the delivery parked and unloaded. About an hour later we get a phone call asking for ""Mike."" We have a couple employees named Mike so I ask which Mike they are looking for. The guy then screams ""THE MIKE WHO TOWED OUR CAR!"" I tell them I am going to find somebody to address their call. They speak to a manager and then come into the store still in their ski gear. They tell the manager they were towed while they were in the store shopping despite being caught red handed due to their ski gear. They then decide to call the police. The police show up and basically tell them there is nothing they can do. They also mention the ski gear to the family. The police say the only thing they can do is to give them a ride to the tow company lot to get their car. The family claimed we had an arrangement with the tow company. We never had an arrangement with them and we only towed when it was a last resort.

sassafrasarai,The RCL.,"Ah, the RCL. A tale as old as time - okay, more like a month. Who or what is the RCL, you may be asking yourself. None other than the Rotisserie Chicken Lady.

Allow me to set the scene. It was around 9pm, after completing my cashier shift at a large Canadian grocery store. 17 year old me was waiting in the front lobby, minding her own business and waiting for my ride home. All of a sudden, to my right I hear a chair scraping against the floor as a very large woman stands up and throws, no, she *whips* her jacket at some poor, unassuming man seated in our eating area. 

RCL: ""DON'T F****** BOTHER COMING OVER TONIGHT. AND KEEP THIS F****** JACKET TOO.""

At this point I had no clue if she knew this man or not. Judging from his wide open mouth and confused stare, I would say he was as bewildered as I. He hurriedly gathered his things and, leaving the jacket on the ground, leaves the store. And who can blame him? By this time I am wildly uncomfortable and silently cursing whoever the hell was taking so long to pick me up. But hey, at least I had managed to avoid the wrath of RCL

That didn't last long. It was at this moment RCL earned her name.  I realized that in front of her were not one, not two, but *three* deli prepared rotisserie chickens. All three of these chickens had been ripped open and had random pieces missing. Yup, you guessed it, this woman alone had been eating three rotisserie chickens with her *bare hands* 

I guess she noticed what I had thought been my very subtle observation. Once again she stood up.

RCL: ""WHAT IN THE F*** DO YOU THINK YOU'RE LOOKING AT???""

Me: ""Um... nothing i'm just waiting for my ride home.""

RCL: ""Waiting for your ride home. YEAH F****** RIGHT."" (why the hell would I lie about that???)

I had no reply to that but finally, *finally* my sister pulls up. I scrambled to make my exit, but not before the RCL could get one last word in.

RCL: ""WELL F*** YOU. F*** YOUR PREJUDICED STORE. I AIN'T NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN.""

Such an empty promise, RCL. Not a week later she returned to purchase two more of our chickens. Luckily she saved the verbal harassment this time.

Sunday morning comes around and I️ get there at 9 to start counting. All is well no one pulling on my door which does happen but they soon realize we aren’t open. They normally will look at the hours, which is clearly visible on my door, and then walk off.  

10:00 am rolls around and someone pulls on the door, it’s loud so I️ look up and watch them read the hours then step back.

AlphaPrinceND,But I wanted THIS card out of my randomized booster! I want a refund!,"Mobile formatting.

This didn’t happen to me, but it happened to one of the guys I go to a Pokémon TCG league with.

My friend works for a TCG store that sells various amount of trading cards. Pokemon, Magic, DBZ, and...Yu-Gi-Oh (Gag). For those of you who don’t know about how Trading card games work, with most games, you usually buy a starter box that has a set list of cards in them, and if you want more, you can buy little packages of cards that have 10-15 random cards that you don’t get to see until you buy the cards, and you are almost always guaranteed a “Rare Card” in most packs and if you’re lucky, your rare will be a VERY rare card instead.

Anyways, it was a regular day, he was organizing the boxes and I was just off to the side, trying to decide what boosters from a set of a certain tcg expansion that I wanted to get for my girlfriend and some 15-year old kid walks in, and asks for a single Yu-Gi-Oh booster. My friend says sure, and gets him the pack. When he turns around, the guy has $4 on the table, which isn’t enough because of sales tax. When my friend points this out, the kid starts wining that “Tax is dumb” and that “he shouldn’t have to pay it because it’s HIS money.” Whatever, I just paid the tax out of my pocket to shut him up. The kid takes his pack and opens it, and after going through the pack, the kid starts SCREAMING his head off, and walks up to my friend. He slams the cards onto the table and DEMANDS a refund because he didn’t get the ultra rare (or whatever the really rare cards in YGO are called) that he SPECIFICALLY wanted. After my friend said he couldn’t do that, he started screaming and kicking over shelves. Me and my friend had to restrain him together to get him out of the store. And people wonder why I hate Yu-Gi-Oh so much.

TLDR; spoiled kid opens pack expecting a card he wanted, didn’t get it, and started crying about not getting a refund.

And people wonder why I hate the Yu-Gi-Oh fanbase.",TalesFromRetail,2015,1510004460
wezzer,'My new little booties',"Hey all, 

back again with another tale from a tile store. 

This occurred a few nights ago. I was working late. A customer comes in and I offer her assistance. She turns to me with delight, strikes a pose like she's singin' in  the rain and says:

**'do you like my new little booties?!'.** 

I look at the boots she's currently flourishing in my direction and politely agree that they are indeed very nice 'booties'.

She informs me that she hasn't measured her kitchen but she needs tiles desperately so she went ahead and measured it in steps. Her kitchen is and I quote:


 **'12 little booties that way, and 13 little booties this way'.**

I inform her that this is not an accurate way of measuring and so any quote I give her may be wrong. She insists on buying the tiles regardless.

I put through the sale.

She tells me that she won't take these tiles now but she does need to take two boxes of a different tile as there is a tiler waiting to finish a job for her. 

We find the tile. I process the sale.

I ask her:

  **'Would you like to take these two boxes with you now?'**


She responds: 

**'Oh, yes please!'**

I place the tiles on a trolley and we exit the store together. She heads off and I follow her. The trolley sounds like rolling thunder.

She leads me past our neighboring store, then past its neighboring store.... and she keeps going. 

We do a full lap of the entire retail park. She ambles towards a car then suddenly veers off. We're now back outside my store. She makes a sudden turn and heads towards the exit of the retail park. I'm thinking perhaps someone is picking her and the tiles up. 

She climbs the curb and is clearly leaving the park at this point.

I speak up: 

**'Sorry ma'am, where are we going with these tiles?'**

She turns, surprised, and says: 

**'I didn't know you where there!'**

I respond: 

**You said you wanted the tiles now, I've been following you around the entire park?**

**'Oh... well I'm walking home, I need to break in my new booties'.**

We don't sell those individually--they come in clear plastic boxes, usually in sets of six or twelve.  I was a bit confused about what to do with the cookies.

Here is our conversation (I'm ME, and the customer will be C)

&gt;C ""Oh, those are the free sample.""

&gt;Me ""The free sample?""

&gt;C ""Yes. The free sample.  I am diabetic and cannot eat a bunch of sugar at once, so I am taking some home for later.""

All I did was nod and smile. I didn't want to cause a scene, and since the customer had already bagged up the cookies, it wasn't like we could return them to the free sample container.  But, I'm pretty sure you aren't supposed to eat a bunch of the free sample--just one.  And, if you like it, then you can BUY more to take home and have for later.  At least, I think that's how it works....",TalesFromRetail,2746,1509939717
blame_darwin,Diamond Steve,"Ye old and several years ago, I worked at a popular video game retail store. I was there for a few years and experienced much in my time, but this is a story I like.

On a day I don't remember anything else about, while the store was pretty slow, a lady and her son came in. They weren't looking for anything particular that I can recall, but after browsing they came to the counter with a Minecraft mystery bag toy thing. For about 5 bucks, you can get a Minecraft figure that you probably don't want. Personally, I bought like 4 before I got the damned skeleton.

I ring them up, and ask the kid what he thought he got, because the guessing game was my favorite when it came to these mysterious collectables. He informs me that he's hoping to get diamond Steve. I playfully scoff, tell him Skelly guy or bust. Probably. I honestly don't remember. 

After the monies are exchanged, he opens the bag and is disappointed in whatever Not Diamond Steve that he got. I know that pain, kiddo. I ask if they come around here often, to which the lady replies that she does. Cool. I hit them with a ""I'll bring up my diamond Steve tomorrow, and the next time you're here just let whoever know that there's a Steve for you in the cabinet."" 

They replied with a ""are you sure?"" Yeah, man. He was like the first thing I got, I don't even want him. Skelly or bust.

So Steve was transferred from a place of low honor on my nerd shelf to the hold cabinet at work on my next shift, with instructions for his release to the lady and her kid. Soon after, he was collected. I wasn't scheduled til later in the day, so I wasn't there when the lady came by to get Diamond Steve, but apparently she was wicked appreciative of my valiant sacrifice and had left me a crisp 5 dollar bill. My co-worked had tried to refuse this, knowing I would want them to, but she insisted.

It was an insanely kind gesture on her part. And it made my day. ",TalesFromRetail,648,1509937966

So I no longer work retail (thank jeebus) but I spent many years working all different positions at a large arts&amp;crafts store. And oh boy do i have some stories from those days. Well when I first started I was a cashier,  and my boss always scheduled me for morning shifts when it was slow enough to only have one cashier (because I was also fast enough to keep the line down if there was a random early morning rush). So one slow morning, I'm stocking shelves near the front when this lady comes up to me. Before  I could even say anything, she lays in to me. ""I'm going to tell you what I want, but before I do so, I don't want you to tell me where it is, I want you to go get it for me. You understand? Every time somebody gives me directions in this store they're wrong,  so i spend 20 minutes searching and I'm in a hurry!""  Then she tells me what she wants. I was like ""ok, let me call somebody up to walk you to the item. "" her: ""no! Go get it for me!"" Me: ""well I'm the only cashier on shift right now, so I can't walk that far away from my register. Let me just call somebody..."" her: ""NO. I said go get it for me!!!""

I legitimately don't remember how I resolved it, but she finally walked away. She may have just left. Who cares. I do remember my next customer who had heard the entire thing,  and came up to my register telling me to ""Go fetch!"" Which made my day a bit better.

Seriously though? It's been like 5 years and I still can't believe that lady 😂",TalesFromRetail,650,1509915073
desultorysock,"In the middle of a snowstorm, people seem surprised by snow.","I work in an automotive shop, and my boyfriend works in an automotive parts store. Between both of us, we're having LOTS of fun this week...

We live in Canada. After or on Halloween, it infamously begins to snow here. Just as due, Novemeber 1st, it began snowing. *And it hasn't stopped*. It snowed a little on the 1st. It snowed a little on the 2nd. And we got a snowstorm on the 3rd, which, as I type this, is still going, but with slightly less brutality. All in all, everything is buried under a blanket of white, about a foot deep.

When it first started, it was slippery; it was that kinda rainy, mostly snowy sort, which just creates ice. Now it's about -5 Celsius outside, and it's definitely fluffy, pure snow. Given that we're both in the automotive field, this means usually one thing - *tire season*!

While my poor boyfriend is talking to customers mostly looking to buy cheap tires, and a few have asked to have them installed in their meek oil change and tire repair shop yesterday, my shop is bigger. It's been nothing but people asking to put tires on, but we have engine jobs and tow ins to go through, and our tires are booked almost a week ahead of time at the moment.

""Any chance you can put them on today or tomorrow?"" they'll ask. No.

""Can you let me know if there's a cancellation?"" they'll try next. Sure, but there's five people ahead of you, at least.

""Can you do them quick? I have somewhere to be."" I'll give you that this is more valid; but we have tires coming out our asses and only one tire machine. We can only work so fast.

If any of you are putting tires on your vehicles this season, please be patient with us!! Everybody wants their tires installed, so if you know you'll be pressed for time, call ahead, or book early! I had my own winter tires installed three weeks ago. Tire season is super stressful, please don't be last minute planners!

And again... I live in Canada. Snow is not anything new here, in a couple months we'll probably be buried under four feet of this crap. It happens every year, folks, so be prepared!

mstersunderthebed,"""I lost this, can I have a refund?""","Hey all, I work in a college bookstore as the front end manager and this just happened to me. 

I'm pretty much at the front of the store every day, as I'm the one who's in charge of the registers, ordering product, etc. Because of this, I often am the one checking customers out, and helping them find product. Yesterday, I had a gentleman come in who wanted headphones. He kept picking up expensive pairs and then being surprised when they rang up as expensive. I finally point him to our least expensive headphones (around 10 bucks) and send him on his merry way after assuring him that yes, the wires would be long enough to reach from his pocket to his ears. 

He comes back in today and asks if I remember him. I cheerily say ""Sure! You got headphones!"" He pulls out his receipt and tells me that he lost them (in the span of 24 hours) and said ""Can you do anything about this?""

I will be Me, he with be C

Me: What do you mean?

C: I lost them, but I have the receipt.

Me: Well, that's great, but I can't do anything if you don't have the original product.
 
C: *Stares blankly*

Me: You see, in order to give you a refund or a new pair of headphones, I need the pair I sold you yesterday.

C: Do you have an old pair that I can have?

Me: *Stares blankly* Um...no.....we only carry new headphones. I'm sorry, but I can't do anything for you.

So, he goes off and grabs another pair of 10 dollar headphones, slams his campus card on the counter and leaves in what can only be described as a huff.

Saiomi,"""I have a coupon. That means it's free.""","I worked in a large grocery store for about 4 years. You find some real smart cookies when you work with the public for that long.

This happened while I was supervising the self check outs. It was later in the evening and the store was slow. This woman walks up to one of my machines and scans in her one item. She has a coupon so she flags me down to help her with it. I come over and get her coupon. I was for $2.50 off of her item. Her item was $2.50 but there is such a thing as taxes that she had to pay.

So I ring her up and her total is like $0.12 or something. She looks at the screen and back at me. I smile and ask if she needs anything else. ""Why does it say I owe money? The item was $2.50 and I had that coupon."" 

For the record, when you hit ""pay for my order"" it shows you a break down of the transaction and what you're paying for. The screen showed:

Purchace: $2.50

Coupons: -$2.50

Taxes: $0.12

So I explain that even though it took off the retail price, we were still selling an item and the sales taxes must be paid. ""But my coupon was $2.50 and the item is $2.50.""

She was so hard headed that I had to call my supervisor over to have her explain the exact same thing to the woman who still didn't get it. I had to bite my lip so hard to keep my outbursts inside.

Cervidantidus,"""It should still cost less. I don't get it. It should cost less.""","Lady comes up as I'm helping her husband and starts whining to him about prices, exclaiming that there's ""no reason"" for them to be the way they are.

I ask what the problem is because I like correcting people.

She says that she's upset because chicken wings are always the most expensive part of the chicken, ""even though they have the least meat on them"".

I explain to her.

""That's why they're the most expensive. It costs more money to make chicken wings than it does to make breasts. It takes one chicken to make two wings, and one chicken to make two breasts, but there's easily 4-5x as much meat (probably more) in a breast than in a wing. To get the same amount of meat as two chicken breasts, you need to raise 6+ chickens. So one package of chicken breasts cost way less to make than one package of chicken wings.""

&gt;That makes no sense.

""Let me make it easier. If it costs 10 dollars to raise a chicken, that means it costs 10 dollars to make a package of two chicken breasts. How many wings come in a package? 10 or more. So that means it requires 5 or more chickens to make a package of chicken wings, meaning it costs 50 dollars versus 10 dollars for the breasts. It costs more to make, so it costs more to sell, so it costs more to buy.""

&gt;That makes no sense. There's less meat so it should cost less.

""I don't know how to explain it any simpler.""

Inb4 long af

I'm am assistant manager at a college bookstore and most of the people we deal with are pretty nice here. 
It's one of those ""when it's good its really good, when it's bad it's reaaalll bad.""

I've worked in customer service jobs since I was 15, and this lady was the worst I've dealt with. Ever. 

Some pertinent info: we have a 14 day period called ""rush"" when all the kids are coming in for textbooks and starting classes in Sept. This is a non-stop chaos filled, 10 hour days sh*tshow. Its stressful and exhausting. 
We give the students until the end of add/drop to return books for a full refund with receipt. This is a week after the first day of classes, which is pretty fair.

Now for the story. We open at 9am, I'm opening alone. My manager has an appt and the employee opening with me called in. Nbd, right after our rush period, we had a day off for Labor day and I was feeling refreshed after working 15 days in a row and being yelled at by parents dropping hundreds on their kids education. 

I have a short line of customers and the phone rings.

Most questions are easy and can be answered in less than a minute, so I ask the customer at my till if she minds if I answer as I check her out. She says go ahead. I'm scanning the girl at the counters items and I answer the phone call: I'll be ""M"" , she'll be ""SB -screaming biotch""

M - schpeil : good morning this is bookstore, wakeupyoureyes speaking how can I help you?

SB - I'd like to speak to a manager.

M - I'm a manager ma'am, what can I help you with?

SB - you were closed yesterday and I've been trying to get ahold of someone! I already know the answer to this and I saw on your website that you don't give full refunds after the first week of classes, I find that ridiculous. How were we supposed to know if you don't tell us?! (Didn't you just read that on the website, crazy? That's telling you.) But I want a refund for an access code my son bought that he JUST told me this weekend we can get cheaper on this website.

M - I'm sorry ma'am, yes we were closed for the holiday yesterday. Corporate closes all our stores. I wish I could help you, but as you correctly started our last day for full refunded returns was this past friday. We...

SB - THAT IS FCKING RIDICULOUS I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU WON'T GIVE ME A REFUND YOU WERE CLOSED I COULDN'T EVEN GET IN TO RETURN THE FCKING THING THAT'S NOT MY FAULT YOU WERE CLOSED WHAT KIND OF FCKING CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THIS? YOU WERE CLOSED.

M - yes ma'am, we closed for the holiday per corporate. We give...

SB- I WANT TO SPEAK TO ANOTHER MANAGER. 

magic words.  Usually I would hand the phone off in a heartbeat. But my manager was out. 

M - I'm sorry ma'am, the store manager is out for the morning, I can take your name and number and have him call you when he gets in.

SB - NO I DON'T WANT HIM TO FCKING CALL ME I WANT TO TALK TO HIM (wut..) WHEN IS HE GOING TO BE IN? THIS IS FCKING RIDICULOUS. YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS RETURN, I SPENT 100 FCKING DOLLARS ON THIS. THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO? 

M - I'm sorry ma'am.. he'll be in around noon, or you can call tomorrow morning. Thats his decision if.... 

SB- NO YOU'RE FUCKING NOT! WHAT'S YOUR NAME THIS IS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

M - my name is wakeupyoureyes

SB - WELL, WAKEUPYOUREYES YOU'RE A FCKING AS$HOLE! 

M - I'm sorry ma'am but I don't appreciate the way you're speaking to me so I'm going to have to let you go. 

I hung up, shaken. In all my years in customer service I've never been cussed at. The college students waiting in line heard the whole thing and kept checking if I was okay. 

My manager came in, I told him the situation. He was furious she spoke to me like that and told me I was correct on our return policy and sometimes we could make exceptions, but not for customers verbally attacking our staff.

What followed was the most ridiculous chain of events I've ever seen in retail history. Emails, corporate, she works at another local college. This lady was 1000 kinds of whackadoodle. 

Oh wow I didn't think you guys would want to hear more! I have so many good ones I can't wait to post now, but heres the creamy middle of this whackadoo cookie sandwich. 

So my manager is livid, he goes to our campus client to let them know a parent acted like this. 

Meanwhile, SB is spamming our inbox with her anger. Message after unfinished message. Heres some highlights of her bashing me:

 ""xwakeupyoureyes completely disregarded customer satisfaction."" ""Was not compassionate and willing to help by coming up with a solution that would have been acceptable to both parties"" and the cliche ""I will not be giving you my business in the future"" 

K. First off, you came in hot, angry AND cussed me out. Wouldn't let me finish a sentence, you are past help here honey. But you do you in crazy land. 

I figured she got it all out of her system, told my boss, we had a good laugh cause what a nutbag.

He sent her the obligatory email back with ""I was disappointed to hear of the conversation that took place this morning and the vocabulary/language used"" 

I was floored, a boss sticking up for me?! Yess retail win!

Nothing from SB for the rest of the day.  We googled her name amd email to see what we were dealing with, turns out she worked at ANOTHER LOCAL COLLEGE SO THIS WHACKADO WAS VERBALLY ACCOSTING ME AND SENDING HATE MAIL  WHILE SHE WAS AT WORK IN A SIMILAR ENVIRONMENT. HOOKAAY. I'm peeved, but whatever. Let it slide off your back, blah blah.

Next day, nothing in the inbox. Cool maybe she realized she was being a grade A psycho and chilled out.

LOL. NO.

Phone rings.

M - Good morning, bookstore how can I help you.

SB - I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER

M - I'm a manager, what can I help you with? 

SB - ....WHAT'S YOUR NAME

M - xwakeupyoureyes

SB - NOT YOU I WANT THE OTHER MANAGER

M - alright ma'am, no problem. 


Mute. Hand the phone to my boss and tell him good luck as I pick up the other line to listen in. 

You think the conversation I had with her was nuts? 
It just gets better. 

Unfortunately I would love to give you a great ending of validation for the ever abused retail worker, but alas this story didn't end that way.

So I'm listening to SB start in on my manager, same angry ""give me what I want, I'm the customer"" attitude. She talks over him voicing that she is entitled to a refund, blah blah. Then it gets good. GM is my manager. 

GM - well ma'am, normally I can make exceptions on things for customer accommodation, but the only thing that's stopping me is the way you spoke to xwakeupyoureyes. 

SB - well I guess I shouldn't have sworn at her, but haven't you ever gotten angry and yelled at someone? Everyone swears at people when they get angry. She wasn't helping me so I was angry. I had every right to be! 

GM - ...uh no ma'am, I haven't ever sworn at anyone in a business or consumer setting. 

SB - I'm sure you have. I don't think customer service is where your ASM should be. You should train your employees better. Regardless, are you going to give me a refund? 

GM - I'll be sure to go over customer service with my ASM again. I'll think about it and get back to you. 

DID THIS LADY JUST DEFEND HER CUSSING ME OUT. OH HELL NO DID MY MANAGER JUST SAY HE WOULD CONSIDER A REFUND. 

Cool.

I ask him if he's going to cave to her after everything, he says probably to get her to go away. 
Pissed cannot even cover what I'm feeling. She gets to act like an entitled child who learned some bad words and get what she wants still? 

Aren't you supposed to not reward bad behavior? 

He emails her back that he will give her the refund on the condition that her son brings back the access code, not her. 

He refunds her, I'm a sad boi.

She then leaves a 1 star review on our Facebook page conveniently leaving out that she cussed me out, but stating she received poor service. 

Thumbs up.

FUCKAFISH,Can somebody help me?! Hello!,"I work in a busy grocery store so I spend a lot of time helping customers. We are supposed to greet every single customer and offer to find them anything so I am nothing short of helpful. 

In this situation, it was getting late and my aisle was empty. Suddenly I hear a woman practically screaming from 2 aisles over: 

""CAN ANYBODY HELP ME?! HELLO"" 

I immediately looked for her and ran to the aisle she was on because I thought she had gotten injured or something. She was an eccentric elderly lady wearing what I assume was a nightgown and spoke in a very exasperated tone.

Woman: Can you help me, I have bed bugs!  I don't know what to do please help. 

Me: Yes ma'am all of our bed bug products are right here. 

We were standing right in front of our insect repellent section so I gesture at the 2 products that say bed bugs on them. There was a moment of awkwardness where nothing happens as I was still recovering from thinking this lady had a heart attack earlier. This is usually the part the customer thanks me for helping them and I leave.  

Women: Well are you going to help me!?

Me: Yes ma'am this right here (I point directly at the product) is supposed to be for bed bugs

Woman: Well does it kill them, I need to get rid of them!

Me: I don't know ma'am, I don't know much about these types of products 

Woman: Are you going to help me or not!?

At this point I end up admitting that these will indeed kill her bed bugs and I even googled how to kill bed bugs on my phone. I figured I would go the extra mile to get the lady to not come back and complain about me. I showed he where the borax was and she stormed off without saying anything to me.

I'd spent quite a while arranging the window display, and had put some nice looking socks right in the centre.  
  
A couple hours went by, and a young woman who had been walking past took a look at our front display, and came storming in.

LOTRspartan,"""Ma'am I suggest you call the police""","So I had just stumbled upon this subreddit and realized this was the perfect place for me to tell all my strange tales of putting up with customers. This story happened on my second day of work of my very first job (still working there.) Now my store closes up at 10:00 pm and I usually work from 5:00 pm to close. 

On this particular day, it was nearing 9:30 when the phone rang. Being an introvert, I do not like talking on phones and have anxiety from picking them up, but realizing my coworker was busy ringing someone else, I had to man up and pick up the phone. Some important info to know is that my store is a nation wide brand and we offer little keyring cards to get special offers and what not. So the following conversation happens when I pick up the phone. 

""Hello this is (store name). I'm (insert my name) how can I help you?""
 
Now I could kind of tell something was wrong when this person called. She seemed already kind of aggravated and paranoid. 

""Yes, hi. I found one of your keychains at my house on a set of keys that don't belong to me. Can you see who it belongs to?""

""I'm sorry could you repeat that?""

""I found YOUR store's card and I want to know who it belongs to. It's not mine.""

""Um I'm sorry ma'am but it's against store policy to give you someone's personal information especially via phone."" 

Now she started to get aggravated with me. ""Listen. I found these keys in my house and they don't belong to me! I'm afraid to enter my house with my daughters. Someone was in my house! I want to know their name!""

""Ma'am I can't give it to you...Maybe you should call the police for this matter if you think someone broke into your house...""

""I don't want to waste the police's time if this will get me nowhere! I'm terrified to enter my house!"" 

""Ma'am, this is what the police's job is for-""

She then abruptly cut me off and asked for my manager. I gave my manager the phone and she basically repeated the same thing I did. Eventually my manager hung up the phone encouraging her to call the police and said that's all she could do. To this day I have no idea if someone did break into her house or if she called the police. My personal theory is that her husband may have had a little affair and the mistress left her keys behind and the wife wanted the name as proof to the affair, although I guess I'll never know.

Knever,"""I can see it, so it's for sale!""","Another tale from the game store. This one happened just a couple of days ago, when Wolfenstein II came out.

My shift is in the afternoon, so while it's a bit later in the day, it's still a little busy since two other popular games came out (Super Mario Odyssey and Assassin's Creed: Origins) so I don't take much notice of the back counter (aside from it being a jumbled mess with a bunch of stuff scattered about).

I check people out as normal, pretty much everyone getting one of the three games. A woman comes up and beams when she sees something behind the counter. She asks to buy the Wolfenstein Collector's Edition (pretty big box; not sure how I missed it earlier). I had known previously that we had only gotten enough of them to fulfill preorders, and didn't get any extras. And I also happened to know exactly who had ordered this one (Xbox One version) because I was the one who made the order for her.

At first glance, I thought maybe she had cancelled the reserve. But I look in the computer and it's still there. I ask my coworker if the customer had called in and said she didn't want it anymore, but that didn't appear to be the case. I turned to break the news to the lady in front of me.

&gt;Me: I'm sorry, ma'am, but this game is reserved for someone who already paid for it.

&gt;Her: What do you mean? It's right there.

&gt;Me: I know, it actually shouldn't be up there, but the fact remains that I can't sell it to anybody, since someone else has already purchased it.

&gt;Her: That doesn't make sense. Why is it here if someone already bought it? If I can see it, it's for sale! I just want to buy it!

&gt;Me: I'm really sorry, ma'am, but the best I can do for you is to see if any other stores in the area may have one available.

&gt;Her: That's unacceptable! I got here first! It should be sold to me!

&gt;Me: Actually, *she* paid for it months ago.

The customer that had the reserve had just walked in, and was a little puzzled as to why I had indicated towards her. Let's call her Ren.

&gt;Ren: Oooh, Wolfenstein, you're comin' home with me today!

She walked up to my coworker who was available at the time, but the woman interjected.

I try to explain the reserve again, but she doesn't listen to me; she's focused on Ren now.

&gt;Ren: What? Uh, sorry, lady, but I reserved the game a few months back. You guys don't have any extra?

I shrug.

&gt;Ren: Sorry, then. I've been waiting for this game for a long time.

The woman looks like she's about to go off, but she restrains herself and simply stomps her feet and leaves.

In all honesty, whoever had put the game on the counter had made a mistake (as it implies it is indeed for sale) but it doesn't negate the fact that someone else had already paid for it.",TalesFromRetail,2593,1509309482
QuitSplash,I will never forget this customer,"I think one thing we all agree on is how much working in retail sucks. But sometimes you get a customer that almost makes up for it.

I was working the customer service desk in a well known electronic store chain in the UK when this lady came up to me. I'd served her before and she bought back a tablet I had recently sold her (Oh god, whats wrong with it)

Turns out she had accidentally knocked it off the table whilst it was charging, internal pins were completely bent and damaged, the tablet at like 5% battery. Her husband had recently died and their conversation chat log was on this tablet, she started telling me the story, clearly fighting back the tears and getting more and more upset and angry with herself.

I talked to her to try and calm her down and told her I would do everything I could. I managed to bend the pins back and get the tablet charging but it was a temporary fix, the pins were very badly damaged.

I told her I was going to transfer the chat log to an SD card along with her pictures but I couldn't promise it would work or be done in time before the tablet was dead. She said she would pay whatever she needs to get it done.

An hour later (with stares from my manager for spending so long with one person), we managed to get it all transferred over. I've never seen someone ugly happy cry before but she full on broke down, hugging me, asking me to marry her (she was about 60, so jokingly) gave me a kiss on the cheek, spoke to my manager and then left.

I must admit, I was almost tearing up at one point too. A few days later she came back and bought me cake, gave me a hug and thanked me again. 

I left the store a couple of days later for a new job, I still think about her sometimes, lovely woman. ",TalesFromRetail,770,1509276674
RubberReptile,Today I Made a Customer Cry,"I work in photo finishing and I was helping a friendly lady who wanted prints off of her phone. She off-handedly mentioned that she recently lost all the photos on her phone so she was only able to get prints from the last few weeks.


I found it odd that the photos would just disappear but the phone was still working. She insisted, despite being a ""technology illiterate"" that she didn't accidentally delete them. She also off-handedly mentioned that she thought her phone had a memory card in it. 


This needed further investigation. I fully expected her to not have a micro SD card, since many older folk call the Sim Card a memory card, but lo-and-behold there was one inside. 


I put the card into one computer and it didn't show up at all so I tried our Windows PC instead and it told me the disk was unformatted. Likely corrupted somehow by her cheap off-brand Android.


I didn't want to get the her hopes up, but since Windows was able to see it I thought there might be a chance... So I took a deep breath, formatted it and threw it into our recovery software.


I was able to recover 90% of the photos and video on that card.


The lady had been waiting for her prints anyway so I waved for her to come around to my computer and take a look. She looked at the photos on the screen and literally started bawling. It was all her most important pics - her grandson's grad, her dog that had passed a few months ago, family trips... Years worth of pics that weren't backed up anywhere. In the end she bought a new Micro SD and I gave her a DVD of the pics at no charge. After paying, she ran behind the counter and gave me a big hug. 


I later found out that she hand wrote my boss a letter and said it was the best customer service she'd ever had. 


Today has been a good day.",TalesFromRetail,8736,1509232867
SapphireBrienne,I’m tired of dirty reusable bags,"As I’ve mentioned before, I work at a well-known grocery store (and hate it). Just a few moments ago I had a woman interrupt the customer I was helping to tell me that she only brought one reusable bag and that it already had stuff in it but “everything should still fit”. When I begin her transaction, I open her bag to find a MESS. It was disgusting. The bottom of the bag was full of many things ranging from yarn to just plain garbage. The smell wasn’t pleasant either. 

Fast forward to the end of her transaction. She writes a check for $20 over. The check she hands me was crumpled and seems to have been wet as some point. With what? I don’t want to know. Because it’s so damaged, the check reader can’t process it. I try several times and by this point I have a line. I notice she’s getting frustrated and begin to suggest a different check when she cuts me off and asks if she has to write another. 

Long story short, the second (non-crumpled) check works. I tell her it was the previous check that was the issue to which she says nothing. ",TalesFromRetail,835,1509206393
CourageousCabbage,"""You're really lucky, kid. If we were anywhere else...""","I posted another story yesterday and this one got brought up in the comments, so here's the full tale.  M - Me, OM - Old Man, OW - Old Woman  

I work in a small hardware store and we offer a window screen repair/construction service. I've been doing it almost 2 years now and have a good reputation.  

An older couple came in, probably late sixties, and asked me to build them a window screen. No problem, except they wanted me to make it with aluminum screening. I've had no luck fitting a screen with aluminum because it breaks when you roll it into the grooves so I generally refuse to do it, and I told them this, but they insisted on it being made of aluminum so I agreed to give it a try with no guarantees. It would also be a week before I could get the material because someone recently bought the whole roll of that size. I took their info and told them to come in the day after we got the delivery.

So a week later they come into the store:

&gt;OM: Where's our screen. (Notice the lack of a question mark)  

&gt;M:I havent gotten to it yet sir, we're still putting away our delivery. I'll get started on it as soon as I can and I'll let you know tomorrow how it goes.  

&gt;OM: Well why not? It's been a week!  

&gt;M: Because we just got our delivery today and I havent finished stocking the store, I told you it wouldnt be ready until tomorrow.  

He and his wife huffed and, amazingly, left.  

I got around to working on it a couple hours later and quickly realized I was right, I wouldnt be able to make their screen. I even tried 3 times for them, wasting material. I ended up with an intact screen that had 4 or 5 small spots around the edge that were ripped. Aesthetically they'd never be noticed, but there is technically still a hole there.  

I called them and told them about the situation, they said they'd ""be there in a minute to fix the problem for me."" I knew immediately this was going to be an ordeal.  

They walk in the door and OM immediately starts yelling at the owner, who had nothing to do with it. I didnt make out what they were saying, I was on the other side of the store, but I knew exactly who it was. I walk up to them:  

&gt;M: Hey is everything okay?  

&gt;OM: My wife is saying you *points finger at me* called her saying you suck at your job and cant build our screen. WE'VE BEEN WAITING A WEEK!  

&gt;M: Okay sir, I'll do what I can to help you but you're gonna have to calm down some. When you dropped it off I told you I probably wasnt going to be able to do it, here's the best I could do for you.  

&gt;OW: It's your technique that's the problem. I watched a YouTube video about it this morning and did one myself earlier (note: they hadnt purchased any screening from us, we didnt even have it in stock, and we're one of the few places around that you can get this specific screen).  

Im pretty done with their attitudes at this point.  

&gt;M: (Politely, no snideness) Well since you seem to be more talented than I am, I'd be happy to tear this one down and sell you the empty frame so you can put it in yourself.  

&gt;OM: Oh, well hold on now *inspects screen and grudgingly asks how much for it*  

&gt;M: Well since it's not perfect I'll only charge you for the material used on the screen, no labor. (I just wanted them gone)  

&gt;OM: Fine. (Under his breath) fucking fool.  

This really irked me, which led to what is considered an ""explosion"" for me. Im extremely mild mannered.  

(At the checkout)
&gt;M: Your total is $$$.  

&gt;OM: Should be free.  

&gt;M: Well, it's not sir.  

&gt;OM: (getting super angry again) You got a lot of nerve, you know that?  

&gt;M: Oh yeah, definitely. You total is $$$, cash or card?  

&gt;OM: You're damn lucky, kid. If we were anywhere else right now...  

At this point I stopped the transaction and just looked at him for a couple seconds.  

&gt;M: Did you just threaten me?  

He shrugged and gave me a ""what can I say?"" kind of look so I voided the sale and broke his newly made screen right in front of him, them told them to leave.  

&gt;OM &amp; OW: Oh what the HELL?!  

&gt;M: Get out of my store.  

&gt;OW: You need to learn some respect!  

&gt;OM: Fuck this place and fuck you and fuck your business, fuck your attitude and FUCK YOUR FACE.  

I didnt reply but wanted so badly to say, ""Well fuck you too, AND that horse you rode in on!"" but, you know, responsible adult. I've never been threatened at work before and it kinda threw me off.  

The owner watched it all (he lets me handle any ""situations"" because Im very cool and collected while he has some temper problems) and after they left we had a good laugh about how I broke the screen. All in all we probably lost about $10 in materials so it was totally worth it. I love my boss.  

Edit: My stories seem to be quite entertaining so I definitely plan to post some more! I have a lot of interesting encounters, old people do the darndest things!",TalesFromRetail,2920,1509132301
CourageousCabbage,"""Dont you f*** with me boy, or we'll both have a really bad day.""","I work in a small hardware store, it's just me and the owner. A gentleman (pssh) came in yesterday and bought a couple pieces of stovepipe, but one of them had some light scratches on the outside (he knew about them, he made a big deal about it when he bought it). He comes in immediately hostile. M: Me D: Dude. 

M: (remembering him from yesterday) Hey, did one not work out for ya? 

D: It's all scratched up, this is fucking ridiculous. I want a clean one. 

M: I think they're all scratched sir (we looked at a bunch yesterday), but let's go see what we can find. 

D: Well maybe the manufacturer should get their fucking shit together. 

We walk over to the stovepipe and lo and behold, they all have slight scratches. They're not even that noticable, it kind of looks like dirty rain rolled down the sides and dried. Very faint.

I went through what we had out as well as another box, just to make sure they were all like that, but he still wasnt satisfied and began taking them ALL out on the floor. He was even bending them out of shape trying to get them apart without scratching them (turns out it didnt matter) and I was already pretty annoyed at this point so I snapped at him a little: 

M: Sir, stop, you're bending them out of shape. 

D: Im looking for one that's not scratched, dammit! 

M: Just take one and go or get a refund, they're all the same. 

At this point he stood up and kind of bowed up to me. 

D: Dont you fuck with me, boy, or we're both gonna have a really bad day. 

I grabbed his original piece and pushed it into his hands (not forcefully). 

M: Dont you threaten me, old man, or I'll make sure you have a really bad day with the police. Get out of my store, you're now trespassing. 

D: *pissed off* You fucking little shi- 

M: Get out and dont come back or Im calling the police. 

He slammed the door on his way out and I had to put away like 20 pieces of stovepipe he littered around the floor. I told the owner about it and what the guy looked like, he approved of my actions. 

I've never been threatened at work before and it's happened twice now this week. Is it a full moon or something? /s",TalesFromRetail,2632,1509056532
mtjacksn11,$3000 on the gift card,"FTP

I work at a taco joint with a fairly decent reputation. This story is a little about my stupidity as well as how awesome my manager is. 

It's kinda late and I'm going home in about an hour and a guy walks in who looks like he hasn't showered in a while.  

Strike one.  

I start to get a weird feeling in the back of my head and ignore it. I decide to get this over with. He orders enough tacos to feed an office party.  

Strike two.  

When he swipes what is clearly a gift card for the store it brings up an error in the system that I hadn't seen before.  

Strike three.  

Instead of calling his bluff and checking the amount on the gift card, I go and get my manager because I'm thick. Literally the first thing she does is ask the customer how much is on the card. His response:  

""Um, three thousand dollars?""  

At that point I finally realized he was full of it. Manager lets me take over while crushing this dude's hopes at free food by shouting to the back not to make the order.  

In the end the card only had 5 bucks. We got the guy a more reasonable order and sent him on his way.  

Thankfully he wasn't annoying about it and knew when he was beat. 

TL;DR bum lies about his gift card for free food and manager calls his bluff.

johnnydakota,That's not how that works,"I work in a certain niche retail store. There are several other stores around that sell the same products as us.

One day a woman came in with a product saying she had problems with it. I don't remember the conversation exactly but this is basically how it went:

*Exchange ""welcome"" pleasantries*

Woman: ""I bought this at so-and-so store and it's not working""

Me: ""That's too bad. What seems to be the issue with it?""

Woman: *explains problem*

Me: ""Ah, I see. Unfortunately, there's really not much you can do about that. I would take it back to so-and-so store and see if they can exchange it out for you.""

Woman: ""I went there and they wouldn't do anything that's why I came here. I was wondering if you could help me out and swap me.""

Me: ""Like... give you a new one?""

Woman: ""Yeah, you have them right there in the case so I just wanted to switch it out since this one's bad.""

Me: ""I understand and I'm sorry but unless you purchased it here, there's nothing we can really do as we aren't affiliated with that store. I'm happy to offer you a discount to help you out if you wanted to pick up a new one but that's about the best I can do.""

Woman: ""But you have them RIGHT THERE. I don't understand why I can't just trade you out.""

At this point, I'm just really baffled. I don't know if she really thinks that's how the world works or is just trying to act stupid to see if it will work. She eventually left defeated and I informed my staff about her just in case she decided to try it on someone else. She was distinguishable enough that I was able to describe her pretty well.

Sure enough, I was told she came in over the weekend. This time she said she bought the product at OUR store, thinking that would be enough to get one over on us. Didn't work as she obviously didn't have a receipt. 

When I was told about it, she apparently said she didn't understand why they couldn't exchange it even though she didn't have a receipt but kept claiming she bought it at our store and was met with the response ""We require a receipt because, believe it or not, there are terrible people who actually buy something somewhere else and then come here when the other store won't do anything for them to try to get a free product"". I guess she left shortly after hearing that.",TalesFromRetail,702,1508957121

Knever,"""My friend said you do repairs, so you have to do it.""","Hi again. Another story from the game store. This one was a while back and I just remembered. Some details may be off.

It's a fairly normal day when a woman and her son come in, the woman with a bag containing an Xbox 360.

I smile and say, ""Hi! Looking to trade in today?""

She shakes her head and says, ""No, it's not working.""

I expect her to continue, but she doesn't.

&gt; Me: Umm... okay. If you purchased it from us, we may be able to return it. Do you have the receipt?

&gt; Her: No, we got it somewhere else. I know I can't return it but I would like you to fix it, please.

&gt;Me: Oh, I'm sorry; we actually don't do repairs. Depending on the issue, we may still be able to tra-

&gt;Her: What do you mean, ""You don't do repairs""? Yes, you do!

&gt;Me: I'm sorry, ma'am, but we do not do repairs.

Her son jumps in.

&gt;Kid: Yeah-huh! My friend said!

&gt;Her: See? His friend said you do repairs.

I'm honestly at a loss for words. Like, the kid's friend saying something magically makes it so?

&gt;Me: I'm sorry, maybe there was a miscommunication. We do have a repair center that-

&gt;Her: I knew it! Why did you say you don't do repairs if you have a repair center?!

&gt;Me: Ma'am, you didn't let me finish. Please.

Surprisingly, she waits.

&gt;Me: We have a repair center where we send defective products in the hopes that they can be repaired, and, if so, they are sent out to stores on an as-needed basis. It's not a service that offer to customers, however. Perhaps the friend misunderstood if he heard about that.

&gt;Her: Well, I don't care about that. You have a repair center, so you can repair it.

&gt;Me: I'm not sure what else to tell you, ma'am.

&gt;Her: Well, since you *admitted* that you have a repair center and you *admitted* that you don't want to help me, I'm just going to leave this here and I trust that you'll do your job. If not, I'll see you in court.

She writes her name and number down on a piece of paper and leaves it on the system despite my protests that she can't leave the system here, and we can't be held liable for it if she does. She ignores me and goes to leave with her kid. Just before she exits, she says, ""I'll call tomorrow to check on the progress!""

I put the system on the back counter, still wowed by what just happened. My manager comes in shortly afterwards and I tell her the goings-on. She recognizes the woman by her name and says it's not the first time she's done something like this. She decides not to call her and resigns to just put it in the back for now.

I didn't work the next day, but I heard afterwards that the lady called in and a different coworker talked to her, said the same thing I did, and she ranted and raved about *knowing* that we could repair it and were *choosing* not to. Apparently, she said she was coming in with the cops (?) but showed up by herself to get the system, cursing everyone in the store and basically being a lunatic. It only ended when my coworker threatened to call the cops on *her* for trespassing after she was told to leave.

Obviously nothing came of her legal threat. I'm just amazed that she thought her son's friend was a truth machine, or something. I mean, kids lie.

Award930,Very Patriotic lady tries to get $100 of merchandise for free by using her husbands rank in the army.,"TLDR: I work at a drugstore that has a photo department and dealt with a lady who tried to intimidate me into giving her $100 worth of graduation cards for free with her husbands rank in the army. 

So to start this off, this lady had submitted 2 orders of 120 graduation cards so far that didn’t meet her expectations and literally cost us about $200 in waste as she didn’t want the cards due to her mistakes. This was her 3rd order. We have specific layouts for specific card materials. I cannot change them whatsoever. 

I’m M=manager 
She’ll be CL= crazy lady 
CLF = crazy lady’s friend 

I see the cashier in the photo department at the counter with the crazy ladies friend. He is inspecting the cards and the cashier flags me down. 

M: Hi, how can I help you? 

CLF: These cards aren’t made correctly. They are supposed to have text on the back sheet. 

M: I do apologize but this card material you selected doesn’t have an option for text on the back. It tells you that before you submit them online. 

CLF: My friend is not going to be happy about this. Her husbands a drill Sargent in the army and they are VERY particular and strict. They called corporate and were told that you CAN put text on the back and it would be fixed.

M: yeah, there’s no way I can put text on these cards. The card printing machine doesn’t even have an option. Corporate must have been confused and shouldn’t have promised that. 

CLF: well, she won’t want these! 

M: Alright, no problem. 

I grab the cards and throw them into a special box we have for discarded customer prints. The guy walks away in a huff as I go to delete the order from our system. This 3rd order they did marked $300 wasted now in materials. 
About 1 minute later, the same guy comes back to the counter. This time, he is on the cellphone with the crazy lady. 

CLF: shes on the phone right now. She wants to talk to you. 

M: go ahead and put it on speaker, i cannot hold your phone. 

Cl: Uh yeah, I called corporate and they said I could have text on the back of my cards! I’m going to call again and complain due to you guys not being able to follow orders! 

M: Ma’am I’m not sure why corporate promises you these cards because I literally have no way of putting text on the back. Thy must have been confused. 

Cl: I DON’T CARE! THESE ARE MY DAUGHTERS GRADUATION CARDS AND THEY HAVE TO BE PERFECT!
MY HUSBAND IS A DRILL SARGENT AND THESE HAVE TO BE CORRECT! 

At this point. I look at her friend who has a big smirk on his face and tell him there’s nothing I can do. He takes if off speaker and hangs up. 

CLF: well alright, since this is the 3rd time YOU guys messed up, I’ll just take the cards as is and hopefully they accept them. Her husbands a drill Sargent and is really particular. 

M: Okay, let me get them out of the waste box. 

I proceed to dig them out of the box and put them on the counter and the guy goes to pick them up. 

M: Did you want to pay here? 

CLF: huh? Pay what? 

M: The cards?

CLF: They are ruined, she wants them for free. 

M: I cannot give you these cards for free. 

CLF: well if your going to trash them then why not give them for free? 

M: we take account for materials used and this is over $100. 

CLF: can you give me 90% off? 

M: Nope.

sweatycat,Somebody tried to shoplift from my store and failed terribly.,"So the women’s bathroom in the back of our store (we have three bathrooms) is broken, and doing anything in there will cause flooding. 

Well, one man had the idea of moving the blockade and tearing down the tape to sneak into that bathroom. He brought a knife to cut a package or possibly cut spider wrap (security device). He slipped up with the knife, cut his arm and cut an artery. Blood sprayed all over the bathroom. He walked across the store, bleeding profusely, and he made it out the doors and passed out at my store’s entrance from blood loss.

An overnight associate was the first to go into the broken bathroom. He called in a manager. They said it looked like a crime scene, which it pretty much was. The last time somebody got hurt and bled in my store they called a third party to clean it up, however this time it took our maintenance and a manager to clean the blood.

imfuckingAMAzing,4 year old trust issues,"I work in a clothes/everything shop in the UK, today I was working at the front of the store.

I had a Chinese family come in and buy lots of stuff, including a small handbag for one of the children, but they didn't buy any carrier bags so they put their stuff in two baskets. 

The baskets all have tags in them that set the door alarms off, which customers are told when they checkout. 

The family tried to go through the doors with the baskets, which set the alarms off. I went over and sorted everything and they were on their way.

About half an hour later the family comes back in and one of the Mams (who doesn't speak a lot of English) tries to speak to me about the handbag they bought earlier.

Customer: ""I bought bag 30 mins ago, please show her (points at 4yr old daughter), she took out earlier.""

I was confused as to what the customer meant but it clicked after a bit more explaining.

The customer had bought the handbag for her daughter, but since the door alarms went off when she left due to the baskets, the daughter thought that her Mam had stolen the bag! 

Apparently the daughter had been asking ""mammy why did you steal the bag"" for the past half an hour so they came back to the shop to get me to confirm that she had bought the bag. 

I explained to the girl that ""mammy didn't steal, she did buy the bag"" and passed the handbag in front of the doors to show that it doesn't set the alarms off. 
I then passed a basket in front of the doors, which did set the alarms off.

The daughter promptly apologised to her Mam and said thanks to me, followed by many thanks from the mother!

Me: Hello, did you find everything alright?

C: *peeved because she has been waiting in line* Yes, I’d just like to have these wrapped ASAP because I’m in a bit of a rush. 

Me: *scanning her items with mobile register, while talking, to get her through quickly* Of course, it’ll just be a few minutes after I finish your transaction. 

C: HELLO?? Is there a REASON you’re TEXTING instead of ringing me up? This is UNBELIEVABLE, I can’t believe what I’m SEEING right now!

Me: *looks at her visibly confused* I’m sorry? What seems to be the problem?

C: WHY ARENT YOU CHECKING ME OUT!? I JUST SAID IM IN A RUSH!!

Me: *flips mobile register over so that she can see the transaction list on the screen* This is my register at the moment, all of the other ones are busy, I apologize. 

(We’re really big on customer service, so you always have to ‘apologize’ even when they’re wrong, or just plain confusing)

C: NO! I just saw you texting!

Me: This phone doesn’t have texting capabilities, so you probably saw me typing in my employee code.

C: YOU WERE TEXTING

Me: I’m sorry, but that’s not possible. I can finish checking you out or I can get my manager if you’d like to make a formal complaint. 

C: I TOLD you I’m in a RUSH! 

Me: *puts on my best retail smile* Let me get my manager for ya! 

I walked away to get my manager and went home for the day 15 minutes early as an early Christmas present to me. 

Edit: Thank you all for the upvotes! :’) Hello new friends! I’m so happy to have an outlet to commiserate. ",TalesFromRetail,2442,1508596231
speedraecer,"Happy Birthday, James","From my phone, sorry for any formatting!! 

I work at a print shop within an office supplies retailer. It’s a thankless job so far, and getting yelled at is just part of my daily routine at this point. I was having another tough day last week when an order came in our email for a huge banner that read “Happy Birthday James” (name changed). The banner had pictures of who was presumably James, with everything from baby pictures to pictures of him as a young man. 

I got to work on it, printing it and reprinting it, repositioning the photos a little because it wasn’t quite straight and I wanted to get it right. I added an extra reinforced grommet so the banner would be easier to hang up (since it was pretty long). Finally I sent an email back that it was finished. 

A few hours later, a middle aged lady came to the counter and gave her name, which was the name on the banner order. I unfurled the banner so she could see. I remarked that I had to tweak it a little, but that I thought all the pictures were wonderful (especially the baby ones), and I was sure James was going to love his party. 

When I looked back up at the woman, tears were running down her face. She apologized and started sniffling and wiping them away, smiling and thanking me profusely. 

She tells me that James was her son. He died young in a car accident two years ago, and they were holding a party on his birthday in his honor. 

She was so happy that I put effort and heart into her banner that she was practically bawling. I couldn’t think of anything else to do but run around to the other side of the counter and hug her. She tried to tip me a few times but I can’t really take tips. I insisted it was my pleasure to make her son’s party a little better. 

Just one rewarding moment makes a week of getting yelled at totally worth it! ",TalesFromRetail,1808,1508525367
Buklawa,You should know!,"Hello everyone. Back again with another story from a wireless store.

Typing from my phone so excuse me for any mistakes.


Happened yesterday,

OL: old lady
Me: me

Me: good morning how is it going?

Ol: oh it is not going

Me: what's wrong

Ol : they shut off my phone service. I have been a customer for a long time and I always pay my bill in time.

at this point I am thinking she paid her bill but service is not working so I proceed to check her account.

Me : mam what's your phone number and your zip code?

Ol: it's in a system you should know.

Me: yes but I still need this information to look it up

Ol: gives me the number and zip

Me: I can't locate it is it postpaid or prepaid

Ol: do you guys know how to do your job?

Me: I certainly do that's why I work here now you didn't answer my question

Ol: I don't know

Me: I proceed with checking with her phone number.
Okay lady you are prepaid
What is your account pin?

Ol: I don't keep I never had a pin

Me: you should have one

Ol: try xxxx try xxxx try zxzz

Me: none of them are working

Ol: you guys are a joke I just need my service back

Me: that's what I am trying to look up for you you said you pay you bill in time.

Ol: yes why can't you just pay my bill.

Me: facepalm and pause........ Why didn't you just say I wanna pay my bill directly when you came in

Ol: you should know what I want without saying

Me: yes because this is a psychic shop not wireless location.

My manager was around and heard everything and was about to intervene

Me: how much you wanna pay?

Ol: I don't know 40 or 45

Me: yes which one of them?

Ol: just take 45

Did the transaction and when her service was back she spent good 30 minutes on the phone in the store talking loudly.

Wtf?.... ",TalesFromRetail,1532,1508505065
Willy_McBilly,A collectible 50p.,"On mobile, so apologies. Before I start, we need some backstory. Here in England we have 50p coins, and some of them are decorated to celebrate someone, an event, or landmark. These can be quite collectible. Last year a series of 5 coins was released to celebrate the author Beatrix Potter, and certainly the older generations liked to keep them. By far the most sought after coin featured a character called Peter Rabbit, and it wasn't uncommon for people to ask me to try and find one in my till for them.

Fast forward to today. The coins are rarer than they used to be, but they are also sought after by less people. A lady comes up to my till, buys a few things with a total of £3.50, and pays with exact change, one of the coins being a 50p. Naturally I glance at it and remarked it was one of the Beatrix 50p's. 

W-Woman
M-Me

M- ""That's one of those Potter 50p's, haven't seen one in a while.""

W- ""Oh sorry can I take that back? I've got 4 of them and I want to give all 5 to my granddaughter.""

So I give it back to her, and she can only give me a £1 coin. She now needs 50p change.

W- ""Sorry about that love, I've been trying to track down these coins for months and I just got this one (Beatrix Potter Seal) from across the road there!"" 

M- ""Oh really? Which ones have you got so far then?"" 

W- ""I've got the duck, squirrel, the hedgehog and the seal."" 

At this point I notice the queue is growing, so I start fumbling around for a 50p to give her as change. By chance I looked down and happened to notice the Peter Rabbit 50p was half buried in my till. The last coin she needed. I quickly fished it out, turned it face up so the lady didn't see the design and gave her the receipt. 

M- ""Well good luck finding that last one madam, hopefully it turns up soon!"" 

W- ""Thank you love, have a good shift"".

She walks away, but doesn't get far before looking at her change to put it in her purse. She turns around and looks at me, now serving another customer. She walks past my till and silently mouths ""thank you!"".

I nodded my head and smiled. Rarely have I seen anyone leave our store looking as overjoyed as she was, definitely the highlight of my day.

ttp213,Why don’t you sell.....?!,"Quick one from yesterday. 

So I work in an Australian supermarket, one of the big 2.  We sell all your usual supermarket grocery items plus an extremely limited garden/hardware selection. Coming into Spring we have some bags of mulch for sale, this is something we have sometimes, not a regular part of our range. (AW = annoying woman, Me = me)

AW - why don’t you sell potting mix?

Me - we have an extremely limited garden range, but we are primarily a grocery store, but there is a (insert name of massive hardware/garden supply store) just down there ( me pointing at the giant warehouse store 30 metres away)

AW - why should I go there if I can do all my shopping here?

Me - because we don’t sell potting mix, as it’s not part of our range

AW - but you have mulch!

Me - yes, which is different to potting mix.

j_lounz13,Family of Four Wants New Coats,"I should preface this story with the fact that I wasn't involved in this an any way, as much as I wish I would have been.

I work at a large retail store in which we sell a variety of winter coats. Two winters ago we had a family of four come in and they all needed new winter coats. This is a great day for the salesperson as a nice new coat is around $300. We did not have the styles/sizes they were looking for in stock so we special ordered all of the coats. 

Our special orders are quoted to take 2-4 weeks to arrive. In this time of waiting for their coats to come in, the mother calls the store. She explains that her husband had just passed away and they would no longer be able to buy the coats due to the financial stress they were in. 

The ladies in our special order department were the ones to receive this call. Instead of cancelling the family's order, they paid for the coats themselves. I thought this was a beautiful gesture, especially in the business of the holiday season. 

Just wanted to spread the tale of kindness as we enter another holiday season!",TalesFromRetail,1175,1508336386
Knever,"""You don't know that word? Well, then, obviously you know nothing of this language.""","I used to work at a Brazillian supermarket (in Florida). The customers were pretty much all Brazillians, leading to almost everybody speaking (Brazillian) Portuguese. My parents are from there, but I was born in North America. Although I do know how to speak Portuguese, sometimes my American accent bleeds through, and sometimes I don't know a word or two. Prople usually understand.

But not this one lady. Boy, did she have something to say. I was behind the customer service desk so I couldn't leave, but the lady asked me where something was. It was around the corner, near a certain shelf. I couldn't remember what the word for ""shelf"" was, so I think I said, ""fixture that holds things"" or something like that.

&gt; ""'Fixture that holds things'? What the heck is that? Do you even speak Portuguese?""

&gt;Yes, ma'am, I'm sorry I forgot the word for that (I point to the shelf), but what you're looking for is right around it.

Keep in mind, the shelf was in sight of both of us, but she didn't want to look.

&gt; You don't speak Portuguese. Get me someone else to help.

I'm a little confused (I mean, it's just one word I didn't know) but my manager happens to appear and I figure she's not busy.

(Keep in mind, this is all in perfect Portuguese)
&gt; Maria, would you be able to help this woman? Apparently, I don't speak Portuguese so I'm not able to communicate with her. She doesn't understand anything I'm saying, because, even though it sounds like Portuguese, she said it's not, so, honestly, I'm not really sure what language I'm speaking. But, that doesn't really matter, I guess. She needs help finding (item), which I said was over there, but I guess she needs to hear that in Portuguese, which, again, I apparently don't speak.

It turned out that Maria was well aware of this customer and she complained about *everything*, so she wasn't surprised that she was acting like an idiot. She almost stopped as she had to stifle some laughter during my monologue. The lady just kind of looked like someone had slapped her with an idiot stick.",TalesFromRetail,6849,1508300823
Darian_Biron,Confused about return policy,"So I'm at cash ringing this lady through, and when I ring someone through I put there receipt in the bag and then hand them the bag. At the bottom of the receipt it says our policy of no returns and no exchanges, standard receipt. So she takes her bag and pulls the receipt out and starts to walk away. As I say hi to the next person and they start to put there stuff on the counter the previous woman barges back over to me, pushing the person in line back a step.

""This says no returns or exchanges""

""Yes ma'am that's our company policy.""

""Well I don't want it if i can't return it, give me my money back.""

Now at this point I was a little confused because a) she just read on her receipt that I can't do a return and b) why doesn't she want it if it's non returnable. So I tell her I can't, we don't do returns. She doesn't take this news well and starts ranting and raving, she wants a manager she wants her money back and she's refusing to leave my counter until all of that happens. So I sigh and call my manager and ask her to please wait to the side of the cash register, she says no and that she's going to wait right where she is....At my till. 

I call another cashier to make sure the line keeps moving and wait, all the while this woman is glaring at me. My manager comes over and I go to explain the situation when the woman stops me. 

""This stupid employee of yours won't issue me a return.""

""Im Sorry ma'am but we don't do returns, please do not insult my employees or ill ask for you to remove yourself.""

""She is stupid, your stupid, I want my money back.""

Now mind you all of this is happening right in my face and when the manager tried to move her to the side she refuses to be moved. My manager flat says we don't do returns, please leave or she will be forced to leave. The woman is not phased and keeps on standing there. So the manager calls our bigger male employee, he's a total teddy bear but his size implys other wise and we've used him to remove unruly customers before.

So he comes and I want to be clear he doesn't touch her he just uses his bulk to kind of invade her space and make her move away from him. He soon corals her out the door and locks it until she fully walks away. Meanwhile all the customers in line are watching and my manager is also still there. She looks to me and puts a hand on my shoulder telling me I can go home now if I want because my shift ends in twenty minutes. I thank her and collect my stuff and still wondering why she didn't want items that were non returnable.",TalesFromRetail,1677,1508245829

PrincessTiffany,The Name,"Retail Shop does click &amp; collect (order online, pick up from public place) with 3rd party delivery company.


Mrs Name. = Parcel Collector

PrincessTiffany = Me


It's very busy. Parcel collectors have to queue up like normal customers. It's a nightmare because the inadequately sized storage area for the parcels is in the back of the shop, so when there's a huge queue the cashiers have to leave and go hunt for a parcel that might not even be there.


&gt;Mrs. Name: I've come to collect my parcel.

That's nice.

&gt;PrincessTiffany: I need your name.


&gt;Mrs. Name: Oh, my name is Mrs. Name.


&gt;PrincessTiffany: Thank you, I'll go and have a look for it.

Go into the back. Storage area for parcels was never intended for the volume we now receive. 7 new packages arrived today for collection, Mrs. Name isn't on any of them. Great. This part is especially fun, the retailers and delivery company have a habit of sending out the 'Your parcel has arrived' email early. I then have to deal with this, even though I have nothing to do with either the retailer they ordered from or the delivery company. Time to tell Mrs. Name the bad news.


Back to tills. Queue very big now.


&gt;PrincessTiffany: Ok, Mrs. Name, there are no parcels in the back for a Mrs. Name.

&gt;Mrs. Name: I have the email on my phone, it says that it will be here today.

&gt;PrincessTiffany: It has happened before that the delivery company send out the emails early, even though the parcel has not actually arrived yet.


Mrs. Name pulls out her phone.


&gt;Mrs. Name: See, here, [STORE ADDRESS] it says it will be here today, so it must be here.

&gt;PrincessTiffany: I can assure you it isn't here. There are no Parcels with Mrs. Name on.

&gt;Mrs. Name: It says it is here.


She is getting angry. She has the face on like 'I'm going to complain about this and you' even though I have literally no culpability at all. Nothing to do with the delivery company or the retailer she's ordered from. Nothing I can do. No numbers I can call.

&gt;PrincessTiffany: There are 7 parcels in the back that came today, none of them are labelled as Mrs. Name.

&gt;Mrs. Name: It says it is here.

&gt;PrincessTiffany: I don't really know what you want me to do, if it isn't here I can't make it be here. If you have an issue you need to get in touch with the people you ordered the parcel from or the delivery company directly.

&gt;Mrs. Name: Did you check for my old name?

&gt;PrincessTiffany: I'm sorry?

&gt;Mrs. Name: I changed my name about a year ago, did you check for my old name?

&gt;PrincessTiffany: I don't know your old name...

&gt;Mrs. Name: *Sigh*, It's Mrs. OldName.

Mental Face Palm.

Malfurious_Stormrage,I told them to slow down!,"So this happened almost 8 years ago when I was working in the photo department of a popular retail store.  
I am minding my own business, working on some orders when I see a kid (probably 12-14 years old) zoom past my counter, rolling on his shoes with the wheels embedded in them. I believe they are called heelies?  
Anyways, on his 2nd pass, I tell him he needs to slow down, because I didn't want this hooligan to knock over a shelf or get himself hurt.  
This kid totally ignores me, and continues zooming past, and not 10 seconds later, I witness it. One of the greatest moments of instant karma iv'e seen working retail.  
As I am watching him roll away, the front of a shopping cart comes jutting out the end of the aisle directly ahead of him, and I watch in utter bliss as he literally tumbles head first over the cart, landing with a thump on the other side with his feet hanging above his head.  
I had to summon all my willpower to not laugh, but when that kid finally stumbled back on to his feet and looked my way, he knew.  
The look of pure embarrassment on his face was excellent. He exited the store so fast, the customer who was pushing the karma cart didn't even have time to ask if he was alright.",TalesFromRetail,623,1508000271

One bloke came in, more pissed than any other customer I've ever had here, saying he ordered this two weeks ago, he should have it by now! I asked what he ordered and told me what it was, I looked at our orders and told him a text had been sent to him a week ago.

He looked at his phone and hadn't received a text, I looked at my phone and of course, the text had been sent. I read the phone number aloud and it was wrong.

I checked the paper he wrote, and the number matched exactly. He read it and blurted out ""that's not a 7 it's a 0!"". How you can get the two mixed up is beyond me, but it absolutely said 7.

 I work at your friendly neighborhood 24 Convenience Store and we have a little 'Take a Penny, Leave a Penny' tray next to the card machine.

They're kind of on my side of the counter and a little tricky to get out of their display so I grab the one he's pointing to and scan it, the total is about $1.15.

Me: Is that all for today?

SM: Yup.

He pulls out a quarter and a dime from his pocket and then proceeds to dump the whole take a penny tray on the counter and starts counting out the rest of his bill.

Me: *stunned* Um sir, I'm sorry you are welcome to use a coin or two but you can't just take everything

SM: No no it's fine I put change in here all the time

Me: *trying to seperate his coins from the take a penny coins* no sir I'm sorry but -

At this point he gets to his total which is the entirety of the change we had in the tray and grabs his lighter from next to my hand across the counter and quickly heads out.

I just kind of dumbly stood there for a second before putting the change in the till and completing the transaction, silently cursing the gods.

I serve the next customer and then Nice Guy comes up to the till, looking kinda bewildered.

NG: Well damn, if all he wanted was a lighter I would have bought it for him

Me: Yeah I wasn't really expecting that 

I finish his transaction and he slides over to the side of the counter.
NG: I just need a second to sort out my bag, that okay?

I say it's no problem, usually people just take up the whole counter and I appreciate that he's moved over considering the high schoolers have just descended so I can keep the line moving.

A few seconds later I'm done with the customer behind him and NG stands up and dumps a handful of dimes and nickles into the take a penny tray.
NG: I don't need that small change anyways, have a great day!

I've had many crappy customers since, but remembering this nice one makes me smile

irradiatedcutie,Grilled Cheese Lady,"I worked at a popular bakery place, they’re known for their broccoli cheddar soup and bread bowls. Anyway, I worked at this place for a total of 4 days. 

My first day was the worst in which I sliced open my hand cleaning dishes and spilled ice tea in my eyes but that’s not what stands out.

On my 4th day of work, I got in a little early and I was trained to work the dining room, barista section and register. It was pretty slow, right before the lunch rush so there’s like maybe 4 customers right now. I’m making a watermelon lemonade for a customer when a lady wanders up to the counter. 

Now my location does table service where you order and people will deliver the food to your table so when someone comes up to the counter, you know it’s not gonna end well. 

I’m making the drink and this lady starts banging on the counter and she’s old, like probably 60s. I tell her I’ll be with her in a moment and she just scoffs. I know if I put it off longer she’ll get angrier so I finish the drink, grab it and wander up to the counter. I ask how I can help her. 

She had half a grilled cheese clutched in her hand with one bite taken out of it and she looks livid. 

“This grilled cheese is BURNT! How dare you serve this to me! I demand you make me a new one!” I nod and tell her I’ll remake it right away.  She throws the grilled cheese at me but it misses. I ignore it, pick the sandwich off the floor and throw it away, I don’t wanna get in it with her so I ignore it. 

As I’m pulling out the bread and cheese, this lady reaches over the counter and grabs the drink I made to which I say 

“Ma’am, that’s not for you, please put it down.” I tell her, getting fed up with this lady so I’m working fast to make her grilled cheese so she can just leave. She doesn’t listen and begins drinking it to which I say 

“You didn’t pay for that, it’s not yours.” Annoyance is in my voice but she doesn’t care, she keeps drinking. 

“You messed up my sandwich, I deserve it.” She tells me, a smug look on her face. I smile and gesture over to the registers and say

“If you want it I can ring you up for it.” Trying to get back at her for putting me through grief. 

She glares at me and goes “Fine! I don’t want it!” And throws it at me. I scream in shock, it’s cold and wet and sticky and this lady is just laughing. My manager comes from the back and asks what’s going on. I rip off my hat, throw it on the ground and scream “I quit!” I then stomp out of the store, angry as all hell but at this time I didn’t have a car to get home so I walked across 6 lanes of traffic to get to the shopping center near by to just get away from this store and this lady. 

I cried in the mall bathroom and my bf came to pick me up but he had to buy me new clothes cause I was sticky and wet still.

That was my 4 day job at a bakery, I now work at a rich people preschool which has its own troubles but at least old ladies don’t throw watermelon lemonades at you. ",TalesFromRetail,627,1507736531
JayEster,"""We hate money here.""","Today a woman came into my store asking for cigarettes. Usually these are the fastest transactions so I figured this would be too. This was not one of those times.

The woman's card was rejected; sometimes that happens when people enter the wrong PIN or removing the card too fast. I ask her to do it again.

It's still rejected. At this point, it's because you probably don't have the funds.

&gt;Ma'am, I'm sorry but your card has been rejected. Do you have another form of payment?

&gt;Crazy Lady: MOVE YOUR HAND AWAY FROM THE REGISTER!

&gt;Ooo-kay...

I place my hands flat on the counter where she can see them. Around now a line started forming so I called over another coworker to open another register since this would take much longer than a normal transaction.

She tries one more time and of course it gets rejected.

&gt;Ma'am, your card is rejected. It's not working, do you have another form of payment?

&gt;CL: YOU'RE REJECTING MY CARD! YOU DON'T WANT TO SELL ME MY CIGARETTES!

Yeah, cause it's not my job to sell you things or anything. In fact that's the opposite goal of this store.

Now, I call my manager as she's yelling loudly and refusing to leave.

&gt;CL: WHERE'S YOUR MANAGER?! I DEMAND TO SEE A MANAGER! HE'S GONNA FIRE YOU!

Yeah, that's how that works.

Now my manager arrives and tries to calm her down.

&gt;Manager: Ma'am, your card is rejected. There's nothing we can do.

&gt;CL: YOU PEOPLE ARE COMPLETE IDIOTS! THIS IS STRESSING ME OUT, I DEMAND MY CIGARETTES AS COMPENSATION!

&gt;M: Get out.

&gt;CL: YOU CAN'T TELL ME TO LEAVE! THAT'S ILLEGAL!

&gt;M: It's my store, I run this place. Now I'll tell you again, GET OUT!

&gt;CL: I'M STAYING TILL YOU COMPENSATE ME FOR MY MENTAL TRAUMA!

&gt;M: Do you want to go to jail?

He picks up the phone and she leaves saying she's gonna call the cops on us.

We eventually had to call the cops cause she was outside threatening people to buy her cigarettes.",TalesFromRetail,4200,1507687142
Kouyate42,Do these people not know custom orders are precisely that- custom?,"This one happened yesterday. I work in a curtains shop which offers custom products, mostly curtains and blinds but also furniture too. The way it works, you place an order with us for your items, we send it off to the workroom to be made and then depending on item it's either sent to store to be picked up or delivered direct to the home in the case of furniture. Every order is treated as an individual, with everything being done from scratch from cutting fabric or making a sofa frame to making the covers. 

  For this, we have a display of fabrics and generic examples of curtain for people to see the different options and choose their styles/fabrics and accessories. Our computer carries even more options. This is my department for the most part, so I can handle most things. 

  Yesterday I see a woman looking at some fabrics, and I go over to see if she needs help or a quote doing or whatever. She asked me a bunch of questions about various things to do with size and some options we offer, and then asked:

&gt; customer: how long do these take to be made up? 

&gt; me: well, we give a guideline of around 4 weeks for curtains, but things can come back faster depending on how busy the workroom is and what you've ordered. However we can get them back faster, and we'd give you a call as soon as they're ready. 

Now this is only a guideline. As I say, we can get things back faster but this is dependent on our workroom, not us. But we have to tell people 4 weeks as a standard. 

&gt;customer: *angry* seriously? For curtains? How difficult is it to sew a piece of fabric?! That's ridiculous! 

She continued for a good couple of minutes in this vein. I did try and explain: 

&gt;me: these are completely custom orders done for you. They do everything from scratch from cutting the fabric to size to adding in all the things you request. They could be dealing with a couple of hundred orders at a time so it takes time. 

At this point she just stormed off shouting 'bloody ridiculous!' I was somewhat glad when this happened as it just wasn't going in whatsoever. 

 Sad thing is, this isn't the first time it's happened. I also know people who do other custom products who've told me they've had the same. :/

staticleway,Flower Power,"So ill start by saying this is my first ever post so apologies for the formatting issues.

So basically this happened at a store where we mainly deal with phones and phone contracts etc.
So this customer came in and was wanting to downgrade her plans but also needed a new phone. 

It all started with the usual questioning, basic small talk etc to try work out a solution when the customer slowly opens up to me. Her husband has cancer which has become a lot more major, he had to go back to work (in the mines which is even worse) due to their lack of income. She was a teacher, and struggled to keep it cool at school. She slowly just broke down to the point where she started crying. She told me how her car had recently been written off, so she didnt have a way around and was hiring a vehicle, her heater at home broke and home insurance wasn't covering it, they got broken into and then her medical insurance refused to pay her Husbands medical bills past $2000 which had amassed to over $6000.

She started crying and I could tell she hadn't vented or spoken of these issues before. I gave her a hug, then quickly ducked out back to ask a colleague to go grab some flowers from the local store nearby. 

When my co-worker returned i gifted her these flowers, and then she cried again but with happyness.
 She said "" I haven't told anyone of these issues, and I never intended on doing this in public and to a stranger I'm so sorry i feel so embarrassed""

Me ""hey its alright, sometimes all you need is to vent, and on top of that sometimes strangers are the best choice as they don't know you or your past so are more open to listen""

Customer ""Thanks so much for the flowers, its people like you who keep me going sometimes, you just made me realize how important it is to keep focused for my partners sake. ""

We then finished everything up, saved her some money and she walked out happy. 

A week later she returned into the store with her husband and gave me a box of chocolates and thanked me again. 

Sorry again for any formatting issues feel free to let me know what to improve on!

kalvinbastello,What...what are you doing here?,"This post https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/748wl9/were_closed/ made me think of this stunning moment of human intelligence a a year ago at the store, and I thought I'd share it.

We had this big remodel project. The place hadn't been touched in...35~ years, so it was time. We planned it, made announcements, etc. The day we started this massive two week project, we had signs on the door, plus the various service trucks in the parking lot. 

All of the employees are busy moving the massive inventory between parts of the store as the remodeling people do their stuff. During most of it, we have a few-like items stacked, floor to head, in a big, like 15 feet circle on the ground, in the middle of the store. Shelves are moved, items are everywhere, bundles of wires and computers here and there, everything is in disarray. 

An hour or so after lunch, we're doing our thing and just happen to be at the front counter. A guy comes up to make a transaction, as in has stuff in his hand, has put it on the counter (next to piles of other stuff) and gets our his wallet.  I look at him, and at my coworker who was with me, and asked if he just grabbed that from a shelf. He said yeah, but it was hard to get around because it's ""kind of messy in here."" I wasn't sure if I should have hit him, but I think I just starred for a a few seconds before drawling out ""Uh...yeah we're doing a two week remodeling project,"" and started in how we're closed, can't do any business, and he'd have to come back or we could call him, maybe? He seemed kind of jarred by this, and a light went off that oh yeah, being closed would kind of make sense seeing our current mess. 

I have no idea how long he was in there, or in what state he goes in thinking this place is open when his frequent shopper's card clearly state's he's seen this place in a much, much better shape. I wonder if he was in a daze, or just trying to bully his way to do business, but lacked the gall to demand and follow through like other people? 

Weird. Job would be great without people, amirite?",TalesFromRetail,824,1507204927
LilacPenny,We’re closed...,"If there isn’t a subreddit called ‘We’re closed, ma’am’ then there really should be!! One night when we were CLOSED not closING but CLOSED. We had sent out the *Please take your items to the register and pay for your purchases* page about half an hour ago, turned OFF THE FUCKING LIGHTS, turned off the music, done our walk through to check for any customers, pulled the shutters down, and had our coats on. 

Our walk through is very thorough so I have NO IDEA where this woman was hiding. But I looked back at the registers as I was zipping up my coat AND SOMEONE WAS UNLOADING THEIR FUCKING GROCERIES ON THE TILL. 

This was about 10 minutes AFTER the lights went off. The store was quite literally pitch black save for a few emergency lights so I have no fucking idea how she didn’t get the hint. Me and my supervisor walked up to her and the following exchange happened:

Sup: Um..ma’am..we closed about 20 minutes ago..you’re going to have to leave...

Customer: What?! Well why didn’t anyone tell me! 

Sup: We...we did a page, and turned off the lights...ma’am I’m sorry but there’s no way I can ring you through. 

C: Well this is just horrible customer service! How am I supposed to feed my family! 

(*maybe don’t do your shopping at 10pm???*)

Sup: I’m sorry, you can come back tomorrow but we really have to lock up now. 

C: Whatever, I’ll finish my shopping elsewhere!

Then she walked up to the automatic doors THAT HAD BIG STEEL SHUTTERS OVER THEM and started waving her fucking arms for them to open. We ended up having to escort her out through the employee exit and spent another 10 minutes putting all her fucking groceries back. ",TalesFromRetail,4648,1507131140
schune,Code Adam,"Many of you probably know what Code Adam means, if you're not familiar with it [here is a Wiki-link explaining it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Adam) I worked at a big retail store as a teen while I was in high school. One day over the intercom we hear ""Code-Adam, Code-Adam, (and then a description and name of a young girl) wearing a pink jacket."" Everyone is instructed to drop everything you are doing, including helping any customers, and start looking for this missing child. 

As far as I know, this had never happened in the history of my store and it was strange seeing workers frantically run around. I worked in one of the largest sections of the store which covered paint, tools, hardware, lumber, and the list goes on... all told probably 10-15 aisles, and of course I was the only one in my department at the time as my department manager happened to be on break. But, because they were pretty wide open, they were fairly easy to check and see that there was no child there. 

After you check your own department, you are instructed to help other departments look as well. One of the hardest sections to look thru is sporting goods because a. it was our biggest department and b. there were lots of places for a kid to hide, ice houses (I'm from a northern region in the U.S., I realize this may be an unfamiliar concept to a lot of you but they are exactly what they sound like), canoes, hunting clothes racks and so on. 

Now this process had gone on for probably a good 15 minutes with that same message coming over the intercom every couple of minutes. The thought of an actual abduction had crossed my mind more than once. After coming up short in my own department and sporting goods I decided to go back to my department and look again hoping I'd missed something. 

Something told me to look in the lighting section (ceiling fans, chandeliers, etc.) This wasn't my department as it was technically an extension of the ""building"" department, but it was nestled in the corner of the store and was right next to my department and sporting goods. The department is surprisingly dim for a “lighting” department. 

In the very back corner (on an end-cap) I saw a little pink jacket behind a box and I knew right away it was the little girl. We are instructed to use the phones throughout the store to go over the intercom and “call off the Code Adam” but I had long forgotten the digits to punch and I didn’t much care, I just wanted to get this scared little girl to her parents. 

As I reached down and pulled off the box away that she was hiding behind I could see she was terrified, and had been crying, on top of that I noticed she was autistic. I’m sure hearing her name called out by a random voice over the intercom multiple times didn’t help. I have a little bit of experience with autistic people and I knew enough that she probably wouldn’t react well to strangers. I asked her if her name was the name I had heard and if she was lost. She nodded and I asked her if she would like to hold my hand and I would take her to her parents. Without saying anything she grabbed my outstretched hand and we walked to the front of the store to find her parents. On our way some of my co-workers noticed me and sent the message to the FEO’s (front end operators - basically glorified cashiers) and when we got to the front end she immediately ran to her father who I could tell had also been crying. It felt good to have been the one to find her and it’s one of the 2 or 3 actual memories I have from working there for over a year.

Edit: Many of you are quick to point out my error, I noticed she had Down syndrome, not autism. My mistake! Sorry if I offended anybody!

Edit 2: I realize the policy is to not announce the child's name over the intercom, I might be remembering it wrong because if happened over 5 years ago, or my company had a breach of policy. Either way wouldn't surprise me! Another theory I had was that the dad knew his daughter wasn't abducted but just lost so he felt comfortable announcing the name? I'm not sure you guys, just sharing how I remember it! ",TalesFromRetail,3865,1507062202
LibrarianBelle,Lady forgets what a fitting room is for,"Ok, it’s been five years since I’ve been in retail but reading the stories here reminded me of a good one.

I worked at the store known for red and often had to close. One night we had a group of ladies in the back of the clothing section. I’m folding towels when my radio goes off asking me to come to the front.

My manager was laughing so hard he was nearly crying! “Hey, could you go tell those ladies in clothing we do have a dressing room.”

“Why?” I asked, confused.

Security ushered me into the camera room and pointed to one of the feeds. Y’all, this woman was trying on clothes in the middle of the floor! Apparently the teenagers were too scared to go say anything and the managers that night were male.

I head over and thankfully get there while she’s got her shirt on. “Ma’am, our fitting rooms are still open if you’d like to try on anything.”

The customer gave me a really confused look, “What?”

I pointed to the very visible camera mounted to the ceiling, “Security asked me to inform you the cameras are on and they saw you trying on shirts. We just wanted to let you know there was a more private place to do so.”

Her friends are all but rolling on the floor at this point as she finally gets what I’m saying, “Y’all have video of me...”

“In your bra, yes ma’am.” I pointed out the dressing room about 10 feet away, “I can help you at the fitting room if there is anything else you’d like to try on.”

Neurotic_Marauder,An Unexpected Customer,"This happened a few days ago. The names of those involved have been changed to protect the innocent.
   

I was on register duty at the clothing store I work at.  
  
A customer came up with an insulated jacket. Her head was down, so I couldn't really see her face. She was searching something on her phone.  
 
""I'm just checking to see if the coat is down, I'm allergic.""  
 
I shrugged and scanned the coat and removed the security tag.  
 
As I was putting the coat into a plastic bag, the customer let out a small gleeful squeal and did a little jump.  
 
""I'm just so excited! I love this coat!""  
 
Again, I thought her behavior was a little odd... but strangely familiar.  
 
I moved on to asking the customer for her e-mail to see if she was in the store's system.  
 
""claire.jacobson@fakeemail.com""  
 
As I typed in her last name, the gears began to slowly turn inside my head.   
 
*I haven't heard that name in years... the only person I knew who ever had that name was-*  
 
I looked up, and for the first time in 17 years I was looking at the face of my 4th grade teacher, Mrs. Jacobson.  
   
I didn't know what to say, I actually covered my mouth and muttered ""oh my god"" several times before finally saying:  
 
""You're Mrs. Jacobson""  
 
""Yes?""  
   
It was then that I realized that I was about 2 feet taller than I was the last time I saw her, and I now had a full beard and glasses. There's no way she could possibly recognize me.

""I don't know if you remember me, but you were my 4th grade-""  
 
Her eyes immediately widened and darted to my name tag.  
 
**""NEUROTIC MARAUDER!!!""**  
 
She immediately wrapped me in a hug as I was still trying to comprehend what was happening.    
 
We briefly caught up with each other - she told me about the family she has now, I told her about what I did after high school and college, etc.
 
Finally, after promising to add her on Facebook, she left and I was left with my dumbfounded co-workers staring at me.   
 
My manager immediately came on the radio and asked:  
 
""My wife is never that happy to see me, who was that?""    
 
Despite someone stealing shoes later that day and an older customer complaining to me about shirt prices for several minutes, I couldn't shake that smile I had after seeing Mrs. Jacobson again.
 
**tl;dr** I reunited with my 4th grade teacher after 17 years while working the register at my store

I snap and say ""You have to pay the tax on the full value of the product"". She then shows me the fine print of the coupon which literally says ""To the consumer: Applicable taxes charged on full value before coupon redemption."" I read it out loud to her and she starts grabbing her things off the counter and starts walking away. As she does, she again says that I did it wrong and that a good cashier would take the value of the coupon off the product before adding tax. I bet she says that a lot.

Krackensantaclaus,I just got robbed at gunpoint... Again,"Thanks for the gold, stranger

Hey, Reddit, my store just got hit for the second time this week! This time I was alone. 

I was sitting behind the register, fucking around on my phone, when I looked up to see a hooded figure walking in. 

*Damn it, this isn't happening AGAIN is it? Maybe he's just got his hood on.*

He turned the corner, and I saw the bandana on his face. 

*Fuck!*

Robber pulls out a revolver and tells me to empty the register and give him two cartons of cigarettes. I give him the cash and go over to the cigarettes. 

""We're out of those, you want something else?""
""Give me Kool menthols""
""We only have one""
""Ok, give it to me""

I have him everything, and then everything turned around. 

""Put your fucking hands in the air!""

A childhood friend of mine, who runs a security company just happened to be pulling in for some oil. I look up to see him with his gun drawn at the guy. 

The robber pushes his way out of the store, where my friend and the robber start grappling. I step out to inform my friend that he's armed, turn around to go inside so I can talk to security over the PA. When I turned around, the robbers face was bloodied up. 

Apparently my friend popped him in the eye brow with the muzzle of his gun. 

I step back outside to relay more information to 911 dispatch,  and my friend told me to grab his cuffs from his truck. 

Local PD arrived on scene, and a gung-ho officer almost put a tazer on me, luckily she didn't have it turned on yet, or I would probably be in the hospital typing this. 

The robbers gun was apparently a BB gun, but he's now looking at 10-25 with no priors. My other childhood friend, who runs the company with my other friend showed up around this time and I got caught up with them. 

I put in my two weeks notice, and am now looking at joining my friends' security firm.",TalesFromRetail,4286,1506759782
Lordxeen,"Dollar coins they are a thing, and they're not new.","Night shift at the gas station. Through the course of the night someone paid with a stack of golden $1 coins. These have been in circulation since 2000 so they aren't exactly 'new' anymore.

Some time later a man pays for his goods and his change due is $1.45. I hand him 4 coins: dollar, quarter, and two dimes. I wish him a good day and turn to my next customer. The man gets halfway out the door before he stops and jingles the coins in his hand. He spins on his heel and strides back to my counter.

Man: ""I should have got a dollar back.""

Xeen: ""I beg your pardon?""

M: ""I should have gotten a dollar back just now.""

X: ""Well,"" (I see the coins I gave him still in his hand) ""how much did I give you?""

M: *thrusts his hand forward* ""This!""

Now accusing me of short changing you means one of two things, you think I've made a mistake or you think I'm a crook. Frankly I don't care for that at all and if there's proof that I didn't right in your goddamned hand my patience starts to drain away really goddamn fast.

X: ""Again, SIR, how much is that?""

M: ""I dunno, a few coins?""

I realize I'm not making headway with this approach.

X: ""You appear to be holding two dimes, one quarter, and a dollar. Totaling $1.45. Will that be all?""

M: *Stares at his hand, squints* ""I thought that was a quarter, you should warn people when you give those out."" 

X: ""...""


Second incident the same morning, change for a different man is $1.85, I give him another of the golden dollars, 3 quarters and a dime. He slides it into his pocket and says

Man2: ""I've still got a dollar coming.""

Xeen in head: ""You absolutely do not and I will prove it to you.""

Xeen out loud: *tapping the counter* ""Lets see what I gave you.""

M2: ""What?""

X: ""Empty your pocket, let's see what you got.""

M2: ""Its mixed in with my other change now.""

X: *tap tap tap* ""C'mon, it'll be fun."" (There may have been a predatory grin on my face at this point)

M2: ""Uh, well here but like I said there was already some change in my pocket.""

Ignoring the 6 pennies and nickel that came out with what I'd given him I reach into the mess and pull out the only gleaming golden coin in the lot.

X: ""I'm willing to bet there wasn't a golden dollar coin in your pocket when you left home this morning.""

M2: ""... Oh."" *departs*



Story number three. Clearly these coins are causing brain damage to my customers so I better stop unloading them one at a time and get rid of my last two at the earliest opportunity. Man3 has $14.37 change due, here!

X: ""$14.37 is your change, have a nice day.""

Man3: ""You gave me twelve.""

X: I will bet you $1000 that I gave you 14 dollars and 37 cents!""

M3: *Sly grin* ""Alright.""

I take his right hand and count off a 10 dollar bill, two singles, then I open his clenched left hand and count the other two dollars, quarter, dime and two pennies.

X: ""Ten, eleven twelve... thirteen, fourteen, 14.25, 14.35, 14.36, fourteen dollars and thirty seven cents, PAY UP!""

Needless to say, he did not.",TalesFromRetail,3384,1506721893
LilacPenny,THAT'S ILLEGAL!,"This is not one of my proudest moments, but it felt really good. I was a grocery store cashier and had been for almost 2 years when this happened. I was job hunting and planning on quitting anyway so I was kinda playing it fast and loose with my filter. 

Our store was a 'bag your own groceries' place but if it was really slow, or the customer *really* needed help I had no problem helping them. But it was NOT part of my job and we didn't have 'baggers'. 

It was EXTREMELY busy. The only people on cash were me and my supervisor and we each had a line about ten people deep. The customer in question pushed all my buttons. Not using a divider so his shit got mixed up with the next persons, not labeling a bulk nut item so I had to send a shelf stocker back to get the code, talking on the phone while I was trying to tell him his total, throwing money all over my counter instead of placing it in my open hand. 

So he pays and he had about 6 items. I push his stuff to the end of the counter, toss a plastic bag on top, and move onto the next customer. I just wanted to be done with him. This guy. This ignorant GUY finally gets off his phone and SCREAMS at me:

'HEY!!! HEEEEEEY!'

Me: Yes?!

'WHY DID YOU NOT BAG THIS!!!!!'

Me: (simultaneously scanning the next customers groceries and talking to him) I'm sorry, we're super busy, there's a bag right on top you can use!

'THAT IS NOT RIGHT!!'

Me: (actively ignoring him at this point)

'HEY!! THIS IS CANADA!! IT IS ILLEGAL NOT TO BAG A PAYING CUSTOMERS GROCERIES IN CANADA!!!'

Me: (literally speechless, and now I'm really pissed. In the time he was yelling he could've just done it himself and been gone) SURE THING!!!

I stop scanning the next customers stuff, pick up the bag, and start slamming his shit into it. Bread first, spaghetti sauce next, and then drop everything else on stop. Then I slid/pushed it all the way to the end of the counter and screamed HAVE A NICE DAY!!!!

His face dropped and he grabbed his bag and left. Every other transaction went smoothly and me and my supervisor had a good laugh about it in the cash room that night. I'm proooobably gonna get downvotes for this one lol but if it makes you feel any better I never took another retail job and don't plan to. I can't deal with people like this in person all day long again. ",TalesFromRetail,4612,1506643760
chdlsea,Customer tried to return something he didn't buy,"So I have a story that I think would work here. I live in Canada and used to work the customer service/return desk at a red shirt wearing store. This story is about how I almost caught someone trying to steal. 

I was working the morning shift during the week and it wasn't too busy yet. Probably around 10 or 11am. 

This customer comes up to the desk with a pair of work boots, they had the tags on and looked brand new. (Which is what we want all returns to look like). The customer service desk is right next to the entrance and I usually watch the people come into the store. This day I was doing some paper work behind the desk and I didn't see him come into the store but I could have missed him. So first red flag. 

I did my usual greeting and asked how I could help. He said he wanted to return the boots but didn't have a receipt. Our store would sometimes take returns without receipts but you would only get a store credit and it would be for the lowest price in the last 90 days as they do not have the proof of how much they paid. But he said he wanted to exchange them so no big deal. I can do that. 

I told him to go and look for another pair and I'll do the exchange when he gets back. While he is gone I look on the computer and the last pair we sold of that boot was 9 months ago and we only have one in stock. I call the sports department and ask to find the pair. Bet you can guess where this is going...  there is an empty spot where the boots should be and the boots are no where to be found. 

I tried to call the owner as he has access to the security cameras in the store and I wanted him to find the guy walking in with the boots. I don't like the accuse people of steeling unless I'm 100% sure. Unfortunately he's not in the store. 

The guy came back this is the conversation we had- C for customer. Me for me. 

C: I couldn't find the size I need. Can I just get a refund?
Me: No, without a receipt the best we can do is a store credit but it will be for the lowest sale price in the last 90 days. 
C: I guess that will work. 
Me: when did you get the boots? And which store did you buy them from?
C: I bought them from this store about a month ago 
Me: are you sure? The computer shows the last sale we had on these boots was 9 months ago. 
C: yeah... it wasn't that long ago. 
Me: ok... can I get your phone number and name for the return
C: ..... Actually I think my wife just got here... she has the reciept. I'll go get the reciept. 

He reached for the boots but I kept hold of them. 
Me: I can hold on to them while you get the receipt. 

The customer paused, turned and walked quickly out of the store. We didn't see him again. 

We have had people try this before and it has worked. They come in, pick something up from the shelf and take it to customer service. If they are not paying attention they will tell the customer they can't return it with out a reciept and they get to walk out with it.  

It's not a very eventful store but makes me smile. 
TL;DR: customer tried to return something he didn't buy.

JSqueaks,"""Can you come handle a lizard situation at the cash wrap???""","I work in a fairly large shoe store and we had just had a truck deliver product. As usual we have 3-5 boxes of smaller ""cash wrap"" items behind the register to fill as the day goes on, while/if its slow.

She points to a shoe box lid on the counter.

I slowly lift the lid, preparing to grab whatever is underneath like Steve Irwin, and I see a TINY gecko. This this had probably just hatched and had gotten stuck in the box somehow. He was unharmed but in shock and not moving at all. I scooped him up on my finger and placed him outside on a tree so he could warm up. 

My manager thought it was hysterical, and I was told to check the boxes for more stowaways. 

They called me up the next day to deal with an equally confused wolf spider that had gotten into the returns cabinet.

Kelslaw,My favorite retail experience,"I worked retail for about 3 years and this is by far my favorite story. It's a happy one too, so don't get excited for anything crazy. I worked in the same retail store for about 2.5 years...so most of my stories will come from that.

On a busy Saturday I noticed a group of 3 people, so I went over and greeted them. There was a husband and wife and someone else with them. I quickly realized that the husband and wife were both deaf. The 3rd person was their translator. They were looking to buy an iPad because they thought it would help them with their communication.

I explained a lot of the features of the iPad to them and I also started discussing mobile hotspots with them (this was before you could do it on your phone easily). I ended up spending over an hour with them on a busy Saturday. I wrote down an entire page worth of information because they needed something to take home with them. They were the nicest couple, but they weren't ready to buy. I was actually chewed out my manager for spending so much time with them (they never believed customers were coming back).

They came back about a week later and bought everything I recommended to them. They were super excited and nervous, but we finished everything and it went relatively smoothly...that was a rare occurrence with our systems. Another one of my coworkers had talked to them before I did, but I was more thorough in the information I gave. They were used to people taking advantage of them because they were deaf, so I wanted to make sure they knew everything they needed to know. Funnily enough...their translator came back and bought stuff from me several months later because of how much I helped them.

So onto the best part...a couple of months later I'm at work and cleaning the iPad display and someone comes up and hugs me from behind. I was a little freaked out at first, but it was the wife. I turned around and she gave me a bigger hug. She kept thanking me because they were able to do so much with the iPad and it helped their communication. She could read lips so we talked for a minute and she gave me another big hug.

It honestly made me feel incredible. You never realize the impact you can have on people.",TalesFromRetail,1046,1506431007
Krackensantaclaus,I just got robbed at gunpoint,"I work as the overnight cashier at a local gas station. 

I was standing at the back of my store, talking with the manager, when the guy came in. I turned around to greet him, and saw his face was covered by a mask. Immediately started preparing for the worst. 

He took two steps, racked his gun (looked like a 9mm, but not super sure. I'm just judging that by the size of his gun compared to the one I had before it got stolen), stepped around the corner, made eye contact, and racked it again. 

I thought to myself, *""Ok, that sounded hollow, and that was the second rack... No round was ejected, he doesn't have ammo.""* My manager and I start walking towards the counter, and I hear him pull the slide again. *Ok... Hes definitely dry... We're safe.*

I hand him the money in the register, and he looks at it for a second. Then we have this short exchange. 

Him: ""I know you you've got more than this."" 
Me: ""No, that's all there is, unless you want the change, too."" 
Him: ""What about the other register?"" 
Manager: ""That one is empty at all times, unless there's a clerk working it.""

The robber turns and leaves the store. I've almost been working gas stations at night for 2 years now and this was the first time I've been robbed.

Edit: to those asking why I didn't call him out in not having bullets, because that's not how to handle the situation, especially with multiple lives at stake. Just because there weren't any bullets IN the gun, it doesn't mean he didn't have bullets at all.

jjb8712,“He told him to use my card!”,"Hi all. On mobile so excuse formatting please and thank you.

So I’m a bagger for a small grocery store chain, 10 stores all around a 25 mile radius in the East Coast. For this story, I’ll be Me, stupid lady will be SL, next customer will be NC.

On this fateful day a couple of months ago, I was bagging for this I would say middle aged lady. She, of course, had a problem with the way I bagged mostly everything, and said that numerous bags were too heavy. (On a side note, I’m sorry but if you can’t lift a grocery bag with 10 items in it you need to be in assisted living or have someone help you shop. Stores can not be handing out 20 paper/plastic bags for 20 items. I digress). 

So I guess bitching at me on how to do my job made SL leave her credit card next to the pin pad. Neither the cashier, the NC or I noticed it. I actually thought the NC had taken out his card and placed it down to put his items on the belt.

Unfortunately, the NC accidentally used the SL’s card. He quickly realized it and I took it up to the booth and said
“SL left her card and NC  accidentally used it. NC paid correctly but SL’s card needs to be debited the amount he accidentally paid”. 

I thought that was it, but with retail haha it never is. 2 hours later it was slowing down, and I see SL come in.

SL “I left my card here.”
Me: “Oh yes, it is up at the customer service booth.”

She rolls her eyes at me and 2 minutes later I hear screaming and my cashier and I weren’t busy so we listened in. The customer service rep told her what happened with the accidental purchase and that her card would be debited the full amount or whatever.

SL: “No! He (me) told the customer to use my card! I want him fired!”
Customer Service: “Ma’am, please keep your voice down. Neither the cashier or the bagger saw your card as they were focusing on the next customers item. We have already processed the transaction and you will pay $0 for this”.
SL: “I want a manager!”
Manager comes over and reiterated everything the customer service rep told her, but she was still insisting that I, a bagger trying to pay for college, would tell another customer to use someone else’s card, which would get me fired and probably in more trouble than that. 

After the ol’ “I’m never shopping here again” line, the manager basically just told her to shut up and leave. She gave me a dirty look on the way out. I hate people.

EDIT: To everyone who is confused about the guy using the ladies card. Let me try and explain it and paint the best visual in your mind as I can. I guess I should have specified with what this guy looked like. He was probably in his 50’s. He is behind the lady and is putting his stuff on the belt. He goes to pay, inserts his card, and since he used it as credit he just has to sign his name. He goes to put the card away and says “wait this isn’t my card!” and sees his card is in his wallet. I don’t know if he had memory loss or something, but I was just as confused as you all were.",TalesFromRetail,1869,1506360056

Ginge_unleashed,The Unfixable Pink DS Lite,"Hi Guys, 

First time post here, hopefully the first of many. I've had a few jobs in retail, this particular one comes from my first ever job.

I was working for a store in the UK that sold games, consoles, accessories, and the like. 

It was just after Christmas 2006, the year of the pink DS Lite; trying to get hold of a pink DS Lite that year was like Arnold trying to get a Turbo-Man in ""Jingle All the Way"". The people that managed to get one were the lucky few. Anyway, a few days after Christmas a man comes into the store carrying a pink DS, he had quite a thick eastern European / Russian accent, which led my colleagues to refer to him as the crazy Russian dude in future retellings of this event. CRD = crazy Russian dude, ME = me

&gt; CRD: I bought a DS for my daughter for Christmas and it won't play any of her games

&gt; ME: Okay, let me take a look at it and I will see if I can sort it. 

So, I take the DS off CRD and take it into the back of the store to test it with some of our games, in case it was the games that were faulty and not the DS. I tried 3 or 4 games and none of them worked, so the DS is obviously faulty. There's no apparent damage to the console and as the stock doesn't belong to me personally, I also don't really care why it's not working and so tell the manager I'm going to swap it for the customer. 

My manager okayed it and off I went to grab one, except, we haven't got any in stock. I rang the other store nearby, and when I say nearby, I mean it's in the same building, maybe a 45-second walk away; they've just had a delivery of 30 and put one aside for me. I return to the customer, pink DS Lite in hand.

&gt; ME: Hi, yeah, seems to be totally done in.

&gt;CRD: so, what are you doing to sort it.

&gt;ME: As you've only had it for a few days I would swap it, however, we haven't got any in stock, so -

&gt;CRD: *roars, then grabs DS out of my hands, opens it way past fully open, snaps all the hinges, pulls it apart, throws it on the floor and storms off out the store*

&gt;ME (to colleague): erm, what the fuck just happened?

&gt;Colleague: I dunno, but he's been walking up and down the store since you went in the back.

Now the rare pink DS Lite is completely broke, and CRD's daughter is going to have to do without because he didn't let me finish my sentence. ",TalesFromRetail,1784,1506262240
timethrow95,Buying Alcohol in School Uniform.,"This is probably my favourite all-time story from retail.

I was working an early morning shift (6-4) as a Team Leader in a Supermarket, for context here in the UK you have to be 18 to buy Alcohol or Tobacoo.

I was looking after the Self Service Checkouts (as it was around 7.40 and the next person was in at 8) and a group of school kids come in and proceed to get what they want (Sweets, Fizzy Drinks etc) and they all wait at the end for each other.

One kid comes up and use the till closest to me and proceeds to scan a bottle of Vodka, I realise (and the Till Prompts) and I go over and tell him he cant have it. The conversation was something like this Me+Me, K=Kid, DM=Duty Manager.

&gt;M: Sorry, I'm afraid you cant purchase this as you are underage.

&gt;K: Nah I'm not

&gt;M: Sorry you're in school uniform, which means at the most you are 16 years old.

&gt;K: and what

&gt;M: You are not allowed to buy this, and im not legally allowed to sell it to you.

&gt;K: Im 18

&gt;M: You are in School Uniform, I don't believe your 18.

&gt;K: I am

&gt;M: I'm sorry I don't believe you.

&gt;K: You never asked for ID.

&gt;M: Correct, I would ask for ID had you not been in school uniform, however I know the school you goto (previously went there) and I know that you only go there until your 16. You are not allowed this alcohol, I suggest you either pick something else or you leave.

&gt;K: Yeah I will leave with this bottle.

&gt;M: That's not going to happen, I'm afraid.

&gt;K: I also want a pack of baccy, and some papers.

&gt;M: Again, you are not overage and you are in school uniform, you are not having any Alcohol, or Tobacco, you can purchase anything else that you are allowed like your friends have or you can leave.

&gt;K: You cant make me leave.

&gt;M: Yes we can, its your choice what happens, however, if you continue to argue here, I will call for the Duty Manager and you will be escorted out of the store.

&gt;K: Your a f***ing tosser, just f**k off.

&gt;M: You need to leave now.

The Kid then proceeds to leave with his bunch of mates, i think nothing much of it and report it in our ""Incident"" book and inform the Security Guard when he arrives.

Later that day the Duty Manager comes up to me.

&gt;DM: I have just had an angry woman phone the store, and they have put a formal complaint in about you.

&gt;M: Really, What was it regarding, I have not had any issues today that would cause a complaint.

&gt;DM: She says her son was in here earlier trying to buy a couple of drinks with his friends before school, and you were abusive and aggressive towards him, then proceeded to start singling him out and begin verbally assaulting him, and refusing to serve him.

&gt;M: *Sighs*, well he was bout 14-15 in full School Uniform from (Local School) and was trying to buy a bottle of Vodak, his mates were at the end of the Tills waiting for him, he did not like the fact that he could not buy it, and tried to claim he was 18. After trying that he also asked for some Tobacco, which was also declined, when told he was not getting he then proceeded to be abusive towards me.

&gt;DM: When did it happen, so we can check CCTV as his mother claims something completely different.

Duty Manager, checks CCTV which backs up the story, proceeds to call the Mother back, who insisted we were covering up, and that he (precious little) son would never try and buy alcohol or tobacco and that she was going to phone Customer Services to report us both.


Nothing ever came of it after that, but it never amazes me the Cheek of some people and how far some are willing to go.

I am M, she is L, her husband is H

L: Oh, shoot, I wanted cash back. Can I still do that?

Her transaction had not gone through yet, she just needed to redo the card.

M: Absolutely. You'll just need to pull your card out and redo it.

L, looking at the card reader : before or after I do the pin?

M: You will need to pull it out without entering your pin. If you put your pin in, the transaction will go through and you won't be able to get cash back.

L stares at the card reader for a while before entering pin. Based on the faces she was making, I assumed she decided not to worry about it, as plenty of people do. As the receipt prints out,

L: okay, so how do I get cash back?

M: I'm sorry?

L: I want cash back.

M: Ma'am, I'm sorry, but you paid for your stuff when you put your pin in.

L: I was waiting for your to tell me how to get cash back.

M: I told you to take your card out to get cash back.

H: don't worry about it, L. We will stop at the bank on the way home.

Seriously? How was that not clear?

CuttlefishBenjamin,What did she think was happening?,"A year or so ago, at the newsstand where I work, a customer came in search of orange juice.  My friend was working the counter when she came up, and the following exchange occurred...

Customer: Do you have orange juice?

Friend:  Yes, we do!  It's right in the top of that cooler behind you.

Customer, after glancing at cooler:  No.  *Orange juice*.

Friend: Yes ma'am.  Orange juice.  It's on the top shelf of that cooler.

Customer:  *No.*  **Orange.  Juice.**

Second Customer, retrieving orange juice from cooler:  It's right here, ma'am.

Customer:  Oh, thank you.

And then she bought the orange juice and left.

Catheo-ShatteredHand,"The typical ""I'll never shop here again""","So I work in a well known tile store.

As most hardware/renovation shops do we take orders on deposit.
Meaning you can pay a deposit (generally done during sales to hold the sale price)

So a couple of weeks ago a ""gentleman"" enters the shop, pays a deposit on his order.


His total order was €384.78. He paid a €200 deposit, leaving the remaining balance at €184.78.

This week he returns for his order.

Customer will be C, I will be Me.

C- ""I'm here to collect my order""

Me- ""Ok, have you got your receipt with you""

C- ""Yes"" *hands me receipt*

Me- ""Ok, there is a balance of €184.78 on that""

C- ""No there isn't!""

Me- ""Just let me check the computer"" 

(sometimes they come back and pay more just don't bring the updated docket)

Me- ""Our system shows that the amount owing is €184.78""

C- ""I don't care what it says, I'll give you €184""

Me- ""I'm sorry sir, but I cannot adjust the bill once the order has been processed, If a discount was to be applied it would have had to be at the time of purchase.""

C- ""I go to [Insert store name here] and they would always discount the couple of cents.""

Me - ""I'm sorry but we are not [Insert store name here].

(I know full well that he is lying as the store he mentioned, would never discount anything for anyone, even the staff don't get a discount)

C- ""I was told when I paid my the deposit that i wouldn't have to pay the €0.78""

Me- ""I'm sorry sir, but I know you weren't told that as I was the one who processed the original transaction.""

C- ""No you weren't, you are lying and I'm not paying the €0.78""

(At this point I start getting a little agitated, as our receipts clearly print out the name of the sales rep who processed the transaction. So I point this out to him)

C- ""Well then you must have told me, just take it off the bill""

Me- ""Sir as I have said I cannot discount it, you have to pay the outstanding on your bill or I cannot release the goods.""

C-""Fine here"" *Shoves card in my face* ""I'll never shop here again you miserable little s--t""

(At this point I am quite taken aback by this)

C-""I go [Insert store name here] and [Insert store name here] and they always discount the cents off the end, you are just greedy""

Me- ""Sir, I don't own this company, so it does not benefit me whether or not I charge you the €0.78 or not""

C- ""Why can't you just discount it then?""

Me- ""I have already explained that several times to you.""

C- ""This is ridiculous""

Me- ""Do you go to your local supermarket and ask them to discount the odd cents from the end of your bill?""

C- ""No, but this is different""

Me- ""Sir, there is no difference, we are a retail store, just like them.""

**Silence**

(I wander off to collect his order and load it for him, finally loaded into his van)

Me- ""Have a nice day, see you again"" (general response, force of habit)

Me: I've looked the vehicle up on my internal system, and it has never been to this dealership before. Unfortunately I cannot verify who you are over the phone.  
Customer: that's not my problem. I'll give you the VIN and you give me the code.  
Me: again sir, as I can't verify who you are, I will not be able to give you the code. May I suggest......(he then cuts me off)  
Customer: I suggest you learn how to actually provide ""customer service"". How bloody stupid are you?  
Me: Not stupid enough to give a code over the phone. And, as I was going to suggest, perhaps you could drive your vehicle to us, I can verify a few details and give you the code. However, due to your rudeness, I will not assist you when you come in, and neither will my Service Manager either.  
Customer: you can't do that! You are the closest dealership.

en256,Every angry customer's worst nightmare: total indifference,"I watch over the self-checkouts at my store. 

For a bit of background, my store has two sets of circulars with coupons people can get. One you have to sign up for and it gets mailed to your house. The other we have stacks of in our store that anyone can take. The one you get in the mail often has a coupon to get you two times as many rewards points which can be used to save on gas.

So on this day a woman came through self-checkout and at the end of her order she brought her mail flier up to me and asked me to scan her double points coupon. So I scan it and start tearing it out when she asks me to give it back to her so she could use it another time.

I told her I can't do that and have to take it from her after it's been used, even pointing out the text saying ""LIMIT 1 PER HOUSEHOLD"" on the coupon. But she starts arguing with me saying I *can* do it and that she does it all the time. I happen to see our store manager walking by so I flag him down to come help me out.

As I expected he tells her pretty much the exact same thing. I don't remember everything that was said but this is pretty much how it went:

&gt;Store manager (to me): What seems to be the issue?

&gt; Lady: I just asked him to-

&gt; SM: Hold on let me hear his side first. What's going on?

&gt; Me: She wants me to give back her double points coupon after I already scanned it for her. It says limit one per household on it though.

&gt; SM: It does say limit one per household. He has to keep it and be accountable for all his coupons.

&gt; L: But I do it all the time at [other location]! They even hand them out at the registers!

&gt; SM: Well they're not supposed to be doing that. 

&gt; Me: Yeah it's just company policy, we have to go by what the coupon says.

She argues some more, and the store manager says he'll go check the fliers we have stacked by the door to see if there's one in there she can have. We all know there won't be but he'll check anyway.

So at this point she's still with me while I'm trying to help people at self-checkout.

&gt; L: You know, the whole reason I shop at [store] is for the savings I get on gas.

&gt; Me: ok

&gt; L: I mean, really, I just spent $150 here.

&gt; Me: ok

&gt; L: But honestly after this I don't think I'm going to shop here anymore. 

&gt; Me: ok

&gt; L: \*looks at nametag\* No, *[MY NAME]*, don't just stand there and say okay!

&gt; Me: ...ok

&gt; L: Can't you just give my coupon back?! They really let me do this all the time

&gt; Me: no, sorry

I crumple up the coupon to hopefully make it more clear to her that it isn't going to happen. Store manager comes back and of course there wasn't another coupon in the circulars by the door. He asks her to come to the service desk with him and they'll see if there's anything we can do.

I thought that would be the last of it but I work in retail so of course it's not.

About 10 minutes later she comes back to me with one of the circulars from the door and shoves it in front of the screen I'm trying to do my job with. 

&gt; L: I just want you to know that all of these coupons in here say one per household too.

&gt; Me: ok

&gt; L: Yeah but I bet you just zap them with your gun all the time and let people keep them!

&gt; Me: ok

&gt; L: You know what? Where's the boss? Call him over again!

So I pick up the phone to call him and as I'm talking to him she just walks away. Store manager comes down a few seconds later asking where she is and I shrug telling him she walked away. I tell him the general direction she went and he goes to look for her. He didn't find her.

I heard from one of my coworkers that the next day a woman matching her description came in asking cashiers at the registers if they had any double points coupons in their drawer.

flamingwonder,"She couldn't wait 30 minutes, so she ended up waiting 5 hours","I used to work in the print center within a retail store. One morning I got a call 5 minutes before open, asking for a couple of posters to be printed within the hour. There were also a couple of email orders which needed to be done. Since it was first come, first serve, I made these my priority. A lady walks in ten minutes after open wanting invitations printed. 

Lady: I would like these invitations printed and cut right away please. 

Me: That will take me about 30 minutes, I have a couple of projects ahead of you. You can walk around the store and wait or come back later to pick them up if you'd like. 

Lady: Why can't they be done right now? 

At this point I reiterate myself, trying to explain that there are other customers waiting on their projects to be completed. Of course, she starts arguing with me anyway. 

Just as she becomes more agitated, the MOD walks by to pick up an item for another customer in the store. The lady asks her if she's the manager, and asks how long her invitations would take to complete. The MOD asks me what my workload is, and I tell her I have two other projects needing to be done asap, so it will be about 30 minutes. The MOD tells the woman the same thing I said and walks back to her other customer. This lady is fuming that the manager walked away from her, yells at me some more, then finally leaves the store. 

Jump to several hours later, and a man and his daughter come up to the counter wanting to have invitations printed. It's a busier time of day, and I tell them it will be about 30-45 minutes. The man agrees and says he will just walk around the store. I open the files and I recognize that they're the same invitations from the lady earlier. 

Me: Oh I recognize these. I think your wife was in earlier, I'm sorry I couldn't have them done sooner. 

Man: That's alright. She's my ex wife. 

And he walks off. I have the invitations done within the timeframe I had said, and the man comes back up to pay and ended up buying his daughter a whole bunch of things. 

TLDR; A woman absolutely could not wait half an hour for her invitations to be printed so she yells at me. She sends her ex husband in several hours later and he happily waits and buys his daughter a whole bunch of things. In the end she waited at least 5 hours to get her damn invitations. 

I've never had any other customer straight up yell at me before. I kept my calm and talked to her in my most ""customer service"" voice the entire time hoping she'd feel bad for yelling at me. I doubt she ever felt bad.

iamreeterskeeter,"You should let me take this expensive piece of unregistered, unpaid equipment home!","That moment when you fantasize punching a customer and your boss in the face.

I had a real pain in the arse customer come in today.  We are installing his tv system this Friday and for months, especially since he signed up last week, he has been coming in 3 times a week to ask me more questions.  That alone is annoying, but whatever.

Today he came in and said that he wanted to build a custom shelf for one of his receivers and wanted to look at the exact receiver we would be installing.  I showed him the store display and explained that it would look exactly like that one.

&gt;Customer: Can you give me the unit now so I can build the shelf?

&gt;Me:  I am sorry, but that isn't possible.  The product has not been purchased, is not registered to an account, and is not activated.

&gt;Customer:  ""You don't LOOK very sorry!""

Sigh.

I explained that I cannot allow unpurchased, unactivated, unattached equipment out of the store.  I just can't.  He told me he would give me $100.  No.

One of the owners was a few feet away helping another customer and butted in.  He said that we would be happy to give him a receiver.  It wasn't a big deal.  I pasted a small smile on my face, shot daggers out of my eyes, folded my hands primly in front of me, and walked silently to the back room.

I walked back to the showroom and asked the customer to have a seat while I write down the receiver numbers, serial numbers, etc.  
&gt;Customer: ""Oh, I didn't realize you were going to have to write down any information.""

&gt;Me: ""Look, I'll be really straight with you.  The main reason why I said no to giving this to you besides it being unpaid and unregistered, is that your equipment is still on order and I don't have any more stock currently.  I stole this off of another customer's order and now I will have to rewrite their paperwork as well.""

The customer shrugged and said, ""Eh, that's not a big deal.""  He took his prize and walked out of the store without a care in the world.  My boss came back over to me after finishing with his customer and apologized for butting in. I told him it was fine, his name is on the building and it's within his right to make that decision, BUT we didn't have a receiver to give that customer and I had to take it off of someone else's order.  The blood drained from his face and he was suddenly very, very contrite and started to apologize profusely.

The co-owner walked in shortly afterwards and we updated him on what happened earlier.  He. Was. Pissed.  However, he recognizes that his partner had the right to make the decision.

Pelinth,Inflation? Let me calculate that.,"Working at an outdoor furniture retail store, I get many customers who are polite, cunning and a tad bit arrogant. They most likely don't even realise it, but I'm okay with it as you take the majority good with the minority bad. Now I shall tell the tale:

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

On a quiet Thursday night, a young couple enters my store with a purpose to their stride. They immediately go to the dining setting that they would inevitably buy, but at a price that they would initially decline. Upon reaching their destination, they begin to carefully inspect the dining setting. Their actions and discussion confirmed my thought that they were serious customers, so thus began the half an hour interaction to close the sale.

&amp;nbsp;


After what seemed quite a while, the couple followed me to the counter where the sale would be finalised. Suddenly, the couple produced an invoice (from our company) of exactly the same furniture that they were supposedly to be buying.

With glee in his eyes, the man stated,

&gt; ""My parents bought this exact dining setting previously from this store, here's the invoice.""

Yet three key details were different; it was dated two years ago, the name was anothers and most importantly, the **price was lower than the discounted price that I quoted**. 

&amp;nbsp;

The couple had arrived with a game plan. They would act as first time customers, try to get a reasonable discount price that I could offer, then show that invoice for an additional discount.

&amp;nbsp;

I was only working at that store for around eight months, so I wasn't aware to what extent my company increases the RRP over the course of a few years. However, my company had a reputation for fantastic customer service and not screwing over the customer.

With that in mind, I replied,

&gt; ""Unfortunately, since that invoice was dated in 2015, I believe the price discreprancy is due to inflation. So I won't be able to give you a further discount, as the quoted price is the lowest I can realistically go without losing my job.""

The man scoffed,
&gt; ""I'm an accountant, if you can give me the calculator, I'll work out what the price of my parent's purchase would be with two years inflation.""

I was called out and there was nothing I could do about it but provide him with the calculator. He performed multiple rapid calculations and his fingers came to a stop. I peered over the counter and to my utter bewilderment, the digits displayed on the calculator was in the same hundreds as my quoted price!

With regretful eyes, he mumbled,
&gt;""Maybe I shouldn't have done that.""

I replied,
&gt;""If you tell me how you did that calculation, I'll throw in a free lazy susan.""

&amp;nbsp;

The rest of the sale transaction was fluid and lighthearted exchange ensued. After the sale was complete, we joked about what occurred, and we parted ways amicably, with a story to share.

&amp;nbsp;
