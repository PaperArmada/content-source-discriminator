MisterPuffyNipples,"What's your ""I give up"" story when working at a disorganized environment?","I'm not quitting. I'm just gonna go in and half ass everything. 


So I work for the archdiocese of my state (despite being an atheist lol) and I've been there now for 3 months. I have no IT background and do L1/L2 support. There was no training, there's no documentation, can't Google stuff because 90% of it is very specific situations for their garbage infrastructure, the senior techs hate me because in the beginning I kept asking questions and they're sick of it. 

One specifically was on the phone about maybe a month ago whispering to a friend about how much she hates me. I try to take notes and I have some but they explain things so fast it's hard to take proper notes. I have trouble absorbing information and really need notes

There's 3 or 4 senior techs depending on the day  and 5000 users. 

Here's a little about one scenario 


A user calls and says her desktop keeps locking when the computer isn't in use. The sleep settings are set to never. Users have laptops and desktops and sometimes they use the laptops to remote into their desktops. Passwords need to be changed every 90 days on the laptop and desktop and email. If they change it without being on the network the password won't sync to all these. 

In order to sync they need to either connect directly to the network or login to the watchguard  vpn (but they also need 2FA app for  to vpn) then ctrl alt del to lock the computer and in lock it with the new password. Anyway this one user is in the desktop so she's on the network. No need for vpn. Her password was reset in AD  by me because I ran out if ideas after trying the small amount of possibilities that I don't really understand. I keep unlocking her making her think the reset fixed it just so I can close the ticket

I don't want to to that but what else can I do

 I decided not to ask the senior techs because I give up. There's no support, no way to learn what's happening —if this is what IT is like I'm not interested",ITCareerQuestions,1,1646352687

Michaelscott304,Help deciding between 2 offers …I’m stressing out !,"I’m really undecided on what to do. My goal is to get into Azure / Devops . 

JOB 1 is a contract (with no definitive end) to work at Microsoft , through a third party contractor company .
$40/hr , no benefits (and I have a wife and kid who require insurance , so I’d be paying a few hundred per month  out of pocket). I’d Be doing some kind of azure support tickets (not help desk). It’s risky because while some people get converted to MS employees  , it could take a long time , if ever (I’ve heard 6months and I’ve also heard 18 months) . That being said, the experience is probably invaluable and Azure is EXACTLY where I want to be …

Job 2 is a 6 month contract to hire at a local and prestigious University… $45/hr and get benefits at 6months . Spoke with the manager and he intends on hiring me at six months, no games . Obviously the tech /experience isn’t as good as MS, but I’d be on the Infrastructure team , doing sys admin stuff . They do use Azure and are “looking to get into dev ops”.

I would love to do Microsoft but the contract scares me. I’m not sure if I could afford to pay out of pocket insurance for more than a few months (I was quoted at like $700 for the 3 of us).

Smug-Vulture,Recent Cloud/DevOps Engineering Job Hunting Experiences,"Throwaway because some people at my current job may know my reddit name but not know I am looking.

Here is a summary of what I have found in the 2mo I've been causally and more aggressively searching. I have several years of cloud engineering and DevOps experience.

* Applying on corporate career websites is a waste of time. You need to talk/email someone that is directly responsible for recruiting. I searched for large-ish organizations, highly rated larger companies on Glassdoor/Blind. I used their career website and applied to \~15 organizations one night.
   * 1 of them got back to me on their own, a week later. Slow scheduling
   * 2 of them showed no movement until I went WAY out of my way to find a recruiter that I could have a real conversation with. They were suddenly super excited to talk to me and I got interviews immediately after a chat with the hiring manager.
   * The remaining \~12 I am not super passionate about, so have not pursed. They haven't got back to me in about 3 weeks.
* LinkedIn is king these days. If you update your profile to be complete, throw the switch to ""casually considering offers"" or ""currently applying"" you will get flooded with LITERALLY dozens of chats per day from recruiters.
* Marked urgency on interview scheduling when you say you've already interviewed and are waiting on decisions, or already have an offer.
* Job titles are impossible to figure out. Literally the same skillsets under ""DevOps"" ""Cloud Engineer"" ""Software Engineer"" ""Infrastructure Engineer"" ""Systems Engineer"" interchanging at many companies. Really rough to do a career search for ""cloud"" on a corporate site and have to sift through 30 ""Software Engineer"" entries to find the one that is actually about cloud technologies.
* Everyone is looking for Kubernetes skills. If you think you might be moving soon, you should try to get this experience at your current company.
* Salary caps are stupid high right now. Know your worth.
* ""What are you salary expectations"" is the worst question to answer. I usually give them a real answer with a TON of caveats that give me room to negotiate after they make me an offer. Stuff like work-life balance, base vs bonus line, RSUs, etc. I may be making a mistake here, but I believe in being upfront.

Is anyone else experiencing similar? I was most surprised to find how worthless the career site application process was. I know my skills are a perfect fit for every role I applied for and my resume represents me well, but still, radio silence. Must be recruiters overworked or just too many applicants.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1646350298

I am a Sr. Full Stack dev doing technical panel interviews with prospective candidates.  So far every candidate we've interviewed has been calling themselves full stack devs on their resumes, listing all kinds of modern front end tools and frameworks, but then admit to us point blank that they don't do front end when given even the most basic questions about JS.

Stop doing this.  It makes you look bad and wastes everyone's time.  Don't put Angular on your resume if you haven't built anything with it, yourself.  Leading projects where other people wrote Angular SPAs doesn't count.  You need *hands on keyboard* experience.  

I get that you want the title and salary but you need to *work* for it.  You cannot call yourself full stack unless you know the full stack, and can handle standing up an entire web application up yourself.  You are not doing yourselves any favors by lying.  

We *will* find out and we *won't* give you a callback.  If you were simply honest about your qualifications we might have recommended you for a back end dev spot, but because you lied you're getting ghosted and removed from the rolodex.

Think_Mess_517,"Unemployed for a year after college, finally got amazing opportunity","Hey Reddit.

I wanted to write this post as a thank you and to share my experience in the terrible climate that is today’s job search.  I graduated college in December 2020 with an Information Technology degree, I must have applied to 100 jobs a week through Indeed and various other job searching platforms.  I applied to everything; entry level, mid-level, help desk, software side, hardware side, cloud engineer roles, etc.  (If it had anything to do with Linux or Python then I applied to it).  For months and months, I got nothing except rejection emails, it was extremely defeating to the point where I questioned my ability to even do basic tasks.  Eventually, around August (After 8 months of applications), I finally received an email asking for an interview with my local county for a role in support.  I felt so defeated from the months of rejection, I didn’t think I could actually do the interview, let alone the job, so I declined the interview.  I remember my parents were so confused as to why I turned it down, and to be completely honest I was confused as well.  After so many applications and months of rejection, impostor syndrome just sets in deeper and deeper.  

I continued to apply to jobs after that, thinking I’d be stuck in this loop for the rest of my life.  A few months go by and then in November I get an email from a role I applied to thinking there was no way I’d get it, a role where I thought my application wouldn’t even be read by a real human.  They wanted me for a Zoom interview and I almost turned them down the same way back in August, but I pushed myself to do the interview.  The role was for a Software Engineer, I studied for a week straight for the interview; memorizing lines, practicing what I’d say to questions in the car, in front of the mirror, with my parents.  I did the interview and it went surprisingly well, especially for my first actual interview ever.  I got a call from them a week later saying that the role wasn’t a good fit for me, but they’d give me another interview with a different department.  I do the second interview, this time for a DevOps Engineering position.  It went better than the first, though I didn’t expect anything to come of it.  A week later they said they wanted to continue with a third interview, but after the holidays had passed.  I was excited but I had to wait a month before I even heard anything back, it was rough, and that impostor syndrome set back in quickly.  

In January I emailed the interviewer I spoke with who told me I should be hearing from a recruiter soon.  Eventually I did hear back from a recruiter, but not with an offer for a third interview.  In early February I received an offer for an entry level DevOps position with a Fortune 500 company, relocation assistance provided, great benefits and more money than I thought I would ever make at 21.  I was so shocked when they offered me the position, I had been turned down from so many positions throughout the year, positions that require a lot less experience, and positions that paid a lot less.  Even now, a few weeks before I relocate, I am still in disbelief that I have this opportunity.  I am confident I can perform optimally at this position, but I am still very nervous.  

It was an extremely long and painful road to get here.  Constantly feeling like I’m not good enough, constantly feeling like a deadbeat, constantly being rejected, constantly reading “We have carefully reviewed your qualifications and have decided to pursue other candidates”.  The job search is a soul crushing experience, one I thought I’d never get out of.   I just wanted to thank this community, and share my experience.  I haven’t posted here before; I didn’t even realize this sub existed until a very special person told me about it.  That person helped me through so many rough times this year, and though we don’t talk much anymore, if you’re reading this then thank you.  I am excited to start this opportunity, even though I may be out of my depth at first, I am not going to hold myself back anymore.  So, if there is anything I want people to take away from this post, its that just because a job rejects you, it doesn’t mean you aren’t good enough for it.  Keep applying, keep applying to roles you don’t think you’re 100% qualified for, keep on trying and don’t give up on yourself.  If you have any questions, I would be more than happy to answer them.  Thank you for reading this long and drawn-out post.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1646347935

DevilDogg22,Right Certification track for Security Engineer role?,"Background: 

BA in Computer and Network Security (2018)  
Almost 3 years as a Sysadmin  
CCNA obtained early 2021  
8 months as a Network Engineer

So I'm coming around to 4 years in the IT world. Networking is where I wanted to be and I'm there. I spent a lot of time from 18 all through my 20's in a LEO role so very security minded. I think getting into a security roll would be ideal. It would be heavily involved in the networking aspect but also deal with endpoint security as well. 

I'm in a role now where they are very open to allowing us to grow into other positions and have already discussed my interest in Security. Was told it could be in the cards, but no immediate need for one. My current manager, I trust. This place has been nothing but awesome and very helpful when it comes to family and flex.

Then I thought about CEH, but read a review on it last night that kind of made me rethink it, but it's still on the table. My next thought was CISSP, I'm only a few months away from 4 years Experience and with my degree could get a waiver for that final year, but wondering if this is too advanced at this point? But then I looked at the SSCP and it says this is a good start for  Network Security Engineers, but what is the comparison to SSCP and Sec+?

AltAccBcMyGfStalksMe,I am stuck between two job offers and don’t know what to do,"Hi Reddit,

I am in a severe job predicament right now, currently I am a independent contractor making good money ($50/hr) helping clients with assemblies of various stuff from closets to dressers to mounting TVs etc. 

I’ve always had IT ambition and went to school for it, I have a bachelors in IT as well as a A+, Net+, Sec+

One year now after graduating, I’ve been looking to get into IT, I’ve had a brief internship in high school but besides that no It experience what so ever only education. 

I’ve been somewhat looking for jobs but nothing too aggressive, and I had an interview with a big corporate company supporting military operations as well for a network communications engineer role. The phone interview went rather okay, they told me about how they use Cisco equipment a lot and I nailed all net and sec+ related questions but they omitted all the Cisco ones since they know I have no experience with cisco what so ever. After the interview they told me that they liked what I had to say (the professional fluff blah blah) and that they would be contacting me by next week of their decision. 

I haven’t heard back from them in 2-3 weeks. 

I’ve been progressing at that point looking at other places and found a small business that was interested in my resume for a pc help desk tier 1 job; they reached out to me I had a phone interview, and then an in person interview. I would say both of these went very well and based on what I was told there are lots of opportunities to grow. I see myself enjoying the work environment there but I would be starting off help desk which I never did but tried to avoid since it is super entry level. At the end of the night they sent me an email saying they really enjoyed my interview and how they want me to send them a simple video demonstrating some abilities like resetting a password etc. and that after that a job offer is very near (the recruiter for that company added that)

Now to my big problem, the morning after the first company I applied for that never got back to me had a recruiter reach out to me saying that she wants to give me an offer from that corporate company and that they would like to hire me. It amazes me that a month later they decide to contact me when the dude on the phone interview said next week…i called and was told the offer would be $29/hr full time which is way more than the tech support help desk job would ever give me. Based on my area I would be expecting between $14-17 from that small business per hour. 

I really enjoyed the small business interview and the work environment but At almost half the pay and a much more entry level title I am conflicted on going with that, I would be spending a long time trying to get where I want to be to even get close to the same job offer that the other company just gave me…

I told the big company asking if I could have until Monday or Tuesday the latest to hear back from if I want to accept it, they said absolutely no problem and that’s where I am today. 

Based on my experience, I feel like I would be joining the corporate job and work hard to try and stay alive, vs the entry level job where I would need to work hard to get anywhere.

So far I haven't really been enjoying the job however. Pay is low (I took a 3 dollar per hour cut from retail to come here) and there is so much they expect me to know. I work with 2 other people and one of them has done this job for about 30 years, so they know every process and know how anything works like the back of their hand. There isn't really a knowledge base, and what is documented is a few years old and not relevant anymore.

The other 2 techs have been helpful in trying to teach me what I need to know, but I can tell they are getting frustrated with me when I mess up a ticket or some other issue. Since it's a goverment job there is a lot of bureaucracy and red tape about how exactly to do even basic tasks in AD like a password reset or whatnot.

It's basically just a glorified call center job, as I don't do anything but make a ticket for techs to go and work on. The only thing I'm even allowed to do is a basic password reset and even then I'm not trusted a whole lot.

I'm trying to get a new job ASAP which I hear is hard to do without experience. I need an entry level job that can train me but I've never worked help desk or IT before so I'm wondering if you guys have any  home lab projects I can work on that look really good on a resume and can serve as experience.

And what's a good place to look for entry level IT jobs in my area. Indeed, LinkedIn and Monster are givens, I'm just wondering if there's any other really good sources. I don't wanna miss out on anything or limit myself.

I'm determined to do anything I can to get myself looking hireable within a month or too. Perhaps too ambitious and unrealistic but maybe that fire and drive is extra energy that will boost my work towards getting these qualifications. 

Thanks in advance!   I appreciate any effort to help :)",ITCareerQuestions,1,1646332975
Luna_Crios,Net+ or CCNA? Hearing mixed reviews on each so I am still unsure which one would be best for Entry Level (sorry for another cert question),"I was studying for the A+ and decided not to take it and just focus on Net+ or CCNA. I keep hearing the pros and cons of each and am still confused which one to focus on. I know Net+ is more fundamentally based and non-vendor specific but the CCNA is supposedly regarded as much better, takes longer to study for and requires a greater depth of knowledge yet can yield better job opportunities. I keep hearing only go CCNA and that the Net+ is a garbage cert but then some say Net+ is regarded as a great cert and should be taken before the CCNA. Any advice on choosing one over the other?

I did a full-stack bootcamp last year, just built my homelab, I am familiar with Windows, Mac and Linux (still learning CLI) OS and currently working to expand my networking knowledge beyond the intro OSI and TCP/IP. Right now, I am applying to entry level Tech Support/Help Desk jobs and hopefully land something to ""break into the industry"", but if I want to eventually end up in a Networking role, should I take the Net+ then the CCNA or just jump to the CCNA and grind it out?

I figured study time for Net+ would be about 2 months and the CCNA would be more like 6 months so if I am starting out, should I just get the Net+ first, build that knowledge, get the cert to secure a job and then worry about the CCNA?",ITCareerQuestions,1,1646329520

Lost-Pitch420,A quick rant about folks who want to skip helpdesk and go straight to engineering roles,"I see so many folks on this sub who ask questions similar to ""how can I become a pentester/cloud engineer/network engineer in 6 months or less with no experience or certifications"" my answer to that question is you can't, it's simply not possible to learn all of the skills you would need to know to perform well in that short amount of time. No bootcamp or certification (while they are useful) is going to give you every skill that you will need to perform well at those jobs. You need to start on helpdesk or as a network technician or something similar. No company is going to hire somebody to manage (much less design) their critical network, cloud, or security infrastructure who doesn't even have experience supporting said applications or infrastructure. I know a guy who got his CCNA, Security+, and Aws solutions architect certs with no experience and he currently works on the helpdesk. Couldn't get callbacks for a network engineering position because he didn't have helpdesk experience. ALMOST everybody starts on helpdesk. Just because you have a CS degree, or a bunch of other certs, doesn't mean you are above the helpdesk. Get the experience, even a year or two's worth of helpdesk experience plus all your certs is enough to get interviews is enough to be considered for most junior level sysadmin or network admin jobs. My end goal is to be a cloud security engineer, but I have learned that in order to secure these systems, you have to understand how to build them, how they work, how they break, how to fix them when they do break, and how to prevent them from breaking in the future. I know it sounds shitty, but helpdesk really isn't all that bad and you can find some pretty decently paying jobs on the helpdesk.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1646327794

SwashbucklinChef,"My company just offered well below market rate for my ""promotion""","I've been working in healthcare IT for about 4 years now. I started with no experience and only got the position because I was already working for the organization in another department and the IT team was short staffed and desperate for anyone with a pulse. Needless to say my starting wage was low. In the 4 years I've been here I've educated myself on the ins and outs of our environment, earned a couple MCSAs (back when that was still a thing), and as of last year started at the local community college to get a software development degree. Each year I got the highest raise my organization would offer... 3%. We just got a new guy who makes $4 more an hour than I do. He's nice enough and he's about the same level of experience in this field as do, maybe a little less. I don't begrudge him for this but... it stings.

Finally in a stroke of luck I found out our team's developer will be going on an extended leave of absence for 8 months and they've asked me to be the interim developer. Fantastic! I'll hold a job in the field I'm getting my degree in before I even get the degree! After about a month of my boss going back and forth with HR and my department's finance team about compensation I finally hear back. I asked for $65,000 but was willing to settle for $60,000 which from I understood is about average for an entry level developer my area. My department's finance and admin team agree and shoot it up to whomever the head of the company's HR team... who then promptly shoots it down. They offer me 10% more than what I'm currently making which be roughly $20,000 less than what I was asking for.

I'm trying not to take it as a slap in the face but the offer hurts my pride and hurts more because I want to accept it. I don't graduate for two more semesters and it'll at least be experience on my resume. I hear that landing your first job as a new dev is always the hardest but after that when you have hands on experience its much easier. HR is trying to sell this to me as an ""opportunity"" and in the long run I can see this being just that... but it really hits me where it hurts the most to even be considering this.

I'll put a TLDR down below.

So I work as a cop and seriously burnt out and want to leave. A lot of things in LE I don't agree with and don't want to keep doing... Anyways moving on...

I use to work as an Office 365 support engineer for about a year and half before I left to go back into law enforcement back in October. (Company was shutting down and I needed a job so I went back to LE as that's what I previously did).

Anyways, that was a mistake and I'm regretting my decision. 

What options do I have with my experience as an Office 365 support engineer? I was looking at going back into O365 support at either Sherweb or Experis for another year or so to get that 2-3 year experience requirement that a lot of jobs require for to work as a consultant.

Would this be a good idea. Or does anyone else have any other recommendations? I'm in the Wisconsin area. I would also be going back to school to do competence based learning to get my bachelor's degree. (Have an associate's in CJ)

 I've been doing IT stuff for years myself. Have a lot of experience with O365, windows and a bit with Powershell.

My issue is that I realized a few days ago that I did not list my previous position at my current employer on my resume.

I listed accurate dates for which I was working there, but they are not accurate to how long I've had my current title.

Part of the reason I got promoted into my current role was because I was spending most of my time writing atomation code. So, to a certain degree I was already working as a programmer anyways.

jboyle4eva,A year into taking on my first network engineering role: somehow became a team leader with no pay raise,"Hey all,

I am employed through a vendor by one of the bigger tech companies for 3 years this month. I joined them as a Project Coordinator in a Network Deployment team and I felt this was a great entry role to gaining some experience in the network engineering world without being an engineer. My boss in this role knew I eventually wanted to move into an engineering role and our employer had a junior role open up about a year ago. I interviewed and got offered the role.

I joined a ""follow the sun"" team of 12 or so, with me and 3 others based in Dublin, Ireland working shifts during our local 8AM to 4PM. There were two experienced engineers on our team and one other guy joined externally the same time as me.

We ""manage"" a secondary network separate from the production network. There were plans when we joined to lease capacity on this network to third parties. It's been incredibly slow on this front, with most of our time spent doing operations work. I've since realised over time I won't be doing any configuration or deployment work. I had asked my manager on this team when I started if I could pursue starting a CCNA or similar which he was supportive of. One of our senior engineers was being a great mentor to me. 

However, our team structure has had challenges. Our two senior engineers both left within 4 months of me joining. I lost my mentor and for about 2 months, we only had myself and the other guy who joined with me during my local shift.

Any time to develop my skills during this time was non existent. I pretty much had to use all my working hours doing tasks.

We eventually got two new hires in. At this point, my manager asked me to take on the team lead role for Dublin. This was in October. I had only been in this role about 7 months, but he asked me based on my tenure with our employer.

I've taken on this role and frustratingly, despite my repeated requests, my salary has not been reviewed. I'm also leading a team with one guy who repeatedly causes us issues. Most of my day is spent correcting his work, almost like his babysitter.

I feel like my own development has taken a backseat, any time I want to do on the clock development is no longer an option. I have to facilitate giving the other guys opportunity to grow in their roles as the lead. By the time the day is done with the team and meetings with the US management teams, I'm wiped.

I think now is a time I want to look for another role elsewhere, I'm no longer happy doing more work for the same part. I'm not sure how to explain to a future employer how I can find myself a year into a role without anything like credentials to show them, or that I gained team lead experience but I'm probably not looking for leadership in my next role. 

Would anyone have any advice on what steps I can take to move on successfully?",ITCareerQuestions,1,1646268517

LeBurnerAcct,"Struggling to make decisions about job offers, help!","First and foremost I'd like to say I'm grateful for this community, without it I'd not be in the predicament I'm in currently. Secondly, let me say that I've never been in this situation before (always desperate for a callback and took whatever was offered) it feels good, but weird, but good to be asking this as I've been very fortunate to be in this situation and don't take it lightly. With that said let us begin!

I currently have four job offers (two verbal, two not yet but almost 100% assured based on how the interviews went and the wording from the hiring manager on the second round). I am just re-entering IT with a bit of experience under my belt, entering back in a junor/entry level capacity and am unsure what to pick, I'll outline the companies and hope to get some feedback on ""what would you do?"".

**All the jobs are essentially the same role but titles vary (IT Customer Support, Data Analyst, IS Support, etc)**

**Pros**:

* *Company A (Offer in Hand) (5/8 Hourly):* Local, insanely high Glassdoor reviews. Great company culture/community and vibe. One of the best-rated and reviewed companies I've ever seen, everyone approves of the CEO and they genuinely seem to mean it. The vibe there is great from what I can tell. Have been eye'n them for months due to this fact.
* *Company B (Offer in Hand) (4/10 Hourly):* Fully remote, high Glassdoor reviews but not many specific to this role so harder to feel out. Unsure of company culture but they did a massive layoff 7yr ago without notifying many people and that says something to me (financially sound company, I guess just restructuring) but the manager I would report to seems pretty cool.
* *Company C (Offer expected within the week) (5/8 Hourly):* Fully remote, W2 Contractor, mixed reviews but more good than bad. Longstanding company with a large presence in its sector.
* Company D  *(Offer expected within the week) (Salaried):* Smaller company (10 or so) with a 10yr record that services mostly local development/design/hosting contracts) who lost two critical people. Based on the brutally honest conversation I had with the CEO/Owner and Senior Salesperson it was due to the fact they refuse to go Hybrid for one, and the other graduated w/an MS in CS and left the state for better offers (which he had communicated). They're in a bit of a pickle and are in need (my city doesn't offer many tech opportunities, I'm the only coder I know if that gives an idea), they fully communicated they need ""above and beyond"" workers not ""9 to 5'rs"" and will be expecting 5-6d in the office 8-12hr/d a week.

**Cons:**

* Company A: None that I'm aware of aside from being the lowest waged offer. If I'm factoring in healthcare benefits which are the best I've ever seen, I could easily consider this an $18/hr job.
* Company B: Nothing that I'm aware of but would be likened more so to a ""call center helpdesk"" role, even though they're all basically that. They expressed interest in promotion and relocation to Home Office if performance benchmarks are met within a year. I have no interest in moving but if the money was good enough, I'd consider it potentially, but we're talking 2-3x to do so.
* Company C: Only that the reviews are mixed, otherwise I am unsure of any, and it's a w2 Contract, which comes with its own set of pros/cons. I'd prefer stability and healthcare.
* Company D: I would be working a LOT which is good and bad, I'm still relatively young, but I've heard (directly from the Sales lead) that the CEO is a bit of a ""no downtime, idle hands"" kinda guy. There are cameras in the offices so he can remotely monitor when not in the office. I believe I could negotiate hybrid since he lost someone before due to this and I live literally 5min from the office and can be there at a moment's notice. The owner is ""military man type"" and expects things a certain way, with a certain structure... but again... they're kinda hurting right now (due to my local tech scene, LinkedIn prem showed me only 13 applicants). Sounds like a halfway crappy place to be with no ""formal"" HR or accountability, but the wages could offset this.

**Wages:**

* Company A: ($17/hr great benefits nearly all premiums covered)
* Company B: (19.25/hr typical benefits structure)
* Company C: ($20/hr no benefits structure)
* Company D: (typical benefits structure) ( Wages A little trickier) I think I can negotiate at least $55-60k/yr given I'll be doing way more than the actual title implies and they're in absolute dire straits right now which gives me leverage). I would be exposed to way more than just my role given my background in Design/Development and server experience. I'd be exposed to all of this not merely support. The owner is looking to retire in a year or two and I think I could re-negotiate at that time for more potentially (unless the company goes under in that time or he sells it).

**Questions and additional notes:**

* Does the title actually matter if the roles and responsibilities on my resume are essentially the same when I attempt to pivot n to higher-paying more ""senior"" roles as I progress?
* Company B needs a response ASAP as onboarding is expected in two to three weeks and they want time to get the BG check and all that stuff done, I don't want to rush things but I understand their need.
* Company A is cool with me taking a few days to decide (didn't express that I'm weighing other jobs, obviously).
* Which would you pick? what stands out the most to you? any advice in making this decision?

*To me A is the best place to work vibe-wise, but lowest paying. B is second-best potential and I think I could learn a thing or two, D whilst being the most challenging and most hours could potentially (keyword is potentially) net me way higher wages and a transition down the line into a senior position w/ more money).*

EmergencySwitch,I'm in a project that I'm way underqualified for and I don't know what to do [NOT Imposter syndrome],"Let me begin by saying this is **not** imposter syndrome. I know what my skill level is based on my certs and the level of projects I'd be comfortable doing. 

TL;DR: I'm assigned to a project that I'm way underqualified for and I'm not able to use my skills. How do I bring this up?

I joined a major networking company since I'm a CS major with a networking background and they felt my profile was a good fit for a network automation position.

My networking experience until that point could be equated to netadmin/sysadmin work for a small business using Unifi gear and basic off the shelf NASes. I have clearly stated my scope of work in my resume and bear in mind this is no way comparable to the work a sysadmin/netadmin does in a large enterprise.

I was assigned to a complex project with two lead architects who have more experience than my age. As much as I try to follow along during their meetings, I'm lost most of the time since these concepts are above my understanding. They are very open to me asking questions but whenever that happens, I occupy most of the meeting time instead of them getting their work done.

Since I can't contribute much to the project, I'm currently doing tasks such as documentation of workflows (which is more of a project management type role than what I signed up for).

The company is very helpful for employees to get more certs, but I feel I cannot apply my current cert knowledge to the current project I'm assigned to. My more experienced colleagues say I'm lucky to be assigned to such a nice project, and I would feel the same if I was more experienced.

I am very much open to the idea of starting lower in the totem pole as a junior netadmin or Tier 2 support.

Appropriate_Risk_899,Is my job normal or does your team actually have good morale and a positive atmosphere?,"Im on a tier2 tech support team. I've been with the company for maybe a year and a half. Started on tier1 after college and moved to tier2 as a promotion. This job has nonstop been demoralizing to me.   


Its not that my own team are rude or anything, its the nonstop chaotic projects and being behind on tickets. We have been way understaffed as well. We work from home and having to ask for help with a ticket can take a very long time. I think we are all just tired and spread thin. They hired two more to the team and that has helped, but overall it just feels like the team is tired and spread out to much on projects. Moving 100s of practices over to new software and centralizing all data type stuff. Im treated as kind of tier1 on a tier2 team in the sense that I focus on knocking out tickets and other more experienced have projects.   


Personally Im just tired. I cant focus and I dont have motivation. I actually want to move to web dev, but I dont have the skills or portfolio for that yet. Im just trying to study now and hold on for the health insurance and pay, but this job brings me no joy at all. I dont know how people do it.   


I dont know if its my company and I try a tier2 team at another place. I have fear I'd just end up in the same place or worse.   


I'm hoping by the end of the year to be able to start applying for web dev jobs, but wouldnt be surprised if the process takes me well in the next.   


Ever since I've been here I sense an overal low morale. When new people come in they seem happy and excited and the team that has been here awhile will joke about that not lasting long and they are right. Its not like they arent nice people and my boss is a decent guy, but the company feels chaotic and messy. I cant keep up with projects and changes.

I am kinda stuck and would like to hear your thoughts. So my issues are two: 

 currently I am working in NOC/incident management and I absolutely hate it  due to the stress/anxiety it is causing me. Without going too much into detail, I already suffer from anxiety/depression and the job is just making it infinitely worse due to our job  essentiall being just waiting for networks/servers/anything to break and we treat it accordingly +  tier 2 ticket handling on on-going issues and bugs.

I would like to start applying for jobs which genuinely interest me and make me happy however due to my limited experience the only thing that I know I like is working with my hands such as - repairing laptops / patching and cabling / servers / active directory . Does this mean I would want to automatically get into IT administration or systems ?

ipcisco,What happens when a network device does not find a MAC address that matches the IP address in its ARP table?,"&amp;#x200B;

The device sends out an ARP request to the destination MAC address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. This is the broadcast MAC address. All devices on the network are required to read the content of the frame. The content of the frame is a request for the MAC address of a particular device with a particular IP address.

If one of the devices reading the frame has that IP address, then it sends out an ARP reply with a destination MAC address of the device that sent the ARP request and its own MAC address as the source MAC address. The reply is received by the requesting device and the MAC address and corresponding IP are added to the device’s ARP table.

If none of the devices reading the ARP request has the particular IP address in the request, then the requesting device does not receive a reply to its request. It therefore ends up with no MAC address corresponding to that particular IP address and is unable to communicate with that device if it happens to be on the LAN.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1646209618

terrorSABBATH,Looking for some advice feeling completely out of my depth,"I work with an IT Service provider. We have clients from a one person accountant firm to company's with 600 employees. We support remotely and we have Field Engineers for callouts/installs. I'm a field engineer.

My history is that I had ZERO experience in IT before I started. I watched a few YouTube videos on how to build a PC. That was it. Anyhow, I managed to get a company to take a chance on me and 2 years later I'm still there.

But there is a but. I'm really good at grunt work, the installing of new machines, profile transfers, data, software and troubleshooting, talking to clients, being on time, well presented, my Administration is all great but the company keeps loading the high pressure jobs on me. That are WAY above my skill and knowledge. All with the usual line of ""Ah if you got any problems, just call one of the senior guys"". Oh also, when I'm not on the road with clients I'm on the helpdesk doing the BASIC support requests.

The problem is, we have a huge new client who has spent £100,000's on their entire IT infrastructure and I was sent in to be their IT guy for a week while they were opening. Their network has vlans in play, managed switches and a multitude of equipment I can't pronounce or understand. Their managers are coming to me looking for things to be done and I don't even recognize the words they are using so trying to relay these questions to the senior guys in my company is incredibly difficult.

I've got engineers from other contractors too that are looking for the ""IT guy"" as they need something and I'm completely 100% out of my depth. Again they are saying words that I don't understand.

It got so bad last week that the contractors were laughing at me and were making jokes like ""well there's no point asking the IT guy and they would all laugh. At that stage I just left the site and sat in my van for 2hrs. Feeling ashamed and embarrassed.

All of this is compounded by me going on call. It's 6am to 10pm for 7 days. I'm on call every 6 weeks.
Again, they just railroaded me into being on call. Like my boss just walked up to me on a Thursday and said, ""Your going on call on Sunday"". That was that. I told him I'm not ready but he wasn't interested. On call is everything from account unlocks to entire systems being down and your the guy to sort it. Now, Monday to Friday 8am to 5.30 the guys on the desk sort out any problems but anything not cleared before 5.30 gets passed on to the on-call guy. I'm by FAR the most inexperienced engineer they have yet there are guys who don't do On-call. They just refused. So I'm looking at the better, more experienced engineer's who technically would be better suited to being on call than me and yet they aren't on the rota. I just got dropped into it.

I'm nowhere near the level to be dealing with network outages and yet they just pile it onto me. The week before my on-call I'm stressed out just thinking of it. It genuinely affects my ability to even carry out my own work. The week on call is an absolute nightmare just waiting for the calls that may or may not come. I'm stressed off my tits really for two weeks. Its too much for me.

I guess what Im looking for is advice from people who have had similar experiences. Does any of this ever get easier? Should I approach my manager and explain what happened last week? I just don't know.

Regarding being on call, everybody hates it and there is real animosity to the guys who don't do it and I don't wanna be the guy that isn't pulling his weight.

bmurrb,How possible is it to break into IT halfway through a cert as a career change?,"I am not trolling. I had some complications with my health earlier this winter, and finally have it under control. I (24M) was working on an A+ cert before it all happened. I have worked in manufacturing for nearly my entire working life, and I have a lot of reasons to make this switch, but as of now, repetitive heavy lifting will 100% exacerbate my condition. So it is somewhat of a pressing matter, especially since said complication ended up costing me my last job. 

I am about halfway through core 1 and feel I could test for it in April, maybe even the end of this month. I am currently unemployed and getting by but I would like for life to feel somewhat normal again. So, 

If I highlight people skills, the basic computer skills and functions I did at some of these jobs, and troubleshooting abilities/maintenance, could this be enough to stand out for an interview? 

Can I mention that I have fixed different laptop components myself? Or that I am independently studying for the core exams? That I have a basic understanding of internet security? 

I feel like I have a lot of soft skills and *somewhat* relevant experience with basic data entry from work. And honestly core 1 has been pretty easy to learn so far because I have fixed several different components on my laptop. I feel like I have a pretty comprehensive understanding just from being curious about it.

I am currently enrolled in a MIS major in Southern California and I am hoping to get some insight about what to expect.

If you could respond or DM me with answers to the following questions it would really help me both with this project and really determining if it is something I want to stay with or if I should switch while it is still early.

I do need 3 responses, as well as your name, title, company that you work for and email.

 

1. What is the purpose of an MIS in general and in your specific role in your company
2.  What's your favorite part about working in this field?
3.  What do you personally like most about working with your specific organization?
4. What was your career path before this and how did you decide you wanted to pursue a career in MIS?
5. What are the day-to-day responsibilities of your role and what does your typical day look like?
6. What is the typical salary range for this type of position fresh out of college? Are there opportunities to increase your salary while working with the same company? Aside from a degree, is there anything else needed to increase the salary range?
7. Have you seen a high turnover in this field? If so, are there specific reasons why?

Mad_Eon,Is it possible to get a remote Helpdesk/IT Support specialist role without prior IT job experience?,"Just like the title says, I’m wondering if it’s possible to jump into a remote IT Helpdesk or Support Specialist role as my first role in IT? I currently work a fully remote job in the tech industry but in more of a non technical role. Mainly I onboard employees and develop documentation for trainings. 

I have the CompTIA A+ cert, Google Technical Support Cert and a JAMF 100 Cert. 

I’ve been through a few interview rounds with really great companies but it usually dies at the hiring manager or in the case of this last interview, I wasn’t picked because the candidate pool was “competitive and the person they went with had prior job experience” when prompting the recruiter for improvements I could make, I wasn’t given anything other than “You did amazing, someone just did better” not super helpful to me haha. 

Am I being unrealistic here in looking for remote work as an entry gig, or should I continue to keep my nose to the app/interview grind and continue to cert up? Any suggestions are helpful. Cheers!",ITCareerQuestions,1,1646172498

_Cabbage_Corp_,Feeling trapped. Not sure what to do or where to go.,"### TL;DR^(2): Some days the best part of my job is that the chair swivels.

---

**TL;DR: WFH revoked, being forced to work from office 5 days a week. Wife and I both work 40h/week, but live paycheck to paycheck. Can't afford to leave job. Applications are either ghosted or denied. Feeling extremely trapped.**


---

#### *Preface*

I'm trying to organize a lot of thoughts and feelings and my ADHD can makes that somewhat difficult to do. I apologize if this comes across as disorganized and bit long.

---

#### **Work background**

* I (32M) work for a bank here in the Midwest, which, as others in the industry may know, means that we are slow to adopt new policies such as WFH availability. We are not the largest bank in the region, but we are still a pretty good size with around $20bn in assets.

* 3 years ago the original bank ($OB), I was hired with underwent a merger with my current bank ($CB). I was lucky enough to keep my job and even got a promotion to the Systems team as a Systems Engineer I. While I'm technically the lowest position on my team, I have a little over 7 years experience ranging from Desktop Tech to my current role, with 3 of those on the Systems team.

* I handle the majority of tickets for my team so that the higher level engineers have more time to work on higher level items and projects. Last year alone I closed 1173 tickets for my team, while the rest of my team closed ~1200 total. This puts me at approximately 97.75% closure of my teams tickets. These figures also don't include tickets that I have to transfer because they require multiple teams after our portion of the request is completed. I've estimated the numbers, and if I include those items that would put me around 1250 tickets which is 104.17%.

* Toward the middle of last year my performance dropped and I got placed on a ""Performance Improvement Plan"", which lasted 2 months during which I had weekly meetings with my manager to check on my performance. I openly admitted fault for this and dedicated myself to working harder to improve this. I was also informed that because of this, my WFH privileges were revoked and I would have to be in the office 5 days a week.

* I have since completely turned things around and now my manager has nothing but positive things to say about my performance. But, because of that issue and how my yearly goals are weighted, my yearly review was rated as ""Needs Improvement"" and directly affected my raise this year. Raises have to be approved by my manager's manager, our CIO. Last year (2021) even though my manager put in for a small raise, the CIO granted me a *whopping* 0% raise. Because of that and the performance issue I wasn't expecting much this year, and I ended up only getting a 1% raise, which amounts to $0.25 to my hourly rate.

---

#### **Personal background**

* In 2018 my wife and I were blessed with twin girls, and even though we both work 40 hours a week, we have been living paycheck to paycheck since. We don't qualify for government or state aid programs because our combined yearly income (~$80k) is over the maximum limit for our area.

* We've done what we can to minimize our expenditures, including: shopping at Aldi for all of our food items, and only going to Wal-Mart for necessities that aren't carried at Aldi (these are the only two grocery stores in our area that have remotely reasonable prices), asking family members to watch our children whenever they can to reduce our childcare costs which usually still amounts to $120/week, mostly eliminating eating out and cooking as many meals as possible at home, totally eliminating date nights, as well as several other things.

* However, the office I report to is a 1 hour commute (40 miles, one way), which puts 400 miles a week on my car. This is putting additional strain on our finances due to increased fuel consumption and more maintenance for my car.

---

#### **Now for the relevant part of my post**

* **For reasons unknown to me, since the merger, our current CIO (part of $CB before merger) seems like he as an issue with me and has straight up called me a liar for ""playing games on my phone"" based on a candid photo from another manager.** 

 \&gt; I've seen the photo in question and it doesn't actually show me playing anything on my phone, just that I was looking at it while it was in landscape orientation.

 \&gt; However, since the other manager reported it to him as me playing games, that's what he thinks, even though I stated my case based on the ""evidence"".

* **For the last 2 1/2 months I have been WFH due to various illnesses (I caught a nasty cold, my girls caught Covid 1 week apart because it would have been too convenient for them to get it at the same time, and a very bad gout flare up for which my doctor put me on a 2 week WFH order.)**

 \&gt; During this time, not only did my performance not decrease, it stayed stable and even increased by a good margin (I have the logs to prove it, btw).

 \&gt; I believe this was due to my work/life balance greatly improving and me being happier because of it.

* **A couple weeks ago, during our 1 on 1, I requested that my manager see about me working more from home.**

 \&gt; He understood, but while he is sympathetic and has ""no issues with me working more remotely"" he still has to get it approved by his manager (CIO)

 \&gt;  Last week he informed me that the CIO denied any WFH time for me.

 \&gt;  Yesterday (Feb. 28) my WFH order ended and now I'm being forced to be back in the office 5 days a week.

* **I have been looking for other jobs for a while now, but I have either been ghosted or denied. I believe this is partly because I don't really know how to make myself look good on paper. Reasons being:**

 \&gt; I don't have a degree.

 \&gt; The only certification I have is the __AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals__.

 \&gt; My IT work history isn't very long.

 \&gt; While I have experience with several different systems, none of it is very long. The longest one is PowerShell with 7+ years. After that it would be Active Directory (On-Prem) for 4 years.

* **Some of my accomplishments:**

 \&gt; I'm an Advanced PowerShell user.

 \&gt; I took over maintaining and adding improvements to our Server provisioning module.

 \&gt; Handling all new Server requests.

 \&gt; I took over the maintenance of my team's PS module. This included organization of all functions into separate files, applying proper comments, and applying proper formatting standards to make readability and editing easier for everyone.

 \&gt; I have written modules that include several functions that leverage the APIs for our email firewall (Proofpoint) and each of our ServiceNow instances (Prod/Test/Dev).

 \&gt; Decommissioning Servers per LOB request. This includes updating our Asset Management table in ServiceNow with retirement dates and reasons.

 \&gt; Worked with our Development team to define a standard process for my team to deploy code that affects production systems like ServiceNow.

 \&gt; Worked with our Help Desk to develop several tools to help them increase their effectiveness and efficiency.

 \&gt; Worked with other IT teams to develop automation for some of their processes to increase efficiency and eliminate human errors.

 \&gt; Worked with the majority of vendors that utilized our old SFTP solution (Secure Transport) during the migration to our new solution (GoAnywhere).

 \&gt; My manager made me the primary administrator for GoAnywhere. Including, but not limited to, all Application updates, all OS updates, configuring any new vendor configurations, troubleshooting transfer issues, and tracking inactive/obsolete vendor accounts.

 \&gt; I've started working more with our certificate renewals through Entrust.

 \&gt; I handle 90% of our DHCP scope requests. Including adding new scopes, and modification of existing scopes.

* We have monthly Town Hall meetings with our C levels. At the end of these meetings there is a Q&amp;A session, and we are encouraged to submit any questions we may have prior to the meeting, but can also submit questions during the meeting.

 \&gt; To submit questions prior to the meeting we have to directly email them to HR.

 \&gt; If we submit questions during the meeting, even though other employees can't see them, the meeting's moderator will see them submitted and the name of the employee submitting them.

 \&gt; IMO, this discourages employees from submitting questions they really want the answers to, since they have no way of submitting them anonymously and therefore any question can be easily traced back to the employee.

 \&gt; Personally this makes me nervous to submit questions that I really want answers to, some of which may come across as a little... ""snarky"", for fear of any potential repercussion.

* I'm the only one on my team (6 total) that works at our secondary Operations Center. The rest of my team, manager included, works in our main Operations Center over an hour away from this one (~2 hours from where I live).

 \&gt; Don't get me wrong, I enjoy (most of) the work, and my team is great. I never feel like an outcast even though I'm remote from them. 

 \&gt; Because I'm already remote though, in my mind there wouldn't be a difference between me working at the Ops Center or WFH.

Zee_GT,I have 6 months available to choose and study for a new career. Where should I go from here?,"Hey intelligent people! Really hoping I can seek wisdom on what best to do with the time I have available. Long story short, I've been working customer service roles for the majority of my employment career. I'm 24 years old, I'm extremely dissatisfied and depressed with what I do, and I genuinely want to earn more and create a better financial life for me and my immediate family that live with me.

From a young age, I've always been considered a 'computer nerd' - I've messed around with basic programming in Pyhton, Java, but never took deep enough interest to think I should pursue it as a career. I've also messed around with routers and setup my own networks around the house from a young age. Partly because my father, before he left us, was a Network Engineer and always encouraged my curiosity with technology. My current job is a temporary contract, and it ends within 6 months. Surprisingly, even though it's a temp job, it's one of the best I've had because there are just a few calls a day to deal with. So I have ample time. Was wondering what career paths people could advise which I could obtain certificates/education within 6 months for?

I know I want to do something in IT so careers I have been exploring: Security Analyst, Data Analyst, QA Test Engineer, Cloud Engineer \[too much to learn?\], Network Engineer \[All the exams for CCNA seemed daunting\], Software Engineer, Web Analyst, Web Development, etc.

As lazy as it sounds, I want to learn skills which I will get paid more than just the average salary. It took me a while to realise that higher earning is derived from what you know over what you do. I read around that certain IT job roles are much more relaxed and easier than others, and if I'm being honest, being content matters more than the highest paying job. I'm not saying that job has to fulfil my 'passions' or what not, I have hobbies &amp; personal goals for that. But being able to hold the job for a while with contentment does matter to me. I love working from home, so if it's a job I could do remote, that would be an even bigger plus.

If anyone could offer careers to consider, courses to look at, or even share their experiences, it would genuinely mean a lot to me. I'm 24, I feel like I haven't achieved much in life, and I really don't want these next 6 months to go to waste. If people could summarise the best way to use my 6 months to get into these recommended job roles, that would also be really appreciated. I know that with the Cyber security and programming there is a very large learning curve that 6 months may not suffice for, so I've been looking at Analyst roles and QA roles a lot. Was told by a friend of mine that he managed to secure a web development job by just becoming proficient with WordPress, but not sure how interesting that sounds. Thank you so much for taking the time to read through my post. I hope you're in the best of health both physically and mentally, and wish you a great rest of your day/evening.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1646158071

My official title when I started was 'Network Administrator' but I was in charge of all things IT or electronic. On the day to day, I did helpdesk, user device management, server management, network security and operations, and pretty much anything else you can think of. I was the point of contact along with our CISO to negotiate vendor contracts and work with auditors and state/federal examiners. I presented audit and exam findings to upper management and our Board of Directors. I was brought in to most management meetings to discuss new products and services the bank was considering offering.

Worked as a 1st Line Technician for nearly 3 years and was earning peanuts. Currently working in a MSP for 8 months now with the ability to work on 1st, 2nd and 3rd Line tickets.

I'm mainly interested in the money due to personal financial goals. I currently earn £22k and this 1st Line job is going up to 25k and I'm hoping to set my salary bar higher.

The reason for my move is to be remote from home due to family member I need to look after.

It's effectively for a MSP that revolves around using Intune and other mobile deployment systems to remotely manage and configure devices for Thier clients. It's everything I want to do at my current place of employment that I cannot due to in-house experience and lack of opportunities.

My salary is 70k + 10% bonus. New role is 75k base. Old role the pay was at its cap approximately. New role starting as a base and will increase overtime as I learn and get more experienced.

Nalotaib,Switching career from IT (System Engineer) to sales,"
Hi all, 

29 years old currently 6 months in my job as a System Engineer (TCS) contracted to a government established working as an application support in the IT operation department. 

I graduated late and at first I thought I wanted to get into sales cause I saw the money there but wasn’t able due to lack of experience in selling technology. So I started doing this technical IT job as an application support. 

Now I got an offer from a start-up (growing fast not sure if it’s start-up anymore) as a sales executive for a whole region… and confused if I should make the switch.

I generally don’t like IT operation. A lot of stress and anxiety as your sole job is ensuring things are working… meaning fixing the mistakes of other people. However, over the past 6 months, I begun to digest it but not totally. The commute to work is average of 35 minutes in the morning and 45 returning home. Meaning about an hour and half each day is lost driving to and out of work. On the other hand, the sales job is a remote work where I will be required to sell solutions to restaurants and cafés to digitize their payments and inventory management system. I won’t be talking to c-level executives for these deals, which is a big concern to me since my goal is to switch to big companies such as google and apple etc.. 

There isn’t any difference between the salary. (Sales job will offer monthly commissions if I hit the target)

SuperScrim,4 Months in IT at a hospital: here's an update to how everything is going,"Hey all, back again with another update. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back in October, I landed an Entry level IT Job (Thanks to all in this sub!) 

I'm currently a field tech at a hospital, and I just wanted to give an update as to what my day to day is like. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. I've gone more in depth with most of the applications the hospital uses, and i'm able to troubleshoot most issues on my own.
2. I still do moves (literally moving PCs from one place to another) but not quite as often as I did when I first started.
3. The hospital has 4 offsite locations and I have worked at all 4 of them (one was setting up and doing asset management for credit card machines, one was for a networking issue, one was building a new PC for a physical therapy department, and the last location is directly across the street and I've been there for multiple different things)
4. My current workload is primarily fulfillments, which is just switching a user over from a desktop to a laptop. 
5. I still work off of tickets that come through ServiceNow.
6. Back in November, I was tasked with building PCs for the Neurology department, that turned in to me going extremely in depth with EEG machines, Invasive Cardiology and all of the applications that they use (I find this very interesting). I learned how to troubleshoot all of the issues with the EEG carts, configured all of the test environments of them and even learned how to troubleshoot their server issues. I made really good contacts doing this. 
7. In addition to #6, a new job opened up for a Clinical Systems Analyst for Invasive Cardiology and it's essentially what I'm doing now, and I just applied for it! (Wish me luck)
8. I've gotten better with Powershell even though my day to day doesn't require it too much.
9. The main thing I can advise is to be a sponge and soak up as much information as possible (AND TAKE GOOD NOTES). I no longer have the anxiety when presented with an issue, and my thought process has shifted to ""Why is this problem happening and what would cause it""
10. I still have so much to learn, and I am so excited to continue this journey. Thanks again to everyone in this sub for all of the support and the information that has helped me so much.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1646096493

Boring_Ad3691,"What is the point of w2 contracts? Seems like the worst of both worlds, IMO.","Can anyone explain the benefit of w2 contracts from a workers perspective?  


To me, it seems like the worst of both worlds. You don't get the flexibility and autonomy of a 1099 contractor, you still have to answer to the staffing firm. If the client side management wants you to show up to pointless meetings, change your schedule, etc, then they can go to the staffing firm and just tell them to tell you to do all that bullshit.   


But you're a w2 on the staffing firm side, so you get benefits right? I have been with 3 different staffing firms and all 3's healthcare plans high deductible plans were $400 a month. The gov market place polices were cheaper, with same deductible. Recruiters have straight up told me ""benefits are not good, and most people don't get them"". 

I know staffing firms, clients, etc are all different, and my experience is purely anecdotal, but I just don't see the sense in w2 contracts, from the perspective of the contractor/employee.   


If anyone's interested in contracts, I would recommend going 1099 route. If you do go w2, I would go for short term contracts are really emphasize you have no interest in going full time. If you express interest in going full time, they are going to take advantage of that.

HalpMeObi-WanKenobi,Where to now? Systems Administrator on to.... question mark?," Hey, y'all!

I have been in my current position for almost 3 years and feel that I have hit the cap. I’m a systems administrator making \~63k per year. I work for a “big name” quasi-government entity. I have a bachelor's degree in IT.

Right now, I do everything for my systems. I control the backend, software, servers, installations, troubleshooting of PCs that connect to my systems, vendor management, project management, funding allocations, automation, etc. 

I am tired of having to go into the office and deal with a huge amount of stress for the amount that I am being paid. Looking to go somewhere else, work remotely, and make more money.

I really enjoy using Python to automate IT-related tasks. I made a script that telnets into WAPs and returns the status of those WAPS based on telnet output. I made a script that encrypts passwords and inserts them into a SQL database. I made a script that automated a data entry task that had to be done through the GUI. I’ve made a script that crunches data from thousands of inputs and spits out the relevant statistics. Python is fun!

I’d love to get into more data analysis (is that what I’m doing? IDK). I’d like to be less stressed. I’d like to work remotely. I’d like to be paid more. I am up for changing my title/position.

Any suggestions on where to go? Any suggestions on a job title that is what I’m doing? Is it a systems administrator?

giorgioc722,"Think I made a career mistake, could use some perspective","I recently took on a help desk position that's paying 75k + OT (salary non exempt) which is nice. I come from a background of 6 years with geek squad in the field/remote.

During that time at Geek Squad I got my degree in MIS and took an IT Audit job which after two years I got pretty overwhelmed with the hours and made the rash decision to accept the help desk job since it was close to my current pay. The idea was to work my way into being a sysadmin.

The reason I think I made a mistake, is I'm doing really basic work. They use an MSP for help desk and some engineering, so my understanding is I would be a T2/T3 escalation point for issues. In reality I'm here changing printer toner, troubleshooting monitors, BSOD, etc. All basic T1 stuff for end users, Geek Squad was literally more challenging. I don't touch anything in regards to AD, servers, etc.

I made it huge point during interviews I wanted to grow outside of that. I'm not mad at them, I understand I took a help desk job.

We discussed about me wanting to be a sysadmin, but I've only been here a month so I don't expect anything. We talked about learning end point manager, but ultimately that's not up to my boss. 

The entire IT dept is me, an infrastructure eng, network eng, and the MSP. I don't really see room for growth here, the job is easy and the benefits are great, but I don't want to get stuck like I did at Geek Squad.

Am I wrong to say that script interviews are the worse kind to have in a interview? I understand this is a personal opinion but universally I find it to be extremely lazy and unprofessional.

Had a interview 20 minutes ago and it was primarily off a script which he even said and to me it feels out of place and puts me off. Added bonus there was another colleague in the interview who rarely said much.

My previous interview which got me this job (MSP) was the best interview ever. Laid back and the manager was walking around in his socks. Now that tells you something and there was a balance of technical questions, customer questions and chit-chat about life.

In my opinion I feel like you can get the smartest person but who is to say they are social acceptable in your team? How do you know they fit if you dont express yourself or describe how the team operates and work together? Btw this is going from MSP environment to internal with one company.

The learning curve has been steep but I am definitely better placed for it. I eventually want to work in infrastructure mainly around IaaS and hopefully move into DevOps at a later date.

I am working with an MSP at the moment, that is fairly new but expanding quickly. They are a nationwide organisation that wants to promote from within.

And as they are a new company, I am not sure about the legitimacy of their claims for promoting within.

Rubicon2020,Would like some input on jobs in IT in Network and System Admin work,"I’m currently a sr desktop support tech, but also do admin work such as budget, purchasing, dealing with vendors such as Dell, Fortinet, SHI, etc. and also I am in charge of our Office365 rollout, plus 2 additional phone systems in 2 new locations, and also point on training the lower tech. This team is me, one tech, and a contractor. Everything I’m in charge of project wise I’ve learned as I went huge in trial and error. 

My issue is I love my job, I love the admin work, I absolutely hate end user help. I’m tier 2-3 and tier 1 when my tech can’t figure it out. I’m just so sick of people. Maybe it’s just the people I work with. They are wonderful people, great people to be around but they seriously need to take intro to internet and office suite classes. I’m so tired of the full blown ticket listed as emergency, when it’s simply showing them how to use the bookmark bar…again. Or adding a shortcut to sites most used on the desktop. Or my favorite “it doesn’t work!” Ok what doesn’t work? “All of it.” Like the fucker is on so it works what’s the problem. And the steps of babying these people to get out what they need just drives me ape shit. 

Obviously, I’m not a very good people person. I’m never rude to anyone even when I’m showing my tech the millionth time how to do something and he still doesn’t seem to take notes. I just absorb the anger and release it later. But it’s like this every damn day. My husband thinks I’m an idiot for wanting to change my career to medical assistant as that’s an even more customer service field. 

If I get a job in a NOC or as Network/System Admin would I deal more with HW/SW? 

I’m thinking if I just change employers it would help. I love the medical field was originally going into it, but injured myself and I couldn’t stand or walk due to severe lower back pain where I needed a walker damn near wheelchair for a good 3 years before I cut all pain meds, muscle relaxers but 1, and began a physical therapy I created myself and after 2 years lost 80lbs and can walk a hell of a lot better. It ain’t perfect but it’s much better. So I went into IT cuz my doc really thought I was going to be paralyzed and wheelchair bound. But I do love IT. It’s a lot of fun, it’s just the people are oh my god! so fucking stupid. And they’ve done this job for 5-10 some 17-25 years and yet the basics is not there. And they refuse to learn how to do it. As I’ve shown them how so many times. 

I’m not sure if it’s just this job environment or if it’s like that everywhere?",ITCareerQuestions,1,1646053317

aryaazar78,I am a Helpdesk technician and don't know what to do next.,"Hello. I have my A+ certificate, a helpdesk technician job at a small company for 2 years, and a computer networking degree with emphasis on cisco. I learned everything for a network + degree, but Covid happened, closing all the testing centers, and now I forgot it all. I also feel I did not learn Cisco very well and also forgot it all by now. My job is mostly just office 365, setting up computers for new hires, troubleshooting of office and computers using my knowledge or Google, and a lot of easy tasks like shipping computers or just turning on a computer, connecting to Bluetooth microphone, and clicking zoom link for the VP. I also manage the VOIP phones with RingCentral and just help people in general in computer related things. I make $21 USD an hour, which is below a living wage where I am as it is an expensive area. It is a good job in that my boss likes me and gave me 10% raise first year, then 5% next claiming HR capped it, but he also works remote since start of the pandemic, and I am mostly to myself not really learning much from him like he originally (pre-pandemic) promised to show the more advanced IT things to me. I felt a bit stagnant as this company has nowhere else to go with the entre IT department being my boss and me. I feel like I have learned as much as I can. He also said he will give me a promotion and give me tier 2 title with a raise, though has not told me the amount yet. I asked for more responsibilities, but he said there is nothing more to do.

However, I also have been applying and it seems I got a job offer at another small, but not as small company that is a manufacturer for $25.15. I really doubt whatever my current boss offers will match that. They seemed nice and promised I can shadow the network engineer or the system admin too. While I do like my current company, I think leaving to it would provide a good opportunity to learn more as it seems they use more advanced programs like active directory and less cloud things. I have the weekend to think on the job offer.

However, I do want to not be in a low wage forever, but there are so many paths I feel overwhelmed. I do not know what I like more. I had trouble with depression in school and failing at computer science, but my parents are pressuring me to get any degree. I was originally going for computer science but dropped out, then went back later to get the computer networking degree. I have the certificate to transfer and every GE done from my community college that I could use for a CIS or IT degree, but I failed epically with coding and also calculus classes and am terrified of taking again since I'd likely have to retake lower classes too. I have ADHD that my parents stopped me from being able to take meds for, and have been depressed. Plus, there is the downside of some not being online, and taking time away from getting certificates, and maybe not able to work at same time. Certificates are not as much doing classes for things I will never use, but it is likely not as good looking as a bachelor's degree. I feel lost as there are so many different ways, but I do not know what to do. Should I get a degree, try to learn more skills or certs? How do I find out which path is good without much exposure to it? What skills should I learn to get a higher wage IT job?
All I know is that I have always liked computers. I liked finding out problems, doing things like virtual machines. I made a bunch of different servers on my raspberry pi like a VPN, file server, web server, and pihole just for fun. I built my PC for gaming and have always liked technology. I tried out a bunch of linux distros in a virtual machine to try it out. I like different operating systems. Is there any job that could match doing these stuff? Maybe system admin? What projects can I make to gain skills? Any advice would be appreciated.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1646053051
TonyPonder,Where to next? Struggling with losing technical skills in a non-technical role,"I've been in the IT industry with around 20 years and navigated my way through technical roles into team lead positions and from there onto management roles. I have always worked hard and have always received great feedback from colleagues/management etc. That meant I graduated to a certain level of pay that I feel I once deserved but don't feel it's deserved any longer, or rather I would rather focus my time and energy elsewhere.

The last few years I've moved away from the technical side of things and I don't feel I am providing value to the company. The work I'm doing feels mundane and any passion I do show is fabricated and that is tiring in itself.

Has anyone gone through similar? How do you tackle periods like this? I am looking to upskill at the moment but I feel like I am out of the technical details with a few years and think it would be difficult to get back in.

My current company is offering 5k retention bonus and a position move to a more technical position (network engineer) for 75k base starting may 1st. They are also offering to pay for training and certifications (CCNA). They also offer unlimited PTO. Cons to this company is that it’s in an industry I’m not passionate about (hotel/hospitality). 

New company is FAANG offering 70k base and 13k sign on bonus year 1, 11k sign on bonus year 2 and 9 RSU vested over 4 years. I would be limited to a total of 11 PTO days. The position would be support engineer for their warehouse (you can probably guess the company based off that alone).

While I got this momentum rolling with passing CySA+, should I possibly look into starting my journey to obtain CISSP? Another option is to hold off on CISSP and put all these free courses of Splunk to use and grab the User/Power User certs? The training is free through my job and Splunk seems to be on every cybersecurity analyst job posting out there (CISSP as well). The thought process with CISSP is that CySA+ just brushed over some security topics so could be some slight overlap in the material, although CISSP isn't a very technical cert.

From program associate to associate engineer with decent raises, ect, but not quite software engineer title yet.

I don’t mind the job but overtime the flaws of the team and company have begun to really weigh on me. I think I have probably pushed it to the side for too long bc of anxiety.
Part of it was on me, I feel like I could have done more and gotten more out of my experience and then left earlier. 
But regardless the environment and team is unorganized. My manager rarely makes effort to meet for 1 on 1s. My mentor moved to another team, and some other senior developers moved to another team or left the company. Recently 2 more team members are leaving. Our only UI developer on the team. And another regular developer. And then one new person has joined. The team is also not very social and doesn’t communicate well but they are trying to work on it at least. 

I feel like its not an ideal environment for me to grow in as a new developer.

Making sure patch ports were labeled correctly. At this company, everything is done by the book so those things are followed by guidelines from the beginning of the site being pre built to post production.

My manager expects me to come up with projects from thin air and I can also state that my mentor is also clueless as to what projects could be created. They said to me. ""I mean, If it's not broke don't fix it, right?""

For the past 3-4 months I have been slowly breaking into the realm of cybersecurity, studying for my CompTIA A+, and subsequently my security+, and CCNA.

I come from a background of taking CS I &amp; II in middle school, but coming from a very blue collar family, put my passion for computers to the side to go to work. I worked in the kitchen for a while, and then found myself in the automotive industry at Audi as a mechanic. 

I then realized I want to be able to hike with my kids when I’m 45, quit Audi, and got a job at T-Mobile as a “tech expert” troubleshooting phones and other devices that T-Mobile offers (home internet, IOT devices, etc..), this seems pretty decent for now, providing me with a great opportunity to restart my education. I fucked off in high school, never trying because I could always float by, dropped out and got my diploma at a completion program, blah blah blah. 

My plan is to take advantage of my local community college’s cyber security program, get a 4.0, and subsequently climb the next rung, hopefully with a scholarship in my pocket. I live in the PNW, so I have access to hundreds of stellar cybersecurity programs( or so I am lead to believe). 

My question I guess, I stumble while not having a live, in person, mentor at times, and I struggle developing my own curriculum. 80% of the time I have no trouble teaching myself “x” material, but 20% of the time, I will hit some wall and I’ll need someone with more experience than I to help overcome it. Usually they are pretty stupid walls. Yesterday I was in the first stages of creating a password generator/encryption machine/manager, and it stopped taking my users inputs, like somehow the string “add” != “add” and I just said fuck it and went and took a nap. 

Is this a normal thing? I have pretty damn bad ADHD, I’ve always thought the easiest way to overcome that situation is a structured environment like school. Consequently I’m an overachiever to the fullest degree, I love to prove things to myself. So I’d like to set the goal of a doctorate. 

Is this healthy? Does anyone see any red flags here? I would love to hear input from those of you that have been doing this a long time.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645987252
kronckers,Am I being ripped off? Level 4 apprenticeship - Minimum Apprentice wage,"I am an 18 year old IT Technician in the UK. Currently completing a level 4 apprenticeship after finishing a level 3. I am on minimum apprentice wage (£9k~yearly), and have been since I've started. I've been with this company over a year, and asked for a pay rise as I am technically qualified under Level 3 IT Technician. 

I was given a new hourly salary of £4.81, rather than £4.30. This is going to be the new minimum wage for apprentices in the UK from April, so technically just minimum wage 2 months early. 

My job role is extremely varied, but goes from basic password resets to firewall configuration, server configuration and maintenance (things like Ubuntu Owncloud, VyOS, and WDS), with a lot of local VM configuration and migration as the bread and butter. 

I hear lots of stories of apprentices, less so or equally qualified as I am on significantly higher wages. Including starter GCSE failing plumper apprentices on £16k, and starting level 3 IT apprentices on £15k. 

My question is, am I being entirely taken advantage of here? A lot of the staff treat me like their own minion, I often find myself doing tech support out of hours with no overtime benefits, due to users in different time zones. I have colleagues who treat me as their own person minion. I'm not sure if I'm being repaid fairly...

NoobAck,"Having trouble finding good work even with a pretty decent resume with some experience? I was, too.","So, an experience I had recently.

I was in a large metro area that I was struggling for years to find good work in IT. The market was saturated and finding people with massive experience was not hard at all. I was looking for a basic desktop tech position. Nothing fancy 40k-50k

I moved to a city with much less population for an unrelated reason and I was barely looking for work and I got picked up for a major project with good pay. A project I'm uniquely qualified for and will push me into higher levels quite quickly. I already pushed myself into a new role without doing anything differently than I should or already know which is much higher level.

I can't really go into details about it or my situation.

For reference, my experience is mostly desktop hardware with a few years of intense training in corporate service desk, mostly due to personal drive.

My certs/qualifications are they're A+, project+, 4 year in unrelated field, 8+ years of unrelated experience, 5 years of basic hardware and software support total. Service desk is basically the entry level to IT jobs so if you don't have a few years of that you'll need a niche cert or degree to move past it. 

But I never really broke into the higher end of IT until I moved and had much less competition. Now, my target is 100k-120k within the next year and I'm already negotiating for this new position around that sweet spot of 80-90k.

Sure, the new area is more expensive to live in but before I was making low income and being boxed out of even basic desktop support roles that paid 25+ an hour most of the time.

I have to tend to them because there's really nothing saying otherwise. So I tend to them. Now I'm behind on my actual thing. Then I finish the thing and get back to my desk and there's 10 tickets. I'm tending to those tickets... then someone calls me. I answer the phone and of course it's something VERY IMPORTANT! ""My monitor just stopped working!!"" they say. I ask ""Is it plugged in?"".

FineAcanthocephala64,2nd interview suggestions (technical) - interview guide has me worried,"First time poster and I appreciate all feedback.

I've progressed to a second interview (technical) with  a company that works with only ""modern"" tech. The tech is all run on AWS and everything is done using terraform and there also looks to be a lot of kubterbetes stuff as well. I'm super excited as this is the tech I want to work with and become comfortable with as this is where a lot of opportunities look to be, but I don't have too much experience with this stuff yet because I've simply not needed to work with it. I also really want to get this job as the product is something I'm super passionate about.

For context, my background includes network/ security engineering and currently infrastructure engineering (linux) working with both on prem and basic cloud stuff and a fair amount of network and security related stuff as well. I have experience managing infrastructure through code using puppet, ansible and using gitlab pipelines for app config management.

I don't have experience managing AWS workloads at scale but I understand a lot of the concepts. I also don't have experience with terraform although I had a quick play and provisioned some stuff in an aws lab fairly easily and this looks very simular to puppet which should make for an easier learning curve (both use declarative code). My AWS experience is limited to ec2, route53 and vpc related services unfortunately as I've worked in fairly static environments for AWS until now.

I only have basic container experience through local docker and gitlab docker stuff but again understand the concepts of kubernetes but have never stood up a cluster to have a play to understand things. 

I don't have time to lab stuff up before this interview.

I was sent a pre interview guide and this states a lot of the technical questions are going to be a deep dive into my aws knowledge...  Which has me worried as I really want the role and know I'm a quick learner and do take the time to lab stuff at home to better my knowledge if it's required for work.

Any suggestions for prep and how to approach the interview? Thanks in advance!",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645943477

moderatenerd,How are the differences government VS corporate jobs for you?,"After spending 10 years working in corporate America, I finally landed an IT position working as a contractor at a government facility. 

I've done everything from dishwashing, retail, call center to general IT help to various small businesses. But this government job is by far the easiest job I've ever had!! I do maybe 2 hours of actual work on what I've been calling my 'busy' days. The rest of the time I'm babysitting the systems to clear errors and make sure nothing breaks. 

The good thing is due to the red tape I'm not actually allowed to touch most of the systems except the ones that are specifically written in my contract. I'm only responsible for either very basic hardware issues or their clearing errors in their EMR system. 

This is far different from corporate where in my experience you need to always look like you are busy and if you are not you better ask for stuff to do or help out where you can. Even if that means licking envelopes or taking out the garbage.

Positive_Shock_2811,"Feeling defeated, And not sure what to do. Could really use some constructive feedback.","I have been looking to gain experience in the information technology field for quite a few months; I have obtained a ""CCNA 200-301"" certification last September (2021). I have also started taking classes at a local community college this semester. Being able to pass a Background-Check plus a Drug-Test in addition to holding a Networking-Certification as well as attending college, And not to forget a ""G.E.D"" I have been struggling mentally with not being able to get a job in the information technology field. 

I decided after not going to college straight out of High-School that I was tired of working Dead-End jobs, And that I need to find a career. At this point I am not sure what compelled me to get a ""CCNA 200-301"", But after about 7 months of preparing in addition to taking the test twice since I was 100 points short of passing the first time. I eventually ended up becoming Cisco certified which at the time I thought was great since I knew I wanted to do networking. I figured that the ""CCNA 200-301"" would be a good choice to help me become more qualified to work in a networking position.

While searching for work over the 5 months; I have also started taking classes at my local community college to work towards an Associates-Degree at the Bare-Minimum this Spring semester. At first I began looking for jobs as a ""Network-Engineer"" since I felt like that made sense since my Cisco certification specialization is in networking, And I also want to do networking as a career. After applying for a few weeks it become fairly obvious that getting a position as a Network-Engineer with no experience may be a bit of a stretch. I have heard a lot of suggestions that I should look for positions in ""Help-Desk"" which I have been doing; I have had a few requests for interviews as well as actually participating in interviews that employers conducted who were interested in potentially hiring me for Help-Desk style positions. 

Based on my experience to me at least it seems like a lot of people are interested in my CCNA-200-301 certification, And it appears to me it has helped me get quite a few requests for interviews. I tend to get asked about it quite frequently when I interview with potential employers. It seems as though In addition to being interested in my certification that a good amount of people are impressed by it but also confused as to how I have obtained it or Why I got it considering I have no experience as from what I can deduce is a bit unusual which I didn't realize at the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude; I obtained my CCNA-200-301 certification as well as starting classes at my local Community-College. I also have no problem passing a Background check or a Drug-Test in addition to holding a G.E.D; My question is that after almost 6 months of job searching some of the time I have chalked up to bad timing such as starting to look for employment during the last month or two of the previous year as well as the current environment surrounding the ""Corona-Virus"" despite most places being completely back to normal my state has been one of the most strict which I think has potentially also stifled hiring. Anyway, My question is what am I doing wrong? I feel as though I almost get passed over for Help-Desk positions as I don't possess the typical Comptia or Microsoft ""Support"" certs despite having no experience almost equally being over looked perhaps due to coming off as over qualified which is hard to comprehend since I am far from being capable of going after more advanced positions like Network-Engineer due to lack of experience, Maybe schooling as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I almost regret not doing a Comptia certification like the A+ or one of the Microsoft certification like the MSCA (If I am not mistaken), I feel like I pretty much played myself by trying to challenge myself as well as pushing myself for a seemingly more difficult certification when I could have probably acquired a different type of certification, Maybe one that would have done a better job helping me gain the experience I desperately need so that I can eventually work towards being a Network-Engineer or something. I am really loosing hope at this point I want to believe I will eventually get a job, And I have faith I will but I just can't believe its been almost 6 months with no offer in sight. I read about people who seemingly have no certifications or experience getting pretty decent offers it is hard to not feel like a failure even if I am doing my best not to compare myself to others. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL : DR 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Regret getting a CCNA 200-301 opposed to a Comptia or Microsoft certification. 

\- Been looking for employment for close to 6 months, And Feel defeated especially when I read about other people who are seemingly less qualified then me getting offers that are pretty good in my opinion.  

\- I just don't know what to do at this point; Getting more certifications seems pointless considering the one that I already have isn't really helping. I am already going to college, And I tried getting certified so I wouldn't have this much trouble getting employment in the first place.

I plan on doing this daily (time tbd), and I will be adding whatever I pick up along the way of my studies. I will be focusing on Cybersecurity, so I will be making another, corresponding set of these cards with a baseline understanding of what I learn along the way too regarding that as well.

I've read computer science textbooks over the years, and put them into practice.  Big O, testing, best practices, etc.  I'm a bit obsessing with balancing ""properly"" and ""quickly.""

In order, I've studied Basic, Assembly, C, C++, Java, Javascript, and Swift pretty thoroughly.  I have made some pretty decent iOS apps from scratch.  I also fiddled with Haskell and some other stuff for fun.  It makes sense to me and I don't struggle much with new concepts.

Life didn't go as planned.  I wound up in another field, which has been good.  I have three unrelated degrees including a Master's.  No significant math, unfortunately.

I've heard that age discrimination is a major problem.  Apparently, if you're over 30, you know nothing and you're not desirable.  What's your take?

I would rather not do another degree because I've figured out they're not magical and I don't have unlimited time.  (Nobody does, but it might seem that way when you're under 30.)  What would people take most seriously to get into some kind of programming?

endoftimeokay,"Blurred lines of PM responsibilities, time commitment, and coverage","Hi! I recently transitioned in my large company from sales to PM. I have previous experience working at a project coordinator at a smaller organization. I have been in the role for 3 months, and I just coming to realize how much my manager and others on the team are taking advantage of me.

I hop on calls with them to discuss project plans and timelines , but instead of delegation, they expect me to do their work and almost have me functioning as an executive assistant/business analyst. I have stated my boundaries about what my role actually is, but no one is hearing me out. I also took this role with the knowledge that my salary was reflected for a 40 hour work week, but now my team is asking me to be on call 24x7, ""just in case"" I am needed without a pay increase. I spoke to my manager and he has gone back and forth on my hours, which makes its hard to enjoy weekends or even logging off for the day. This is an entry level position.

This past week, our change manager had let me know he would be out of office in a couple weeks. I thanked him for the notice and wished him well on vacation. He then proceeded to tell me that I would be covering for him, approving/denying software and hardware changes that would impact the entire digital ecosystem. I was stunned since I have no technical background and am staunchly unqualified to do his role. I know I am intelligent, but I am inexperienced and incapable of doing his job successfully.

I wanted to see if anyone has experienced anything similar (blurred lines in your role) and what advice you may have. I enjoy working at my company, but don't think I can take much more added curveballs to my plate.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645907311

uhhhnewGuy,Trying to get back into IT. Worked at MSP as IT specialist about 5 months ago then jumped into IT recruiting.,"Just as the title says, simply put, I am trying to get back into IT. 

Little background story.. I was working as an IT specialist for a MSP from 2020-2021. I ended up having to leave the company due to some personal reasons/issues going on in my life. 

I took a bit of a break to settle everything down then went back into the job market. I wanted to try something new and landed on recruiting (I’ve had previous sales roles before my IT role). 2 months in… turned out I absolutely hate cold calling and being in a sales-like role. Talking to all these IT candidates made me really miss my IT job. If none of that personal stuff happened, I know I’d still be working at the MSP and not have jumped into a new role.

I just put in my two weeks yesterday, because I am trying to study for the SEC+ cert (I do have an A+ certification already). Going in person to a class and two weeks would’ve been right before the start of the class. My manager told me they “don’t really do the 2 weeks thing”… understandable as it is mostly commission based and I don’t know what I would’ve been doing for those two weeks.

Now I got about two weeks to study on my own then go into class the following week. I am not too pressed on money, as I have good amount saved up and still living at home with very supportive parents. 

I was wondering if anyone could give me some insight on, my situation as a whole and some roles that you think I could qualify for with a year of experience, A+ and if I was to obtain the SEC+.

I still think I’d have to start at some helpdesk type role to build up experience. Maybe I’m wrong? I know there’s so many routes to take in IT and just wanted some possible ideas. Thank you all in advance!",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645897123

BlitzedITGuy,Unsure about getting a masters degree and whether a bachelors is enough?,"I have a bachelor degree in IT management and have worked as a network engineer for about 5 years now. My speciality is in Cisco and Meraki networks, routing and switching, consulting, and working on the CCNP currently. 

At the moment I am not working due to health complications from Covid and have been focusing on healing for a little over a year now. Soon I am looking to get back into the workforce. However I have been contemplating getting a masters also in IT management as well to expand my business knowledge. I am not sure if it is worth it in the long run, or even short term. 

My thought process goes like this. The technical aspects I can learn on my own. A huge part of the tech industry is the technical knowledge skillset but also, for me, I find that having a strong understanding of business is crucial to being successful in consulting and the business side of the technology sector. 

Of the many jobs I look up I really do not see many positions that require or recommend a master degree, but more so a bachelor degree with X experience and Y certifications. 

From others in the industry, have you found acquiring a master degree has helped you further your career, obtain better employment opportunities? 

Granted mine is focused more so on the business side of IT, but I just am curious if going forward getting a masters is worth it? 

From those with experience in the field, do you find that having a bachelor degree with certifications and experience to be sufficient or would a masters boost my opportunities.

anoncloudtech,I think I've been lowballed; what Types of Jobs Should I be Applying for? (Cloud Support/Database),"Backstory: So over the summer I got an internship with a FAANG Company in Datacenter Ops, and after completing it got an offer for around 55k with a sign on bonus. The problem was that they said I'd have to move to DC, and when I asked about relocation assistance they said ""no"" since I'm not corporate. When I asked if I could negotiate my rate they said ""no, this is the final offer."" The COL in DC is insane, and my family expressed I'd be okay to stay with them and work locally/remotely.

I'm in my last semester as a senior in Information Technology getting my BA. I was speaking to another student, and she had no prior experience (she'd worked HR before) and was offered 80k at another company in Cybersecurity locally, and this isn't the first time I've been told something similar. I live near NYC and can take the bus there, for context. I think I might have been lowballed here. My passion is in Infrastructure Technologies, so anything cloud based or database based, so if anything I'd not like to do Datacenter Ops for a year or two before requesting an internal role transfer that may never come.

I'm doing an Independent Study on RDBMS/NoSQL Technologies under the director of my program right now and I'd like to start working there, but don't know what roles I should be looking for. I've applied for 50 jobs directly/through indeed and have gotten 2 interviews sofar, but I feel I may be applying for the wrong job names/searching for the wrong ones.

_smartdummy_,IT engineering student with imposter syndrome needs advice,"TLDR; Not sure of my choice to study IT since most people around me is ahead. Want to find my passion in tech. Questions for you at the end.

So last year I started a five year program that will give me a masters in IT. I have never coded before but I chose this program because I feel like it’s a very “future friendly” education and it’s very exciting how the work will probably always evolve. Also because it’s broad as hell in the sense that almost all industries have work regarding IT, not just the tech industry. I also feel like I have good problem solving skills which is good to have as an engineer.

However I’m starting to feel more and more discouraged. Most of the people around me in class live to code and have been doing it since they were like 14… Even though I have passed my classes so far I feel behind and like I’m not learning enough. I also haven’t found that burning passion for coding although it’s pretty exciting to learn something totally new. I just feel like maybe I’m kidding myself and that I’m out of place… I think one of the main problem is that I’m not sure of what my goal is. I haven’t found what I think is fun in tech and what I would like to work with when I’m done. But I’m sure there is something out there for me so I would love to hear from some of you.

So my main questions for you is;

1. Is it stupid to study to be an IT engineer when I don’t spend my free time coding or reading up about the latest tech? I think my goal is to work with tech in an industry that isn’t primarily about tech. Like maybe healthcare, sports, music, fashion etc… Anyone out there that works in a situation like that and can give thoughts?
2. How diverse are the jobs for an IT engineer? Is it pretty much the same but in different formats?
3. What can I do to spark more interest for coding. The code we do in school is obviously very good for theory but is boring me out of my mind. I read somewhere that the best way to learn code is to have a project with a goal. Any tips on beginner projects?

Any advice on this matter is deeply appreciated and please ask question if you want to! Sorry for lengthy post..",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645871997

Happiest-Puppy,MS Modern Desktop Administrator Associate to compliment A Plus?,"(title doe snot allow a +)

I am having some trouble finding an entry level job with just A+.  In my region, ""entry level"" seems to be, 2-5 years help desk , and/or years of active directory.  All interviews didn't pan out.  I still might be on a short list for two, because they are well over a week late letting me know.   In one interview, I was given technical question.  Despite the years of him giving the same question, I was the \*only\* one (he says) that got the answer right (and I got all three parts of it right).  But, a single certification and good technical knowledge is nothing compared to the ""entry level"" requirement of a half decade of work history.

I just got A+ a little bit ago.  And I just started studying on Network+ and even Google IT Support Professional certificate simultaneously (most of it is just A+ overlap).  The same interviewer said it would look good if I had a MS cert.  So that got me looking at MS certs.  Its seems that the  **Microsoft 365 Certified: Modern Desktop Administrator Associate**  best aligns with with most of the entry level jobs available for me.  Its gets into Win10 deployments, administration, cloud, 365, and even some hybrid active directory.  Its gets far deeper than A+ into am office environment using Windows.

woahmyd00d,Resources for learning Windows Server and Active Directory Basics,"I recently got offered a job at a middle school. From the listing, it appeared that I would be reporting to some other person on-site as my job was split between teaching robotics/programming and giving tech support.

This seemed fine to me, as I have an A+ cert and have been doing freelance IT services in my small town for a couple of years, and I'd worked on printers, network troubleshooting, software help, the works. However in the interview I was told I would be the only on-site tech for most of the time.

I'm pretty comfortable with LAN troubleshooting but for Windows Server/Active Directory I know little to nothing. This could be problematic as if there are problems related to AD(looking at you, networked printers), I won't know how to spot them.

I don't think the issues involved in the job will be too complicated, I know the person who previously held the job, and they didn't have any certs, just knew a bit about computers(yes, they left on good terms).

So, this leads to my question. I am looking for recommendations for materials to self-learn Windows Server/Active Directory. Paid/free is fine, but lab-based(ex COMPTIA) is a big plus.

I have never coded before but I chose this program because I feel like it’s a very “future friendly” education and it’s very exciting how the work will probably always evolve. Also because it’s broad as hell in the sense that almost all industries have work regarding IT, not just the tech industry. I also feel like I have good problem solving skills which is good to have as a software engineer.

However I’m starting to feel more and more discouraged. Most of the people around me in class live to code and have been doing it since they were like 14… Even though I have passed my classes so far I feel behind and like I’m not learning enough. I also haven’t found that burning passion for coding although it’s pretty exciting to learn something totally new. I just feel like maybe I’m kidding myself and that I’m out of place… I think one of the main problem is that I’m not sure of what my goal is. I haven’t found what I think is fun in tech and what I would like to work with when I’m done. But I’m sure there is something out there for me so I would love to hear from some of you.

So my main questions for you is;

1. Is it stupid to study to be a software engineer when I don’t spend my free time coding or reading up about the latest tech? I think my goal is to work with tech in an industry that isn’t primarily about tech. Like maybe healthcare, sports, music, fashion etc… Anyone out there that works in a situation like that and can give thoughts?
2. How diverse are the jobs as a software engineer? Is it pretty much the same but in different formats?
3. What can I do to spark more interest for coding. The code we do in school is obviously very good for theory but is boring me out of my mind. I read somewhere that the best way to learn code is to have a project with a goal. Any tips on beginner projects?

Any advice on this matter is deeply appreciated and please ask question if you want to! Sorry for lengthy post…",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645843038

Recruiter then also shares with me they do all of their applicant tracking via Excel. For a global firm. What?! Red flag.

MagicWeeb,Need help applying to a help desk position after being rejected repeatedly.,"Want to ask for some help with getting a help desk job since I've gotten a few interviews but no offers. First off, I want to give a bit of my background. 

I have a bachelor degree in cyber security, and took computer operation classes(hardware, software, networking) in highschool. During my university experience,  I've been exposed to using Wireshark, spunk, azure, Linux, and various security concepts. I also have programming experience in C++, Python, and html. 

For work experience, I've worked in retail, customer support and as a stagehand. Communication, documentation, problem solving and customer resolution are some skills that I've picked up. 

Now as to why I'm applying for a help desk position when I have a degree in cyber security, I need money to help pay for the Sec+/CCNA certification, and need experience to put on my resume. My main job goal is to get a security analyst position, but that's a bit later on. I'm putting this here because it's a common question I got when I asked for advice before. 

The issues I run into is that I don't get many interviews, and when I do it's a 1099 contract. So far I've gotten no offers, even with low offers (14$ an hour.) Admittedly I've been looking at remote jobs since I live in an rural area and commute could be an hour long with about the same pay. 

I've already adjusted my resume to be ATS friendly, added buzzwords, and added the skills listed in a job posting (ones I have). 

So basically,
1. What makes a better resume? More buzzwords? Lengthy explanation of skill-set
2. What are interviewer's looking for in an interview, I mostly just answer their question and gave explanation about experience I've had with software or certain concepts. 
3. Are 1099 contracts the norm, with regular set schedules? From what I've read it's mainly an illegal way of getting an employee to pay company taxes, which can be reported to the IRS (depending on circumstance).",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645835191

Inevitable_Ad_8193,Starting internship after a big break in the IT world. Please let me know your advice.,"Background:
First time posting here but been a reader for a while.
I live in the US now but I’m from a different country. While living abroad, after a couple call centers as CSR I managed to land a role as part of Access Management Team for a MSP that had GE(General Electric) as their main campaign.
Pretty much lots of AD groups and users, Exchange 2010, ARP, iDM, and all the lingo that I can’t remember much no more. This was about 8 years ago….

Currently:
After becoming an American citizen I decided to go back to school. Did GED in less than a week, and went for a Network and sys admin associates at my local college (Texas).
Im half way thru it now and I managed to land a 20ish/week paid internship (after being referred by my CCNA professor) as I guess Helpdesk/solo type of guy at a small mom and pops company. My internship mentor  is in a diff city and pretty much have access to Meraki (Desktop Central), AD, and all the jazz that helpdesk gotta do.

I guess everything has happened really fast for me and I’m still trying to see where I’m at.
I should be going for my CCNA this summer, feel very confident about it. I was told by my internship mentor to try to get the windows server admin fundamentals very, which honestly as far as I can tell seems pretty easy.
My plan is to finish the degree and since idk how long the internship is(wasn’t told) just stay there until I feel confortable enough to apply for sys admin roles.

I accepted an offer for Desktop support which is 2 hours away for \~5k more, it's supporting a massively well known networking company full time permanent with benefits but hired by contractor who's hired by a WITCH company who got the contract from the OG company.

&amp;#x200B;

Then later I got an offer for Help Desk, which would involve going out to remote sites for potentially multiple weeks (most likely less than one week) in company provided vehicle. It's kinda local, like 30-40 minute commute through rural area.  \~5k less yearly salary, 6 month contract, not guaranteed full time hours, and no benefits.

I think 2 hours is a big commute, but it offers benefits and my teeth are REALLLY messed up and I haven't ever had benefits since I was a kid in school still lol so this is a big thing.

nanjero,Where do i go from level 1 tech support after 3 years I feel like I have stagnated in my career.,"I have been working for a small MSP company (6 people) for 3 years as a level 1 tech support. 

The workload has been ok there has been busy days and quiet days so it is not like i hate the job.

I have learned a lot in those 3 years as I got in the job straight out of university (computer science course).

But because the way the company works is that everyone is a jack of all trades in that everyone is trained to do all sorts of jobs instead of being specialised or assigned for specific tasks,

I feel that I have stagnated in my career. I am still learning new things from time to time. But a majority of the time the jobs we get are the same level 1 type jobs we have done many times and doesnt really contribute to improving our career or our own knowledge.

I have started looking for things to do outside of work such as getting certifications. But I am not really sure what career path I really want to commit to. 

I am interested in networking but I dont really know what careers it entails. I also did a bit of programming in university but havent done any programing since i started this job or outside of work so i think I have wasted that knowledge.

I guess another negative aspect of the small company is that we try our best to implement solutions to industry standard but a lot of the small or medium size companie we deal with usually do not want to spend any extra money unless absolutely necessary so some of our implemented systems are setup in the most minimal way possible and not up to industry standard.

ITjoeschmo,[Anecdote] MSP interview with CEO/founder gave me red flags,"So, I went on the job hunt December-January after nearly 2 years break from work and this was one of the interviews I had. I just wanted to share because why not.    
    
My experience is basically \~2 years help desk, 2 years senior desktop support w/ higher level stuff throughout (e.g. maintaining vmware environment, root cause analysis of issues in environment, lots of automation using PowerShell, project work, collaborating on other IT team projects to help them leverage PowerShell, etc).  

I applied to a plethora of jobs -- I was out of the field for nearly 2 years but needed a job relatively soon and I really wanted something fully remote, so I was applying to roles that are less attractive than what I would usually go for. I applied to a lot of ""help desk tier 2"" MSP roles (you know, the ones that are nearly sys admin jobs but you still do support and have the help desk title). I know MSPs in general have a bad reputation, but I also know they aren't all bad.    
    
Anyways, I join the interview with the CEO of the MSP. Everything goes great at first --  we shared some values/hobbies and had good conversation around that to start. We dug into my experience and all around they were very impressed. I was feeling really good -- then near the end they ask me to give them my day-to-day in my last role. Well, this changed a lot depending on what was going on (projects, workload coming in through tickets, one offs, etc) AND it was 2 years ago. I tried explaining it really depended what was going on -- e.g. during project XYZ every morning I would join the meeting to give my updates/talk about issues/propose solutions/etc. then I may end with some free time that I use to dig into XYZ happening in our environment. Or I might dig into automating a manual process that will help drive a project we are working on from there, etc. From there I may check in with my manager or engineers on my team and see if they need a hand with anything. Keep eyes on my email in case I have a new ticket assigned, etc.    
    
Well, I guess this isn't what the founder wanted to hear. There was a pretty big shift after this question -- they more or less replied ""I am really impressed with your technical ability, it's obvious that you look at things from multiple angles and are a great problem solver. But I just don't think you'd be good in the MSP world. I don't know if you'd really be able to handle it coming from the corporate world, and that's kind of why I lead 1st round interviews - to filter that out.""    
    
I honestly was pretty surprised they were this direct. I tried selling myself a little more here by zero-ing in on a time an engineer accidentally removed a dependency from 700 virtual desktops that were utilized by a dept in the company. This broke one of their primary work functions -- and of course we didn't know until about 8:15 AM the next morning. I talked about how the engineers on my team had solutions X,Y,Z and their pitfalls and how I asserted my idea, why I thought it was better, and how it resolved the issue in about an hour and a half (hitting 50% resolve at 45 mins).    
    
From there they just re-iterated how impressed they were with me, but they wanted to move on. They offered to provide my resume to some of their contacts. With hindsight, I realize the founder was probably saying ""1) we're going to overwork you 2) we're going to underpay you compared to a corporation"" and just saving us both time. But it really sucked for me in that moment!

spazzo246,Anyone ever left a job they were too comfortable in? My job is a walk in the park and I'm too comfortable to leave,"Hello. 

In 28 and have Been at my current role for a large retail company on in the internal IT department for 7 years this year. This was my first role out of University

I have moved around different roles and am in a systems administration position. It's rather general role and doesn't really specialise in anything in particular. Whatever the business needs I fix. Active directory, printers, user accounts, routers. Very much a frontline position.

I know everything about the job at this point. My days are long and boring but the pay is really good. I'm not learning anything.

My ex boss contacted me last week about a position at his company. It's a much more specialised position revolving around endpoint deployments with Intune and Jamf. The company is a fairly large MSP in my state.

This job will basically throw me into the deep end and I'll need to start again from scratch. My experience relating to this position is really minor and if I get it I'll really get my hands dirty with Intune and device deployment. I'm kind of doing this now at my current work place however I'm on the very end of the stick. I just build laptops by pressing a few buttons. Have no involvement with creating images or anything beyond basic intune checks. I'm talking level 1 service desk level duties. Other departments are in charge of more complex day to day tasks and fixes. 

The base salary would be similar to what I'm on now but the cieling is much higher than my position. At my current work place my salary is probably the highest it will ever be unless I change departments to a systems engineer/programmer. Which Im definitely not qualified for.

Has anyone left a job that they were generally really comfortable in? Did you stay or did you change? What impacted your decision?

Mrhiddenlotus,"Got a dream job offer after 3 months contract-to-hire with another job, don't know how to phrase my resigation.","About 3 months ago I was fielding a couple offers from 3 companies. I rejected one for low balling me, which left 2. My dream job ended up having to retract their offer due to some confusion about the person they were replacing actually quitting (I knew this was conditional from the start, no bait and switch, they were very transparent with me). I told dream job that if something opens up while I'm still on contract for the only job offer left, to let me know.

Fast forward to this week, dream job emailed me asking if I was still interested, which I am. And I do plan on taking it.

My question is how I should phrase my resignation from my contract position. The timing is pretty close as my conversion to full time from this contract would be on Monday.

I want to offer 2 weeks notice, because that's typically the right thing to do. I don't mind if they just let me go however. They've been great to me, the pay and benefits are essentially equivalent. I just want to do the other job more.

ALovelyLotus,I'm a mother of 2 young children looking to get started in IT. Please help!,"First some background. As stated in the title I have 2 young children and I'm a military spouse so I will likely move every few years. I had my children young so I have no education beyond a high school diploma or relevant job experience for IT. I've tried going the traditional route and going to a local college to earn a degree but...it honestly felt impossible to do with my children. Daycare is expensive and at the moment I can't find a job that even pays enough to cover the cost of daycare (for context at my previous job I made 750-1000/mo). 

I've heard a lot of great things about tech and that after earning a few certs I should be able to find a job that will pay more than what I have access to now. I've read through the wiki and I'm thinking of starting with A+, Net+, and Sec+. What is a realistic timeline to earn these 3 certs? How long should I expect to spend preparing for them? Once I get them should I start looking for a Help Desk job? Also, assuming I earn these certs and get an entry level job what should my next step be once I gain some experience? I know there are lots of different areas of tech but I'm not sure where to start and what would be flexible for my situation. Long term I'm looking for something that won't be too hard to find a job with as I may be moving pretty regularly for my husbands military career.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645727321

bubbling_under,11+ yrs in application support and networking/routing/switching. What are my options ?,"I sometimes feel that I am done with networking and supporting legacy applications for 11+ years.

If I study, I am pretty sure I will be able to crack the interviews related to core networking but I'm having second thoughts.

However, public cloud skills seem to be in demand.

I have completed my AWS-SAA C02 certification.

I know how to setup a basic web application in AWS involving EC2, RDS, Route53, VPC, Security groups and Route tables.

Also know how to write basic cloud formation template for EC2 instance, security groups and VPCs.

I can write small lamdba function code that queries the RDS database and returns the result when user triggers the API Gateway URL.

Is there a possibility I can switch to cloud domain with such high experience and no previous cloud experience ?

Please suggest. Would love to hear if anybody did a similar kind of transition.

ChocoboNuggets,What is the best way to answer this interview question? (Entry level help desk position),"I recently had a panel interview for a entry level help desk position at a university. One of the Directors of IT asked something along the lines of: 

""Describe how and in what order you would help in this situation if they happened simultaneously:

1. Ticket about a professor who's projector is not showing anything
2. Ticket about Head of IT who cannot access their email
3. Ticket about a TA whose printer isn't working
4. A walk up customer approaches""

I said something along the lines of:

First, I would ask the walk up customer if they can wait for a little bit as there is an extremely urgent issue going on and apologize.

Then I would try to resolve the Head of IT email access ticket.

Then I would ask the walk up customer about their issue and determine if it would take long or if it's a quick fix.

If it's a quick fix, I would help the walk up customer. If it would take long, I would ask them to wait a little longer and apologize again.

Resolve the ticket with the professor.

Help the walk up customer.

Then resolve the ticket with the TA whose printer is not working.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure exactly what the answer is, can someone please elaborate?

&amp;#x200B;

And, I did pretty poorly on one of the questions (not the one above) and it was obvious that I didn't do well to answer that one. So after the interview, in my follow up email saying ""Thank you"" etc., I said if I could have gone back in time to answer that question again, I would have said, ""...."".

I recently left active duty Army and was accepted into a unique job role as a government civilian for the  Air Force. It is a GS13 position doing primarily Helpdesk and cloud management. The position supports software engineers on multiple Air Force applications.

Coming out of the Army I got a 6 month internship with Microsoft to help me transition out of the Army. They gave me professional development classes and we learned a lot about Microsoft proprietary products. I am awaiting interview results from Microsoft for a full time position.

I am unsure if I should accept the Microsoft offer or stick with the federal government. I know federal is more secure job wise, has a pension and 401K. BUT Microsoft offers training and a higher annual salary.

I am happy with either! Its been stressful trying to decide between the 2! Stick with Federal and have stability, continue service to my country (in some capacity) but less pay OR go private with more pay, more opportunities to grow but longer hours, and a cut throat work environment?

KodeineKid99,Looking to move from Service Desk to Applications Support Analyst. What can I expect?,"Hey guys. Thanks in advance. Looking for people who have been in an Applications Support Analyst role and was wondering if it would be a good fit for me.

BACKGROUND: I have a CS degree from a small school. Graduated at the start of COVID. Spent a year looking for a job and took a help desk one. Now 6 months into my 2nd position. Current job is moving locations to where I can't commute when needed.

Currently I work in Service Desk at a health care company. I do the normal Service Desk stuff but tends to overstretch as we are a very small IT team. I put entries into the SQL database and provide T2 support to company specific programs.

Due to reasons with the company I am interviewing for an Applications Support Analyst role at another health care company. This position will deal with their software and hospital EHRs. I have some experience with EHRs but not too much. The hiring manager said it would also have SQL involved to troubleshoot for issues within their system.

The hiring manager seems really excited about my applications and I'd put money on them offering me the job soon.

The position is a 20% raise approximately and if given the chance I will 100% take it. I am just wondering some questions.

Where I can go from here? Is an Applications Support Analyst more of a customer support role? Would you consider this a step up? Have you worked in a similar position and have some advice?

Thehan47,Worried I may be leaving my first job too soon for something better/different,"Hey guys as the title says I am currently considering leaving my current job that I've been full time at for about 9 months now. Some background on me I am a recent 4 year graduate with an MIS degree. During high school I worked at a neighboring school district's IT department and helped with their network team and assisted with internal ticket issues. In college I spent 2 summer and 2 winter breaks at my current company doing a lot of networking, database/web development, and internal support. I do enjoy my current company and the majority of people that I work with but there are some seriously worrying signs for me at the moment. 

My team is fairly small, under 10 people, and we have now lost 2 people to other jobs within 3 months. One of those being our boss/leader/manager and essentially my mentor. When I was brought on full time after graduating my boss put me fully on customer project work (mostly consisting of networking focus with some sys admin features to it as well). This was honestly a dream role for me as I was able to do everything that I enjoyed in IT and had experience with from previous internships/jobs/general interests. When he left I was left to take charge of our existing customer facing jobs (something that my team has always been involved with). Now that he is gone, upper management seems to be moving my team fully to a help desk ticketing role. This is not something that I was brought on for or am really interested in. During contract negotiations and interviewing it was heavily stressed that I would first and foremost be project based and involved with the networking for them with some of my time allocated to help the team with ticketing. I do not mind handling the ticket queue at all but it is not what I want to be doing long term nor is it what I was hired for. When asking about future project roles I've gotten a very different answer than it has been in the past in that our focus would be shifting to internal first, then if there is time development, and if we have left over hours we are allowed to assist with projects. 

Because of all of this I have been looking around at other roles, mostly junior/associate network engineer/administrator ones. This is an area that I am really interested in and have the most experience in and want to continue with. I really don't see the opportunity to continue doing this at my current company. I'm afraid that this may be seen as job hopping and won't reflect well on my resume for future employers. I also do want to get stuck doing a job where I get next to no experience for the role I want to have down the line. Another thing that is pushing me to apply is to start over to a degree. I've been in the same state my entire life and have spent most of the past few years at this same company. Living in a new area with a new job seems like it would be really freeing. (The pay increase from posted and estimated salaries that I'm seeing too help a lot also!)

I've been working here for about 9 months and recently had a kid. I'm looking to up my salary soon due to costs associated with the kid. I'm also wanting to move somewhere in the southern US to have warmer weather but when I look for jobs I can't make up my mind what position to apply for.

I'm 31 with a bachelor's degree in networking, After college, I started as an IT Tech for 6 years for the government going above and beyond by doing sysadmin roles (scripting, server admin, and networking) as well as learning controls programming (Allen Bradley PLCs). I then got a job as a sysadmin/software dev at a non-profit that had custom software internally as well as their shopping website. I overhauled the network/servers there and developed C# programs to help internal processes and the custom shopping website ([ASP.net](https://ASP.net)). I mostly programmed at this job in C# and did some database management of the Oracle DB used by the website and internal apps. After working there for a couple of years I decided to have a kid and change jobs to a school district for $65k as the IT director. I knew this was low for an IT director but I knew it would be good for my skill set. I currently manage one helpdesk employee. I've replaced the firewall, network switches, servers, and voip since I started. I've hired a few temps to do repetitive work when needed. 

Anyways, I know if I stay in this small town, my salary won't change and I won't live where it's warm. I'm willing to go in any direction with my career but I'm looking for suggestions. Any help would be awesome!",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645671929

roaringhiccups,I am 3rd year BS IT student considering going for MS IT,"Hello everyone! I am currently a 27 year old woman in my junior year pursuing my BS in IT. If all goes well, I am a year away from graduating. 
Over the past few months I have been debating whether or not I should pursue my masters in IT. My university offers an accelerated masters program (4+1), therefore some of my senior year courses would be replaced with grad level courses, which would then only leave me 1 additional year of schooling to get my MS. 
One of my professors that has sort of been my mentor &amp; used to be the program chair of IT has really been telling me I should go for my masters. His reasons are that I get it in 1 year instead of 2, it would set me apart from other applicants in the job market, the pay would be higher, &amp; that “it can’t hurt” to get it. 
That being said, I’ve spoken to other professors in IT, as well as other students in IT, &amp; the feedback is mixed. 
The ones against MS IT say IT is a technical field, &amp; an additional year in school wouldn’t benefit me all that much. It’s also more in loans, and another year foregoing pay &amp; experience. 
If I want to enroll in this accelerated masters program, I would have to decide before the end of this semester (May).

JCsLearning,Looking to move into Cyber - Currently an IT Field Tech,"Hello everyone,

As the title states, I'm currently a Field IT Technician for a company in my local area. I'm a student at WGU, pending graduation in July with a Bachelor of Science in Cyber Security and Information Assurance. I started my Bachelor's program last year, and only transferred in a few classes, so I can definitely sell myself to a company as a fast learner.

I've currently obtained my CySA+, Sec+, Net+, A+, Project+, and ITIL Foundations certifications. In the next few weeks, I am testing for SSCP and will have obtained Pentest+ by June.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been an IT Field Tech for 6 months, learning much more than I ever thought I would, and I am hoping to move into an Analyst, preferably a SOC/NOC Analyst, position in the, hopefully, near future.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest hold-up right now is that I have no other relevant experience that would make me a good candidate on paper. I know that I will be a great asset to any company, and I am willing to work and learn as much as it takes to be just as great as anyone else on the team...but I have yet to really see any companies that take on junior or entry-level positions. Most of them seem to require 3-5 years of experience and a Bachelor's at the very least.

My second biggest hold-up is where I live. There doesn't seem to be any cyber/tech firms here that even have SOC/NOC positions because they have other companies handle that for them. I'd love to have an in-house position, but it seems like I'll have to take on a remote position...which is going to be a hard sell to a company.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know of a company that hires on truly junior/entry-level positions remotely? I've heard of a few firms that hire new grads and put them through a 2-year contract where they place you somewhere, but I don't know if that would be worthwhile. I'm not too worried about finding a job immediately because I do have a great stable job right now, but I am hoping to move up in my career around the time that I am finishing my degree in July.

-ci_,Anyone from Vegas on this sub? What is the IT industry like here in 2022?,"Yes, I used the search bar already. I saw some posts asking the same question but there weren't many responses in any of the threads and a lot of them were kinda old.

I'm currently working remote tech support for a router company and I'm at a bit of a crossroads. I'm trying to get into the plumbers/pipefitters union in my area but getting into the union is very competitive - so if I don't get into the union this time around, I plan on going balls deep into IT and possibly even enrolling at WGU.

The only thing that has me a bit hesitant about this is that the IT job market out here seems pretty barren. This is just my perspective though from the outside looking in. I'm obviously not very established in the field yet so it's hard for me to get a real idea of what it's really like. When I go on sites like Indeed or LinkedIn and search for higher-level jobs, the results don't exactly instill a lot of optimism. Lots of them have pretty low wages relative to the workload and tech jobs in this city don't seem plentiful at all.

It seems that gaming and casino jobs are the only thing that's out here and I've heard nothing but negative things about them. From what I've heard, the pay sucks and you're expected to be on-call 24/7.

Anyways, if there is anyone from Vegas on this sub, I'd love to hear from y'all. I would like to know what I'm getting myself into if I end up going down this route. I really don't have any interest in relocating. I can't imagine living anywhere else (was born and raised here) and I have things that I can't afford to leave behind.

TheAspiringGoat,My advice on how to level up your IT career: Cloud Edition!," **TLDR:** Coding/scripting, server administration, networking fundamentals, and building sample/test projects in the cloud are important skills!  


Hi all, I’ve just celebrated my one year of working at a cloud company, and I thought I’d put together a post that gives IT generalists or new IT people an idea of the skills and knowledge to go after if you want to work in a cloud position.  
**Just a disclaimer:** when I say “cloud position”, I am referring to a technical one. There are actually tons of different paths to the cloud such as Sales and Project Management, but I don’t have experience with those sections of the cloud, so I won’t be discussing them. This post is for those that want to be engineers in the cloud, and perform technical duties.

**My path/history in case anyone wants to know:** Desktop Support &gt; Application Support &gt; Server Support &gt; Cloud Support Engineer &gt; Technical Account Manager

**Intended audience of this post:** IT generalists that haven’t found a specialization. This includes positions such as: **Help Desk/Service Desk, Tech Support, Desktop Support, JR Sys Admin, Sys Admin, etc.**

**People that could still benefit from this post in some way:** Those that are looking to make a move to IT, are new to the field, or are already in semi-specializes roles like DBA, Network Engineer/Admin, etc.

  
***The Meat of The Post***

So here are the skills I recommend you work on if you want to work in a cloud position.

**Just FYI:** These are not in any particular order:

1. **Coding/Scripting:** now that I work in the cloud, I see this skill being used all the time. Learn a coding language or scripting language and get comfortable with reading code and being able to know what the basic gist of the code is. If you get a technical position working with cloud and don’t know how to code or how to read code, you’re not going to have a fun time.
2. **Server Administration:** this will be skills such as learning **PowerShell** for Windows servers, **Bash/shell** for Linux/Unix servers, and knowing the role that servers play in the internet and in enterprise setups. You most likely will be using configuration management tools to run commands over many servers at one time, either to perform maintenance tasks, to extract information from an app on the server, or the server itself, and knowing the syntax for doing these tasks will make things way easier.   
Server administration knowledge will also give you an idea of what’s going on with architecture, and how the flow of data is looking within your environment.
   1. **Windows server VS Linux/Unix:** Linux/Unix is more common and is the operating system that practically runs the world, but knowing the Windows stuff could give you some nice specialist knowledge.
   2. Server administration will also teach a super duper important sub-skill: **Logging and Monitoring.** When you work in the cloud and work with tons and tons of virtual machines or other cloud compute services, databases, etc, you’ll want to know if anything goes wrong with them and be able to pull up logs to see what’s going on with them.
   3. **Note:** I am going to put Database knowledge in this category as a bonus, because most apps in the cloud are going to have some sort of database they record data into, and it would be useful to know **SQL** and understand how databases work.
3. **Networking Fundamentals:** For this skill, I am referring to understanding the flow of data within a computing environment, and the internet. An example would be knowing how a 3-tier web app works, or understanding what goes on behind the scenes when you input a website into your browser. Where does the information go? What networking/server devices play a role in the data exchange? This skill is all about understanding network traffic and how it flows. 
4. **Building in The Cloud:** What I don’t mean by this - you just spinning up a VM in the cloud and installing a WordPress site on it. While that is a good first step, what I mean for this skill is to try and build whole app architectures in the cloud, or even go next-level and try to build an app with **container services, serverless services, or managed services (or a combination!)**. Now, you don’t have to make these architectures large, they can be small so that you don’t incur too much cost in your cloud test environment.
   1. Go search the internet for cloud projects you can do, try them all and truly research and understand not only how to build it, **but why it’s built the way it is**, what’s going on behind the scenes, and **how could you make it better**.
   2. Getting certifications for the big cloud providers does give you a good start with the cloud, but supplement with getting some **hands on and building stuff**.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645650255
MisterPuffyNipples,How many of you have dealt with bullying from senior technicians?,"One particular tech whose overall personality is like shaking a wasp nest and then sticking your head in has been talking about me right behind my back.

lilrebel17,"Advice about swapping jobs, when to swap and if there is a timeframe I need to abide by.","Morning IT Redditors.

Im faced with a pretty serious decision and want to get some opinion from other folks in the field. Let me start from the beginning. I have been doing hardware replacement and field service for about three years. I then transitioned to my current position doing IT Support. I have been here at my current position less than a year(A little over 8 months). Problem is, I just got asked to interview and have a real chance at getting in with our local school system doing Field Service on their networks. I have swapped jobs about every year or so the past three years and feel its way to soon to swap again alongside that, I would be transitioning to networking, which is what I want to do, I think we all know its where some serious money can be made in our field. I would be going on salary, working way less and have much better benefits. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im scared though. I don't exactly have a background in networking, while I do have expertise in running cable, hardware replacement, and help desk. So redditors my question is simple. Am I swapping jobs to much if I take this one? Is there really a downside to swapping constantly, I know the older generation isn't about that at all, but from my experience it seems like the best way to keep progressing. And a more off topic question, for those who do work with their local school systems, is it worth it? Or is it just so stress filled it becomes more burdensome?",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645647585

Im going up 10k$ up yearly! That is huge since I only got my first job 7 months ago. But Im very hesitant.. Both are in the public sector

My work now:

Its mainly IT support with calls. The calls are ok but its beginning to be a little boring. The only way I have survived there is that my colleagues and bosses are great. Same age and relaxed environment ( everyone helps eachother and enough pressaure) Im only hired in for the time being.

New Job:

Its both IT support on chat and onsite. I have no idea how the workers are there since its a pretty secret business.

So for the possibilities in each job.

I think its more possibilities in my current job since its much bigger. We have our own Support Desk, Backup and retrival group, AD Administrators, IT operations. Deployment, and Buidling Network and Network Analytics. Applications. They are supporting and making everything there. Possible for working night since its need to be up everyday = more money.

On the other I just think its Support down to ""3 line"" not so much making just supporting. But I will be able to drive some and change scenery.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I feel most for the job I have now actually. 

Reason to change:

* More money 10$ k +
* IT support and Onsite
* Permanent position

Reason to stay:

* Very good enviroment
*  possibilities to learn more technical stuff.
* Minus: Only hired in
   * \+ Boss says its a chance to get  permanent position there when its allowed with the same wage as the new job.

Since offices are closed due to Covid and we have been given an option to either come back to office or permanently work from home forever. 

Now I would want to switch to another company later this year, so if I opt for WFH at my current job will I face any issues in switching to another non-remote job (where they would ask me to come and work at office) during interviews as I haven't worked in office in my short career.

cptvenezuela,How Much PTO is Normal? Are you Guys getting More?,"I’m curious if my situation is abnormal or if I’m just being picky and wanting more. 

So I get 8 hours of PTO per pay period. Which basically comes out to 20 days a year. Some would say that’s great. The downside is I gotta use my own PTO for holidays. So Christmas or New Year’s I would have to use one of my PTO days. I don’t know about you guys, but my two previous jobs just gave us paid holidays. I figure that’s kinda normal. 

What got me thinking about this, is because my friend landed a job as a sys admin with Unlimited PTO and my girlfriend recently  landed a job with Unlimited PTO in sales.  

Incase it’s relevant, I work as a sys admin making $60k in Virginia. Don’t know if that’s relevant to how much PTO would be appropriate.

Huckleberry58,Aged 63 male and looking to rebuild IT career. Looking for advice.,"I have been in and out of IT for 30 years. During all that time, I mainly did tech support, desktop support, managed services and so forth. Nothing as a true network or server admin. I learned as I went.  
My last job was doing tech support for a security company (I did not support the AV product). I quit January 21st due to stress caused by understaffing of our group and because the company had been bought and sold twice in the space of the 6 years I was there.

Since quitting, I have taken some time to think about what I really want to for a career for the rest of my life. I have decided to stay in IT, but do a couple of other non-IT things as side gigs.

Regarding IT, even though I have Network+ and Security+ certifications from 2010, I feel my knowledge and skills have waned since then. I received these certs before CompTIA changed it so they expire (I earned the certs before December 31,2010). So technically they are still good. But so much has changed since then, I thought maybe I should get certified in them again. I also am trying to decide on what direction in IT I want to pursue. I have narrowed it down to 3:

  
\-- Networking - After refreshing my knowledge with Network+, then pursue Cisco certs  
\-- Linux - Take the Linux+ course, then get certified in Red Hat.

\-- Security - Take the Security+ over again as a refresher, then try for CISSP.

Would it be a good idea to take the Network and Security again, even though they are still valid?  
Of the 3 directions I listed, is there one more in demand than the other, and which of them would give the highest financial rewards? I am the Dallas area, and it seems like everything is hot.

Are there any other branches of IT I should consider? I don't really want to program, but I at least should learn some scripting. Seems there is a lot of jobs requiring Python.

Any assistance would be appreciated.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645629179
Dukoduko,Help a student make a decision - Service desk specialist or Data annnotation.,"So here it goes. (Just a little disclaimer, English isn't my native language)

I'm a CS student, currently on my 4th year (out of 5) and have actively been looking for a new job in the past month. Currently have the opportunity to work 3 jobs.   


Service desk specialist - includes night shifts, best pay (immediately), possibility of advancing in the field.

Data annotator - completely entry level position but the company has intern job opportunities for people who want to get into development/data analysis etc. 

Help desk - least attractive one, just a general help desk for a government company, handle e mails/calls etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm in a pretty big dilemma, mainly concerning the first two jobs, in the long run they're 2 completely different careers and I just simply don't know enough about any of those 2 for me to know exactly which one suits me or not. 

So let's go over the pros and cons:  
Service desk - PROS: very good pay (immediately), smaller company (I think people just tend to learn more in smaller companies unlike massive ones where companies have huge IT departments where every single person has their repetitive small chores that they do, becoming a one trick pony basically), the company says you can advance which results in higher position and money

CONS: NIGHT SHIFTS, working with people which might have very stupid inquiries

&amp;#x200B;

Data annotation - PROS: very flexible working hours, the company says they have a lot of internal job opportunities where they quite often look at their data team/students for possible talent after they graduate, this includes jobs in development, data science, NLP etc. 

CONS:  the pay is worse (currently), monotonous as fuck, I am not so sure about advancing because they hire a massive amount of students and I just simply can't stop thinking that it's kind of a trap, they basically employed a massive amount of students in the past year and intend to double it in the next year, I kind of have a hard time seeing me advance to a higher paying job or position in a sea of 300 students all wanting to prove themselves. So I just have a feeling it might be a trap so they get a huge influx of data annotators to better their systems and AI.  


I myself really have no idea which career I would prefer out of those two. So if anyone here has a tip/advice, basically anything to try and help and solve my dilemma, please do tell!",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645628061
GamesMusicWeed,Looking for suggestions on how to improve answering aptitude style interview questions for IT sysadmin/IT management type roles,"I recently had a disappointing interview experience with an interviewer. I was expecting them to be a strong technical person that I could have a bit more of an open ended conversation with to learn more about the role and the fit, however they instead preferred to turn the 1 hour interview strictly into an exercise of rattling off non-stop aptitude questions while taking notes.  

While that interview has helped me identify some areas for improvement on my end, I feel that in the real world I have had years of success in demonstrating much of the aptitudes and attributes that they are actually looking for but I’m just apparently not very good at explaining it to an interviewer with the job title “IT Solutions Manager”who hasn’t RDP’d into an actual server for many years. 


Questions like:

“How would you describe your change management process” 

“Tell me about your most recent technical challenge and how did you solve it?”


I found myself stumbling on these types of questions because I went too far into technical details that they didn’t understand or care about to begin with. It was clear that they were looking for very specific types of answers that were more generic and addressed processes and approach from a high level.

I do really want to get better at articulating my responses for these types of questions  in the future, but I’m unsure on the best way for me to practice them. Are there online resources that I can turn to to help prep me to best answer these types of questions?

Busy_Standard3781,Struggling with feeling disconnected with team and inadequate,"Hello everyone. I’ve been doing IT for about four years now, I was in the service industry for the past 4 years. I’m 28 now and I started out with help desk. I loved having a team to talk with and bounce ideas off of. I eventually stepped up as a leader role as more people left the help desk. That was for 2 years and now I’ve moved into my current spot working as a sysadmin on-site for the past 2 years. I have 3 other co-workers at the other sites. I’m finding that I hate communicating via slack. I can’t read what my co-workers reactions are, I barely know them as we all work in different corners of the state. I go through a rollercoaster of emotions every few months where I feel useful and if I make a small mistake, I hear about it at my quarterly review. I also got told within my first six months that I need too much hand holding and to quit bugging people, I do like to talk through my issues and if I’m alone, I occasionally may reach out in chat with my thought and ask if others would be on the same train of thought. This occurs maybe once a week but I get anxiety every time I start to type. I’m worried that I’m asking too many questions but I am super cautious. Now I go through my day and resolve any issues the clients may have on my own, the client loves me, I have days where I don’t need anything.
I have one mistake and it always comes up in review. My coworkers all like to play how they “get shit done, I’m very good at what I do” but I just don’t like to frame myself like that. I want to always keep learning and say yes to extra projects.

Anyways, I just feel like I don’t fit in, I understand out of my team, I don’t have ten years of business IT under my belt and I don’t disrespect that. 

But how does one get over the anxiety? I think this on-site remote stuff isn’t for me. I need faces to read.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645626117
hostchange,New System Administrator looking to improve skills quickly,"About a month ago, I recently made the jump from Desktop Support to System Administrator at my current company.  I still have limited access to things at work, no lab environment currently and the senior System Admin I work with is really slow at showing me anything because he is currently overloaded.  Also I feel that I need more hands on but the training is mostly ""look at my computer screen and watch me do things""

Pretty much all I am doing all day is imaging computers, watching him do things, and supporting users, so not a whole lot has changed.  It's only the two of us supporting this particular building right now, no other IT staff.  The company also did not give me a raise with the title change so I'm being paid well under the floor of what a System Administrator would make in my area.  I'm told that ""its coming in a few months"" but I already have a long list of complaints against my company and don't trust their word.  My manager is at least trying to fight it because I'm grossly underpaid based on his research (and my own)

Just a quick background on what I'm currently doing, I'm starting to work through the book Learn Powershell in a Month of Lunches, and as far as certs go I have the trifecta but no vendor specific certs.  I have downtime during the day to level up skills, just not sure the order or specific I need to focus on to quickly improve my overall situation.  

If you were in my situation, what would you do to learn as much as possible quickly so I can job hop or negotiate a better situation with my company?

gloritown7,Any advice for the technical interview on-site for the Cloud Support Associate Position at AWS?,"Hi,
Not sure if it’s allowed posting questions like this here so please excuse my ignorance.
I'm  19 years old and recently finished my RHCSA and have completed my CCNA  back in August. I creating my linkedin profile about 2-3 weeks ago and  applied for a cloud associate position at AWS. They offered me an  interview which i gladfully accepted and which I passed yesterday. It was  fairly simple in my opinion just questions about DNS, DHCP and a few about Linux commands and Linux security. The interviewer also commended me a few times and mentioned  that I should pass the next on-site virtual interview with ease.

However  since this was literally my first interview ever and the next one will  be my first on-site technical interview I'm getting a bit scared... When  I asked on what topics I should focus to prepare for the interview the  interviewer mentioned that it will basically be the same topics but  going a bit deeper...?

Does this  mean I would need to configure a few services or just explain it in more  detail? Since I never configured any ""real"" network service on a linux  machine because it wasn't part of the exams I took, I am worried that I  will be in a situation where I will be panickly looking into man  pages... The technical part of the interview will be 3 hours which makes  me feel certain that I will need to configure something. Are there any tips or tricks that can help me out? Is it normally allowed to google in a networking technical interview? What should I do at home to prepare?

My  first thought would be to just configure a few services like DHCP DNS  etc. on a linux virtual machine however it doesn't feel quite right  since I don't know which exact software they will tell me to use.  Basically I am bit confused and would like to have some advice on how to  prepare.

At the current juncture, my ""experience"" is I'm studying for my A+ and I feel like I can Google what I don't immediately understand, which makes me think I could continue to teach myself things without constantly asking questions I should be able to figure out myself. BUT, knowing myself as I do, I'm going to have to really color within other people's lines and try to reproduce previous experiences and stuff like that.

I mean, studying on Duolingo, I remember one time one of the sentences to translate was, ""My three cats cleaned the bathroom last weekend,"" which is practically nonsense, but I think their point is if you know the vocabulary and you know the rules of the language, you can put real sentences together yourself. Which my point is, by analogy, that's not something I'm so good at. I more repeat phrases and sentences I've already heard like The Dude in *The Big Lebowski*.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645589686

The minimum requirements we seek:
• Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering or closely related field of study
• 2+ years of programming experience (internships and coursework allowed)

• Masters or PhD degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering or closely related field of study
• Experience writing software, API
• Showed strengths in oral, written, interpersonal communication in a collaboration work setting

Current job:

* mid-high 5 fig
* access security + sys admin things + some soc duties + some audit prep + documentation writing.
* pretty chill for what the pay at
* team  is small. My mentor is only my boss but they are very busy with  meetings. Most of the time I am left alone to come up with solutions and  do whatever. Other team members don't do the same things as me. I feel  like a lone wolf.
* some  technicalness to the position but sometimes felt like an exec.  assistant to the boss. Doing whatever audit doc, project managements  there are to do.
* hybrid - 1 day onsite, 4 days remote

New job offer:

* little over 6 fig
* guess it would be much busier than current job
* bigger team, more mentorship opp. from others on the team
* SOC duties 100%
* hybrid - 4 days onsite 1 day remote

What do you think? What would you do if you were me?

Sitting  in traffic 4 days a week is a concern. Losing the stability of the  previous job is a concern, past initial eval. period already, I am not  going anywhere there. Treading into new job is an unknown.

But not taking the 6 fig offer I would be crazy. The increase justified the traffic.

discourged_31,Any reply would be great my post pretty much explains my life at 32,"I’m fairly new to this space. I have contemplated changing career fields for the longest. I earned my Comptia Sec + and my ITIL v4 a few years ago. Unfortunately, I didn’t earn a position doing IT. Not because of effort on my part.  But largely due to my
Wife’s career in the military and our small
Children. I did have tons of offers for contract
Positions in DC, Afghanistan, etc

Two years later I’m ready to sacrifice and get this career rolling. Im a veteran I no longer have a clearance anymore. I have an M.A. in organizational leadership. And my profession at this point is HR I’m a mid level professional. 

I hope i don’t come off as ignorant.  I need to be in a field that I can show my three boys, hey you don’t have to join the military or pursue a worthless degree plan. I want to show them all the endless opportunities this field can bring on top of compensation.

So, I’m using my earned military education benefits and starting training from the ground up. A+ Net+ Sec+ and a few more courses. Program is six months long. I’m aware of certs and I’m aware better certs exist. However, this program is a VA partnered program. Meaning they don’t receive payment for my studies to i purse meaningful employment. 

I’m sure I will start at Help Desk and that’s fine. I can kiss my 80k good bye. But I have a military retirement of around 52kish.. so, I’ll live.

mrdodo,Transitioning between Web Development and IT focused roles,"I have been mulling over my current situation that I am hoping maybe some more experienced IT folks could lend some input in. 

For context, I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in '08, working for a number over years in school at a computer lab, eventually as a SysAdmin, and then took an internship doing mostly IT related tasks for a large corporation (racking servers, Linux system maintenance, small scripts, etc). Once I graduated I worked full time for a couple of years in DevOps/SysAdmin roles and then picked up Ruby on Rails in 2010 and have predominately been doing full stack web development since then. Currently, I have decided to take a bit of a semi-sabbatical working part time freelancing web development while I explore what my interests are since I have been getting slightly burnt out doing what I have been doing.

My question is around the possibility of shifting back in to more IT/SysAdmin roles given the fact that I haven't been directly working in that space for over a decade now. I find myself getting more interested in that area of tech again (tinkering with home lab setups, cloud computing, Linux administration, etc), but not quite sure what would be the best route if I wanted to actually start exploring jobs in that area again. Would it be a waste of time to do things like certifications, or might that help bridge my knowledge gap and demonstrate a competency without any direct work experience? Should I just start applying to lower level IT jobs given my technical background and work my way up? I fear that I wouldn't really pass initial screenings even with the experience I have.

GamesMusicWeed,I had a first job interview where they rushed me through a checklist of questions and hardly gave me an opportunity to ask questions of my own. Is this a red flag?,"Hello fellow redditors! I made a post recently about an [exciting new opportunity](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/sv1e25/interviewing_for_a_job_that_pays_40_more_at/) and I had the first interview this morning. To be clear, there was no screening phone call prior to this so this was the first real interaction I had with them since getting the call to schedule the meeting. 

I went in to the interview with the expectation of it being closer to a conversation, and even tried to crack open that door right at the very beginning of the interview but was shut down right away when the interviewer said ""I really appreciate your enthusiasm, but I have to get through this checklist on my computer in the allotted time"". 

They then hit me with a barrage of behavioural questions along the lines of ""what would you do if X happened"" or ""how would you approach Z situation"". I answered all as quickly and concisely as I could right up until the 59th minute when they said:

""We unfortunately have to wrap things up and we have another meeting coming right up, but do you have any questions?""

I managed to put in a couple of quick questions within a minute and they gave me some very bland answers, then ended the call with ""you can email me if you have more questions, please give us a week or two to get back to you"". 

I think I did a decent job answering the questions (though not perfect), but overall I was pretty unimpressed by the interview because it honestly seemed to me like all they're doing right now is making candidates run through a gamut of predetermined questions and passing along notes. I'm open to the possibility that they simply weren't impressed with me right off the bat or something along those lines and that's why they made things so formal... but I still find that to be odd given that I had a direct recommendation on their side of the fence. 

Based on the interview process so far, it feels like this company culture is rigid and uninspiring to me. Call me naive, but I wanted to be able to have a conversation where I could talk about their pain points and discuss how I could help. 

I don't know if they'll be moving forward with me any further, but even if they did I'm not sure if this is the right fit for me anyway. Am I wrong to feel this way, or is it fair to take this experience as a red flag?

wordsmith8015,Wheelchair Using Noob...would A+ or Sec+ work better to avoid physical limitations?,"I'm a wheelchair user with an unrelated Bachelor's looking to move into IT, and eventually, cybersecurity (leaning toward red team at the moment but that could change. I love the field!)

In July last year I took the Sec+ and failed (656 when I needed at least 750). At that point, I had no hands-on experience with computers. Thinking I'd overshot my skills, I started studying for the A+. I wasn't able to take the exam (made a stupid mistake day of) but in between study sessions I noticed that the majority of in person helpdesk jobs require standing/walking/lifting, which are no-go's for me.

I know that I'm nowhere near ready to start applying for anything due to a lack of certs and skills. Trying to prepare for whatever test I decide to take by using TryHackMe, reading security blogs and books, and teaching myself the fundamentals.

Hexduh,I'm nervous that I've been offered a job after the first interview. need opinions/advice on dealing with recruiters with this process.,"Hi all. I'm looking for opinions or stories if anyone has any experience with something like this. 

I'd like to state that I'm pretty comfortable with my current job as a systems analyst and I've been in this position going on 3 years. I have a good relationship with the people I'm working with and the work load on a normal day to day is pretty low. The only thing that really kicks it here is the pay is lower than I'd like and I've heard the pay raises are normally 1.5% a year. Last year it was 3% and the year that I was hired, we weren't given a raise but a small bonus of like 1.5k USD.

Now a recruiter messaged me with an opportunity and asked if I could interview. So I took that and it was a short 30 minute interview. It went well, and the recruiter had mentioned a second interview would be the next step. But now they have contacted me saying that I've been offered the job. I have to work 6 months contracted through the recruiter and it is a guaranteed hire after 6 months by the company. 

The pay difference is really what I'm worried about. Current job pays me roughly 65k USD with no bonuses or anything like that. The new offer is 94k USD which would be very helpful bills and things of the nature. 

On another note, the recruiter seems very pushy for me to say yes. Not sure if this is because of the nature of their job or what. I've never dealt with a recruiter so I'm out of the loop as far as that goes.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645567274

I moved into a lite sysadmin remote role with an MSP in another state.

It’s a lot in my head but I’ve had one feed back review that stated that I needed to rely less on everyone but mentally I’m walking on eggshells. Now Ive affirmed that everyone is probably finding me annoying. I prefer talking through my actions because I’m terrified of blasting a database away or screwing up a config. Im overly cautious which is my fault and when I duck up, it snowballs into me not even googling something because I feel defeated and low. And I know that’s literally my job but my teammates had nothing to say when I voiced apologies that I’m struggling once or twice.

I’ve been fortunate enough to have a little bit of experience so far through help-desk work with Apple (Tier 1 iOS advisor) and I was an Advanced Repair Agent with Geek Squad until about 3 months ago. 


I currently work as a Help Desk Analyst for a chain of clinics/physician’s offices. There is a lot of potential for growth as the IT department is being fleshed out and I am 1 of 3 technicians. It is a full time remote position, my salary being $48,000/year.

The reasoning for this post is I am wondering what my next step should be? Whether it’s learning a skill that will help me increase my value in this role or if it’s seeking out a new role entirely. I’m happy with my current position but would love to hit $60,000/year so that I can comfortably move out with my girlfriend in the near future. Also wouldn’t mind growing past the help desk level.

Jeffbx,Working remotely from another country - Can I do it?,"This is a hot topic lately, but it's a very complex question with a lot of different answers depending on what you mean.  I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a tax expert, so consult appropriate experts before making any decisions.  But hopefully this will help with the basics:

**I'm a US citizen with a fully remote job.  Can I move to another country and work there while collecting my US paycheck?**

Sometimes, but you always need to check the rules.  You need a visa to live and work in another country, and there's a [small list of places](https://thepointsguy.com/guide/these-are-the-countries-that-will-let-you-work-remotely-abroad/) that specifically welcomes this.  But there are a lot of requirements and they differ, so read up on your chosen country carefully.  

Also be aware of time zone differences, language differences, and healthcare - your company's healthcare plan may or may not cover you, so know the local process for healthcare if you get sick or injured.

**What if I want to live somewhere not on that list?**

Then it gets more complex.  If it's temporary (under 90 days) you can usually get away with working on a tourist visa, especially in US-friendly places.

Longer than that and bigger issues come into play that are mainly around taxes - when you live somewhere, that somewhere will want you to pay taxes based on your income.  If you're living in XYZ country but only paying US taxes, then XYZ will not be happy about that, and your company may face a [permanent establishment risk](https://www.safeguardglobal.com/resources/blog/permanent-establishment-risk). This means that XYZ country can tell your company that YOU are now a 'business location' and your company will have to start following local laws and paying local taxes.  Your company will not be at all happy about that, and you'll probably find yourself jobless very shortly thereafter.

Labor laws are also very strict in some countries, and your company may or may not be able to abide by those, even if you're the only employee in the entire country.

Bottom line - check carefully for the country you're interested in, and be sure your company knows before you decide to go there.  Yes, you can go there without telling them, but then in the event that there's an issue, their first response will likely be to eliminate their liability by letting you go.  

**I'm an XYZ citizen but I want to work remotely for a US company &amp; be paid a US paycheck**

This is not impossible, but it's extremely difficult.  Again, taxes and labor law get in the way.  To answer 99% of curious people - if you're a citizen of another country, a US company will not hire you as a direct employee in your country &amp; pay you a US paycheck.  There are too many legal &amp; tax implications around that, plus the US company has zero incentive to hire non-citizens unless you have some very specific skills that are extremely difficult to find in the US.  There are a few exceptions to this, but most of them wouldn't apply to remote IT jobs.

If there's a local subsidiary of that US company in your country you can get hired through them, but then you'll be paid at the local rate in local currency.

The way you can get around this is by getting hired as an independent contractor.  You'll have to be registered as a business in your country, and sell your services to wherever you want to work.  You can charge whatever you like, but of course the challenge here is selling your services.

Hope that helps - here are a few more resources about it:

Diligent-Shoulder-32,What would my next role be after my current one? What should I be studying?,"Currently I work at a smaller MSP with roughly 5 techs. I've only been here for roughly 3/4 months, but feel like I'm flatlining on my learning process. What would be the next role from (technically) a help desk position? 

I've read Sysadmin/Netadmin, but looking at job reqs, we don't use most of the stuff they require, and I also do not have a Bachelors (and working at an msp, I doubt I'll have one soon). 

Currently I do a lot of different things for my job. Anything from resetting passwords/making new users, installing software, mapping network drives, connecting printers/scanners to resetting the servers, running diagnostics on the servers, setting up LAN/WAN for new offices, maintaining network racks, setting up and using 3cx, o365, RDP, antivirus/phishing software, VPNs, firewalls, and also hardware fixes, such as motherboard/hard drive replacement, and probably more that I can't think of at the moment.

What should I be studying currently? Most of the above I have gotten a good grip on, however after only 3/4 months there's some things I could be studying more of, so should I focus on learning those? Should I use my free time trying to learn the things we don't use? Thanks for any tips.

FullStackRetail,Resume Review (Helpdesk or Entry/Jr level position seeking),"[https://imgur.com/a/B3EXFzi](https://imgur.com/a/B3EXFzi)

I'm currently transitioning out of Retail with the hope of starting in a Help desk or an entry-level data analyst position whilst I finish my A+ certification and continue to grow. I tried to keep it one page but wanted to lean heavily on things I'd done previously in IT more than retail so that perhaps draws their eye to that area and doesn't leave them with an ""oh he doesn't know anything about IT"" or possibly mistake front-end supervisor as a Retail Front-End supervisor (unfortunately this happened to me in a retail setting interview previously). This is the third iteration of my resume where I'm trying to focus on what I did specifically, not just where I worked and generalized tasks as I've noticed this sub suggests doing. I also type at 100+ WPM but not sure it's worth noting?

I have experience with a bunch of ""keyword"" type situations like Joomla, WordPress, Zapier, Intercom, Postback setups, and more but was worried I'd already gone overboard with the wording. My LinkedIn profile has 32 skill assessments passed (mostly coding, server, and software-based, but also including word/office/excel/etc) so I didn't want to go overboard and mention those here either but I'm guessing they may help get through filters on Helpdesk roles?. My Indeed has ""Expert and Highly Proficient"" for all skills. But thus far I've noticed no one looks at your LinkedIn profile so doubt those are actually useful, perhaps for recruiters?

I have more managerial (ASM) experience in small-box retail but figured anything beyond 12 years isn't worth including and will only add to the page count. Currently, the resume is 1.5 pages.

**Any feedback is appreciated!**

rudyxp,"I am experienced, burnt out, unemployed and I have no idea how to fix it","Hey everyone.

I am an IT guy with over 4 years of experience in 1st and 2nd line support with Computer Networking college degree. Over the last year I have made some dreadful job decisions and that made me burnt out and tired with what I do, even though I used to love it at some point.

My first job was in huge industrial site - refinery. Very busy, a lot of topics, hands full of tasks. I loved the fast paced environment and learned a lot every day. I left this job only after 8 months because management was shit, pay was very shit, and the shift pattern was even more shit. 

From there I moved to a company well known all over the world from jewelry industry. It was also a step from service desk to 2nd line of process support in a junior position. Work conditions improved massively, so did the pay, but my tasks became boring and repetitive, not giving me opportunity to learn a lot of technical skills. I spent 1.5y there and multiple times I spoke to management about giving me something else to do because I can do more, but they were reluctant simple because they had nothing to offer. I decided to leave to do something else, because I was very bored.

Here is where my career takes an unexpected turn - I go to the company where the IT manager is a complete asshole of a guy and is literally mobbing the shit out of the team of great young people. I decided to act, I took some steps and togheter with the team we sack this manager. Even though it was a success, and the team members considered me as the coolest guy in the world for coming out of nowhere and solving basically the biggest problem they ever had, I couldn't work there. Simply too much happened and I just didn't feel right staying and working like nothing ever happened. I left after 2 months. 

I went to another global company - 2nd line of infrastructure support. The job looked again preety boring which also was the factor in what was about to happen next. I had already planned my 2 weeks holiday after 3 weeks in this job and it was all established earlier. I never came back from this holiday - during my time off I've had massive sinus infection which rendered me pretty much deaf for the next 4 weeks. I literally could not hear a person which whom I was having a conversation sitting at the same table. After 4 weeks it started to improve but it took me pretty much 3 months before I was completely fit to work again. 
I came back to work and I noticed something was off. I had nothing to do, no tickets in the system would be assigned to me etc. I got sacked - well, can't blame them on the one side, but on the other my condition was genuine and I had every bit of medical documentation to prove that. Also, I couldn't really care less as the job, the team, the company, they all looked pretty bad to me. After some time I knew, that I only took this job to run from the previous one and that was a mistake.

After that I felt just tired and exhausted with these jobs. I felt like after 4 years of IT support I'm in a dead end because of what I do does not really satisfy me anymore. I would like to try something else, but no other topic in IT  looks really exciting to me. I decided to take some time off.

That was September last year. We are in February now, I've been actively applying to jobs since Christmas, had few interviews (I have one today in a matter of fact) but so far - no luck. It is getting depressing. I am thinking of what other career paths could I pursue? I am really good at troubleshooting, I have ITIL certification, generally everything that I put my hands on becomes simple after a while, I just can't seem to be able to convince any of the employers to that fact. 

Any advices from more experienced colleagues? Maybe an idea about a career path? Any input is much appreciated.

errrrwest,Is it worth taking a break from my current developer job due to unfair treatment (racist) and mental problem,"I'm 24M (black). I have been working as an application developer with 2 years of experience. (1 year QA job)

In my current job, I got hired 5 months ago to a junior position with promising about training and so on, in exchange, my salary, in the beginning, would be fucking low. I accepted. They told me that was all for the challenge.

And in 5 months, I have been doing something that my position has nothing to do with. I accepted to do everything they want, what our customs want, cuz I believe it is challenging to show my will to push the rocks. And there is no ""promising training"", whatever I ask, they pretend to be busy, and when I can make it done alone after 28 hours of restlessness due to ridiculous deadline, they tell me ""That's the spirit, our seniors have taught you well boy"".

I am currently the main developer in a project with ridiculous tasks, no teamwork, no support, only expectation. All the techniques they want me to do in all the projects have nothing to do with my experience or my interest. I forced myself to learn whatever they want to apply my knowledge immediately to the production environment. That exhausted me. 

From Feb, I started facing sleepless nights, I took 2 bottles of coffee every day to keep me stay in the mood. I told this to my best friend, he said nobody on earth makes a junior doing all of this alone without support. My leader only focuses on how to get more bonus salary for him as he is getting more projects for his ""team"" monthly. And my bonus every month is 0, I asked him why, he said ""Because you are a junior"".

And today I just know that my salary is the lowest among all the people here. Even lower than other new-grad juniors (white, asians), they all have mentors with light tasks. They refused to raise my salary due to ""company's income at the moment, it is not a good time but I will promise to raise your salary in next year"" and I felt suck everyday. I can say that I am very diligent, I study whatever they want me to, I just want to be better and make everything done.

I will quit mỵ job before July anyway, I have the plan to move to Canada to live with my mom.

I thought about staying till June but I feel like I can't. If I quit right now, I will spend my time building some personal projects for my portfolio and learning ML, then look for a job in the city where my mom is living.

FlyingSaucer100,Pathways to further education and career progression,"I am relatively new to IT. I started a new job as a systems analyst (Junior level) about 5 months ago in the aviation industry, and my job revolves around doing different things, gathering requirements from users, modifying and refactoring code, developing new code and features/enhancements, creating automated tests, etc. Basically, it is a hybrid between business analysis and software development.

My education background is very non-standard. I come from a background in theoretical physics, where most of my time was spent doing research and creating computer simulations of numerical problems. I never learned anything about Unix or Linux, or about IT in general. I don't know how networks work, I don't know a single thing about protocols or servers, or about cybersecurity. I don't know a thing about cloud computing either, other than it ""being on the cloud"". 

When people mention things like infrastructures to me, I am completely clueless as to what they mean. Literally the only thing I know how to do is do a bit of Python and Bash scripting, and that's about it. Everything else just flies over my head.

I think I am in a tough situation because I am kinda old (e.g. 28) and I just started working in industry for the 1st time in my life. For the past 10 years, I was doing physics at uni (including bachelors and PhD) and I still feel like my mindset is stuck on that. 

I can't say I am passionate about IT, otherwise I would have done a degree in it from the get-go. I mainly ended up in this area because it was the only job I was able to land. Although I still think about doing research or switching to another field, it has become abundantly clear to me that there is no future for me in academia or in physics as a whole: there simply is no demand in those fields and I can't continue to dream forever of a job that doesn't exist.

Having said that, I think that I will stay in IT as I already have a bit of familiarity with it. The issue is, I feel like I am lagging behind a lot compared to coworkers who have a strong IT background, e.g. a Master's in it as well as many years experience in the industry. 

I would like to enhance my knowledge and skills in the industry, but I don't think this job alone can do that for me. A lot of my work includes data entry and doing manual tasks (e.g. updating files through a Linux terminal, checking that emails get sent properly, giving new users access to certain applications, running IT support tasks every few weeks, etc.). As far as ""programming"" goes, I actually don't do much. In 5 months here, I have maybe written 200 lines of code in total, the rest is just talking to customers and trying to understand what they want.

What would you recommend for someone like me in terms of further learning and upskilling? I feel super lost, and I doubt I will be a ""well-seasoned professional"" anytime soon. Are there any certifications/degrees I should do?",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645492154

I'm looking to get an entry level helpdesk role in the UK to get back into IT and was wondering which certs would help at the very least, to get me to the interview stage. I've done some very basic IT jobs before for charities but that was nearly 10 years ago. In terms of my IT knowledge, I'm the ""IT Guy"" in the family, can build a PC, know my way around Windows for the most part so, generic IT knowledge.  I've dabbled with JAVA coding before and have used VMs in the past to do stuff in Linux here and there.

I'm currently unemployed and I have been given up to £400 of funding for exams

I was going to go for A+, N+ and Sec+ then cover extra costs myself but there seems to be mixed signals regarding Comptia certs on here when it comes to their worth in the UK. My other idea was to go for MD100 and MD101 - Modern Desktop Administrator Associate but there seems to be little talk about it on here when I searched.

I live in London. For jobs starting at £20-27k, the most common things I see in job descriptions for First Line/Helpdesk roles is Server/Active Directory, Office 365 knowledge, GSuite. A few others mention SCCM too and VM knowledge",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645481517

RubixKuber,"A rant: If you have no work experience, please don't soapbox about the ""realities"" of the industry.","There was a fairly popular post earlier raving about how without a degree, career progress in IT is impossible. The OP spoke with confidence and authority, stating that he's tired of being told by ""old timers"" that you don't need a degree to succeed in this field.

Another user went through his post history, and sure enough, a few months ago OP was asking about student loans. I don't know the full story, but as someone who is 31, started at the age of 25, and has a fruitful career in IT with no degree (I don't think I'd consider myself an ""old timer""), it rubs me the wrong way having university students with no work experience giving career advice with the confidence of a CISO. 

Are University degrees valuable? Yes, undoubtedly. Are they a requirement? Generally, no, especially in non-CS fields of IT.

The worst part is that there are constantly senior engineers and senior management (managers, directors, sometimes even C-suites) in these threads saying ""hold on, that's not quite true"", who's input is largely ignored because it doesn't fit the confirmation bias of whoever is feeling frustrated trying to get their foot in the door that day.

firelink_kink,I think job hopping has ruined my resume. Should I take older jobs off it to help fix this?,"I've been a job hopper my whole career. The reason for this is imo, I started off making a really low level salary since I was clueless, new to IT, and didn't go to an elite school. It took me a while to slowly get better paying offers at better companies, only getting to 6 figures this past year. I get along with people and I'm an average to above average performer. 

For example, my decision to move on from my 4th job was because after a year with the company I was given a high performance review (most people get 3s, I got a 4), got called in to our VPs office to be awarded a special promotion, which was a 3% raise, and was expected to be pumped and grateful for that. My other co-workers didn't get a raise and were actually jealous that I did. 

If I had stayed at any of my prior companies, I wouldn't have gotten promoted to the level I'm at now salary wise. I know this because I have friends at all of these places, and none of them make as much as I do.

So anyone my thought is maybe I should be truncating my resume experience. If I only include my last  3 or 4 jobs, I look like a reasonable job hopper. The prior ones make it look worse. But i'd be cutting my experience down to 3-4 years instead of 6-7. This might make it harder to get hired, especially since I'm in my 30s, so I would come off as maybe under experienced for my age.  I also might be considering a liar if they find out I have older roles.

2 Years in Helpdesk
1 Year as Linux Sysadmin
1 Year as Presales Solutions Architect

Certifications
Security Plus
Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator

Skills:
Linux Administration
AWS Cloud
Automation and Orchestration
Endpoint Security Hardening

Interests: Linux Solutions Architecture!

I love what I get to do, which is mostly helping my sales team develop a game plan to build a solution for a potential customer, and then helping that new customer implement the plan. It’s kinda my dream goal. Kinda. But the product I sell is mostly geared towards a windows environment. I think long term I want to get another certification in Linux, likely the RHCE, but I want to hold off till end of next year for that. I actually love my employer, so I do plan on staying with them for the next two or three years before moving on. My role does let me stay relatively sharp on my Linux skills, so I’m not actively hurting my Linux career goals by staying in this role. It’s just about a 65/35 split windows to Linux management, and I want 20/80 or 10/90 split windows to Linux. 

In the mean time, I’m trying to decide what my next certs should be. My goal is to do 1 - 2 certs per year.

My biggest known technical weakness is Networking. I know the basics, like what a port is, what a firewall does, dns, tcp/udp, DHCP, and the like. But I don’t know how to set up a DHCP server, have no idea how to build a vlan or ACL, and I only just learned about this thing called MPLS. 

I don’t really want to be a Networking engineer or expert, but I want to be at least somewhat useful. I’m not sold on Network Plus, as I think it may be mostly review (please tell me if that’s wrong), and I’m not sold on CCNA, as it may be beyond what I need. 

If not networking, my other thought is to get my AWS Solutions Architect, but I don’t know how respected that cert is by the industry.

allbusi,"Architects, Consultants, and similar roles -- How do you avoid doing customer support?","I have been looking into different roles such as Solution Architecture and tech consulting.  Many times these roles develop relationships with accounts and customers.  Normally, the role is about understanding customer requirements and turning that into a well-thought out efficient and sustainable architecture to meet those requirements.  

In talking with several architects I know, I understood that customers and accounts can ask for 'help' with more support related items (think break/fix) or need 'help' with training in a sense.  An example would be the customer would not be up to speed on the tech and asking the architect/consultant for almost personalized training which doesn't lead to much progress.  

With that said, how do you avoid an architect role becoming more and more support when you get asks like this from customers?  Where do you draw the line between what you will do and won't do for customers within your role and how to gently communicate that?  The challenge is that these roles are there to help the customer so you have to be careful saying no in an indirect, but if you overcommit to too much support related work then you're also not doing your job any longer.

NPCwars,Is it normal for QA to be such a hassle in large corporations?,"I'm in the IT department at my company and do tiers 1-2 helpdesk as well as QA testing for tier 3 tickets/enhancements.

* However, I would say 80% of the time I can't even do the test because I need to create a ticket to someone else in IT to fix an issue. For example, to send out basic ""orders"" to test, some process is usually stuck. That ""process"" is completely different from the tier 3/enhancement because it's a basic function of the application. 
* Other times it's because the UAT database is completely different from the production database so every little detail has to be modified to properly test (since its two applications and the third party software test and live environments are synced). I've brought up my concerns and delays to this but to no avail.

     I am new to considering IT as a career path. I always assumed that it was a career field that required a degree.

xzzzv,"My mentor is leaving, giving me full responsibility - Bad time to quit my job?","I'm   possibly in an awkward position right now. I'm working as DevOps/CI/CD   engineer for a big company where this is my first job after  university.  There is another person that we hired recently to help out  50% and doing  50% on software development and he got into the role  quite quickly I  would say, so that's good!

I  have  worked six months currently and my mentor decided to quit the  company.  He had full responsibility on DevOps/CI/CD and now I'm in a  position  where I'm in charge of it all basically. And that is not a  easy task for  a person to take over.

Fine  I  have no problem having that responsibilities, but I applied for a  job  recently since I was a little dissatisfied with the salary overall.   However they liked me so much they want to hire me basically (they   almost wanted to say that on the interview :) ) only if I send in the   code test which I am very sure I will pass, its not so hard, its just   standard procedure. I also have a connection there at that company that   vouches for me and that weigh heavily.

So   now thoughts come in my mind that maybe I could have a strong case to   bump up my salary here since I get new responsibilities. And I would   like to hear your opinions about it. I like the company and I'm afraid   to do something that could damage my reputation if I would leave now   directly after my mentor have left the company.

Prophet_60091_,I have a dream job and I hate it. Need a slap in the face/sanity check...,"I'm unhappy.

I feel like I have no right to be unhappy, but I am. I can't help it and I feel like I need to be slapped across the face and told to stop being a whiny little bitch about how wonderful I have it. 

I have it really good with my current networking job, way better than I feel I deserve, and yet I hate it. 

I am paid just shy of 6 figures in an area where the average is a little more than half that. I work 100% from home and almost nothing is required of me. Many days I do literally nothing at my job. I take my dog for long walks in the forest, I go grocery shopping whenever I need, and I have plenty of time to watch youtube videos and work on my own little side projects. 

I very rarely have to actually \*do\* anything for my job. My direct manager is in another part of the world and thankfully his day ends when mine begins, so I am in a goldilocks zone of being left alone. 

It's amazing, and yet I'm very unhappy about it. 

My manager's manager is a bit of a micro-managing fuckboi. When he joins video calls, it's often in a wife-beater t-shirt or some other shirt that's way too tight on him. He's the kind of guy who will promise some unrealistic deadline to executive management and then demand that you deliver on his promises. He has zero respect for the engineers he manages, constantly builds silos and tries to filter all inter-team communication through himself, and is generally toxic. The C level that manages him is also a bit of a fuck-head bean counter who says shit like ""I traveled to the office in X country and just loved it! I loved being in the office and can't wait until we all are back in the office together! I also didn't get covid while traveling and so it must not be that bad as everyone says!"" My direct manager is a bit aspergery and not the most emotionally intelligent, and also a bit of a sycophant towards fuckboi manager.   


All of the above managerial train-wreck happens outside my timezone, so again, I'm mostly shielded from it, but I see the affect it has on my coworkers. My team is a small international team. We're 3rd level escalation. We're not junior engineers or NOC. Instead, we are supposed to solve the issues NOC and Network support can't solve, and yet we're treated as a projects/maintenance team. I often wake up to see the private slack chat for my coworkers (management is NOT in that channel) and it's like looking at a crater where a bomb went off. I see them talking about some bullshit management is saying to them during a meeting, but I don't actually ever see the meeting because it's not in my timezone. This kills my morale. 

My team also has an insane turnover rate because of this. Within my first 2 years at the company, we lost 4 people on a team of 7! One of those was our direct manager who stood up for us against fuckboi micromanager and was terminated for it. (Fuckboi manager was angry that micromanager needed time off when his father died from covid)   


The entire team has gone to HR, even up to the C-level head of HR. We have gone through all the proper channels to file complaints about the toxic working environment and HR told us to fuck off. Seriously. If we don't like it, we can leave, and so many of us have left.  


All this against the backdrop of what is otherwise a dream job - being paid a good amount of money to do practically nothing and not be directly bothered. 

And yet I'm really upset in my current role. 

I'm not being challenged. I've stopped studying after hours to improve my skills. I'm stagnating. 

I know that's all on me. I know I need to use this golden opportunity to use the time and improve myself further, but it's fucking hard. It's hard when I don't have a clear goal to strive for. 

There's supposedly a light at the end of the tunnel - another manager is creating a new team and has tapped me to be on it. I'll get out of the current management structure, will get more than 6 figures, will continue to work remote, will be working for a technical manager I actually respect, and doing some interesting work. It feels like my salvation, but this manager has taken MONTHS to even write a description for the position. Meanwhile HR can't move forward with it until he does. He has no idea how important it is to me to leave my current team, and I don't know how to tell him without it coming across as a threat to leave the company. I've been in limbo with the possibility of moving to his team for ages now and it's really starting to get to me. To make matters worse, my current team is now losing 3 more people out of the 7, all at the same time! (Positions were backfilled after the original 4 left, and now 3 more, including 2 of the backfills are fed up and leaving this month). My transition to the new team might be delayed even further by management's inability to keep people on the team.

And so I'm unhappy, and yet I still don't feel like I have a right to be. Sure, my current management is toxic and I'm not being challenged with anything, but for fuck sake, I'm being paid very well to do nothing and I'm mostly left alone by said toxic managers. 

I'm being unreasonable, yes? I need to shut the fuck up and appreciate how good I have it, yes? There are plenty of other people out there working tech jobs, making half of what I make, busting their asses in much worse situations and I have no right to complain.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645442674

I do but some people that I tell this to seem to think I’m shooting myself in the foot. 

For the long story I’m transitioning internally to a more senior spot (already at a mid/senior level) so threw my resume out to check out what else is out there. Recruiters spamming me quite a bit and I’ve applied to a number of companies. 

I’d certainly take a better offer if I found one or if it helped me pivot into something I found interesting or a different industry/sector I’d like to work in. I’d say I have a above average resume as I have lots of degrees, lots of certs, lots of experience and I’ve kept current with technology. 

I’ve had several interviews and got an up front picture on salary ranges, benefits, etc and on more then a couple I’ve gave a flat no after the second/third interview when pay, benefits and etc have come up. 

Notable ones were:

Pay way too low, I told them I’m not taking a 25% pay cut to work there and they were quite shocked

Another the benefits cost ~800 per pay period and I sorta scoffed and said that’s employee covered right? Pay also was barely over what I make now so after they gave me a spiel about how great everything was I told them no. 

Another only had 8 days off per year which they then said but you also get holidays off. Told them no unless they were flexible on it and got the “it’s company policy line”. 

As for recruiters I just tell them my rates and expectations which usually shuts them down real fast unless it’s actually a decent job. I have had a few come back and counter ridiculously low ranges which I just reply No to. 

Do others do this? Am I actually burning bridges like some seem to think I am. I feel there is no reason not to tell my actual reasons for saying no. I’m up front that I already have a job and all that so not misleading anyone.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645398832

Blep-Hello,Having a bit of Certification Analysis Paralysis -,"Hi folks! Long time lurker (on another account, this is throwaway) so thanks for the wealth of info as always.

I’m reaching out to get some thoughts on a certification path. Been working in the Unified Comms/AV area for a little bit and as a result have interfaced with a lot of different IT infrastructure. This has required me to work with AD, Azure, TCP/IP, VLANs, voip endpoints, 365, and so on. Typical network and cloud stuff generally.

I really love the intersection of these topics, and am hoping to develop my career in this direction (Networking, Cloud, Systems Admin) but am having a bit of analysis paralysis about what certifications could (1) help me continue to build knowledge and (2) give an edge in the job market. I don’t have any IT certs at the moment.

I’ve looked at A+, Net+, CCNA, Google IT, MS certs (Azure, 365, etc) but feel that I’m just bopping between them and need to focus on 1 at a time. I definitely value the knowledge primarily (got a bit frustrated with the CompTIA “this is how to take the test” mentality) but recognize the value of a credential to prove skills and get jobs.

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645393234

I got an offer out of no where in cyber security with the gov and I’m only 24, I didn’t have this in my career goal until closer to 30-35 as I assumed I wouldn’t be able to pass the interview without more experience so now here I am the pinnacle of IT(excluding the mentioned leadership roles) at 24 years old salaried at more money than I can even count(failed college algebra 3 times for reference) I have effectively won the champions league, premiere league, and World Cup as a rookie. 


I’m trying to figure out what my next career goal should be after I’ve rose the ranks of my current position. I have genuinely no idea what to work towards next besides just advancing my new position then becoming a leader. I don’t know which would be more obtainable or if there’s a step in between as I didn’t plan to research this for many more years. 


The ceo of a company I did an internship at during college went help desk &gt; system admin &gt; cyber &gt; project manager &gt; CIO &gt; VP of IT &gt; pres of it &gt; President of the company &gt; CEO. 



He did this starting in the 90s so I don’t know if the process would look the same in the 20’s with so many more IT roles than 30 years ago. 


It may a Silly thing to be concerned about as I have many years until then but I can’t stand not having something to work towards so in a way this is like an extension of university to prepare myself to “graduate” from the employee grade to corpo grade. if there’s any feedback I can get on how to better prepare myself to make the move later on then I am all ears!

Jell212,value of a Cover Letter - Especially important when changing careers,"Hiring manager here. Spending my offday reviewing job applications.
Realizing for perhaps the first time the value of a Cover letter.
I thought these were sort of old school things. My company doesn't require them with applications, but about half the applications I'm reviewing have them.

It really is a valuable tool to put the hiring manager in your desired mindset before they review (skim) your resume.
Especially for candidates that are applying to an entry level position without any real IT experience. In this instances its CRITICAL to include a cover letter. Otherwise I'm just skimming the resume for relevance and finding little or none. Reject button comes next.

Advice: If seeking to get into an IT job, and you don't have IT experience - that's fine. But include a well written cover letter. Explain why you want to get into IT, and what your experience would offer. This primes the reader for whats to follow.

 Currently I'm completing my bachelor's in cyber security but part time while I work full time so at my current rate it would be finished in 4 years, my dilemma is that is it worth continuing?

I have a plan for self studying/projects and certs...but as for my next job, I'm not sure what I should go for.

I've had [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/65vb8s/advice_if_you_are_wanting_to_go_into_devops/) in mind (among others) while thinking about getting to where I want to be.

I'm currently working on learning more about networking to get a decent foundation, and there's a decent job that seems aimed at my level for a Network Admin (really more Jr. Net Admin but that's the title). I have some contacts at the company as well. I do have some concern that this wouldn't really lead into the DevOps kind of path though. I don't think I really want to go into networking for real?

I would aim for a Jr. Sys Admin kind of position, but that would generally mean no Linux in sight since basically all positions I see postings for are for managing Windows.

The other option I've been considering is trying to find a Linux Support position to hopefully be able to move into a Linux Admin position later.

fintechmen,Changing career to Consulting or department manager,"

Good evening everyone,

 I'm another one posting a career change here, but it's perhaps the place where I can feel comfortable getting diverse opinions.

I'm 30 years old and I work in an IT company in Lisbon with about 50 employees, I give remote support to our customers and prepare new material that we sell, basically I do the necessary installations before my colleagues go to the customers to install the equipment, I also do the equipment repairs and diagnostics.  I have had this role for 6 years.

The boss of the company always saw that I could be an asset and gave me the opportunity to change my position, two options came up.  Basically, I ended up organizing the departures of my colleagues, dealing with the purchase of material, I became the section manager, then I stopped being the technician and started having the responsibility of managing the area.  On the other hand, he offered me a position in IT Consulting, he would invest in my training and start by giving a little support and later start implementing solutions that we sell to clients.

This will dictate my future, the path I choose will be my nearest future.  I like both scenarios.  I have always liked management and I also adapt to Consulting.  In terms of work, Consulting will be heavier in the change because it is something I am not used to and I will have a long way to go.  I also think a little about salary, the prospects would be to earn a bit much in Consulting.

It's a difficult decision and I've thought about it several times.  What would you do?  Any opinions?

NIT1100011,Interviewing question for hiring managers - should I tell them about an intellectual learning disability?,"OK, so I have several decades of IT related work under my belt. I am currently interviewing, and as I'm coming across applications that I'm filling out, there is the question of if you want to disclose any disability. Back in high school, I was diagnosed with learning disabilities.  Testing at the time showed that I read 1/2-1/3 slower than average. On the application, should I disclose that yes, I do indeed have a disability?  The applications are not specific; it's just a general question that incompeses all disabilities such as intellectual, physical, or medical.

The places that I have been applying to incentives you based on certifications. I have a few from the early IT days (A+, Security+, MCSE...),but nothing recent.  This is because I usually run out of time before I can finish the certification exam. For the Microsoft certification, I was able to provide documentation of the disability and get the testing time extended, then pass the exam.  I was not able to do this same accommodation with VMware and failed two attempts because of time.  The second test's score improved over the first attempt but still not enough to pass when 12 questions are left unattempted.

Before signing the offer letter, should I disclose this? Should I negotiate the terms of the offer to compensate for this disability stating that unless the exams are able to be altered, I will not likely pass them?  Should I change terms to something showing hours of study, lab work, proof of knowledge in other ways?  Or will any/all of this cause more harm than good and potentially pull the offer off the table?

LegendofThomas,Stick with MSP role or take role with University Comp Sci department,"I'm been working at an MSP for a couple of months as a level 2, it's fine money and benefits are decent enough but a bit boring overall. Most of the issues are either outlook, printers, or general Windows issues, nothing really overly exciting. I'm guessing I'll have to keep nose to the grindstone for a few months or a year or so before getting to work on more interesting stuff. This is my 2nd time in my career being in a level 2 role but following my previous level 2 role several years ago I went into a Team Lead role. I work a hybrid model, 2/3 days in office and same at home, I was offered fully remote when hired but they went back on that, I stupidly didn't get it written into my contract. The office is quite far away, around an hour an a half to two hours train journey each way. I don't really feel any major bond with any of the team, most of our communications are through Teams message, I've only met two of them in person. It can be tough getting help sometimes but I've managed fine by figuring out issues myself and the odd time getting help.

I was just offered a job as a tech officer in the University I attended years ago, which happens to be about a 30 second walk from my apartment. What they've told me about the role is I'd be managing their Mac lab and an upcoming refresh, managing patching and backups for Linux servers, some network/firewall management, and after that it really could be anything, there's so much that goes on in the University and final year students work on such different projects that I could end up getting involved in anything. They told me they don't mind that I don't know everything and don't expect me to know everything, they liked me cause I seemed to have the drive to learn since I was doing certs etc outside of work.

The University jobs is public sector so comes with all the benefits of that. Salary is fairly similar for both roles. I'm a bit worried about getting a reputation for job hoping as if I leave this MSP role it would be my second short time with a company in a row. 
The only other catch is the University role is cover for a career break and will last about six months, however when I went into the University the other day to meet my potential new boss he said he doesn't expect the person I'm replacing to come back, and expects a permanent role to open although it will be an open role and I will have to apply again, but he stressed he couldn't guarantee anything.

Part of me thinks this is one of those opportunities that only comes along every so often and I have to be ready to take a risk and this has been echoed by people I've asked for advice.

ExploreResponsibly,Starting my first remote IT job next week - any advice?,"I’m in the midst of a career change, coming from years of various outdoor education jobs. Think Outward Bound, NOLS expedition type work. Needless to say it’s a big change.

Currently enrolled at WGU in the Software Development program. New job is customer support for a large software company. No real professional IT experience, just a PC gamer who’s tinkered with computers for most my life. My interview went well — I was a program manager at my previous job so lots of transferable skills and I’m a charismatic and personable guy. 

Anyway, I’m curious what it’s like working remote since all my jobs have been in person and in the field guiding trips. 

What is networking like? How do you make new relationships outside your immediate team? Is it harder to move up the ladder as opposed to in person jobs? 

Any general advice on WFH?

My goal is to become a software dev in the next 2 years, so this is a foot-in-the-door type job for me but I’m worried I’ll have a hard time moving up without those in person networking opportunities.

Cecil4029,3rd Interview: Practical/Performance Windows Server DC Advice,"Hey all,

I've been in a Help Desk role for a few years now, regular tickets included some resetting of passwords on Server 2012/2016, Google Workspace, 365 licenses and accounts, etc.

I have my assessment for a Support Tech Tier 2/Tier 3 job on Monday. I've passed my 1st and 2nd interview including the technical assessment part. I've been told the last hurdle will be a remote session where I need to set up a Domain Controller, GP/AD and attach a workstation to it. 

I may be overthinking this, but has anyone had a similar skills assessment? Will they give me a list of requirements including IP schema? Will the DC need DHCP setup on it? I've been studying all day with my Server 2016 and Win 10 VM's in my home lab. I'm just getting a bit nervous and hope I'm not getting too deep into something.

ChumtheWaters,Recommendations for progression for IT Service/Support Manager?,"I'm burnt out in my current position. The company is failing to meet demands and expectations and having poor financial performance, and I can't help but feel like I'm going down with the ship. It's no surprise that there has been a massive turnover in the last year. With no bonus announced and likely no raise, I'm looking for a change.

What I do: After 3 years in a Support Engineer role, I moved up and currently manage a 24/7 service desk. We are not a typical tiered service desk and are expected to be a jack of all trades.

We monitor, maintain, and support over 50 large-scale projects/customers with both on-premise and cloud identity management systems. The amount of technical debt that is handed off with each project is unbelievable.

I'm not unfamiliar with 60 hour work weeks and am constantly woken up to system-wide issues as I am the primary escalation path. This is exhausting, and why I'm trying to step away for something different.

My technical skills: Releasing backend software updates, basic Linux troubleshooting, basic VMware/VDI Horizon usage and management, SQL querying, basic networking, backup and replication. I've also done system implementations for some of our smaller-scale applications (site survey, hardware acquisition, racking and stacking, complex software installation/configuration, creating documentation, supporting and maintaining customer relationships.)

I'm highly technical, but all of these skills are entry-level. I have no certifications. I have a 90% complete bachelor's in Business with Management Information systems emphasis. I progressed to this position through hard work and proprietary knowledge.

Where I believe I shine is my customer communication and relationship building as well as management and organization. I work closely with the customer to manage expectations and provide a high level of technical support. I am an advocate and voice for them internally. I was thinking I could move towards a role that showcases that skill set.

At first, I was looking into Customer Success/Experience Management, but it seems the salary is typically not in the range I'm looking for. Last year I made 94k before taxes. I'm looking to make the jump to &gt;100k.

What are some other recommendations for potential roles that I can apply for? I would love to manage a team, but not sure where I would fit.

I really want something with a strong work-life balance. I can't deal with the stress of late night outages anymore. It's taken a toll of my mental wellbeing.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645329196
TheTimelyTuna,Any advice for a cable guy needing quick entry to IT?,"Hello all, 

I really need some genuine advice as I feel lost on my career goals.


I’ve been a Cable Technician at a large communications provider for 2 years now, and to put it nicely I do not like the job (so much that I’ve actually made a promise to leave by end of March to my family). Well, “hate” the job is more truthful. Originally I wanted to go and work with my hands, but going up telephone poles and digging for lines in the rain gets old after a while. So I’ve been on Indeed almost every day looking for stuff, seeing if anything catches my eye, and IT seems to be interesting, specifically cyber security.

Now to give background I have done only 1 year of college, resulting in a Homeland Security certificate, and I am a Tech level 3 at my job, although I know that doesn’t relate much to the IT field. I’m pretty good with diagnosing Wifi and internet problems in residential situations (very broad, I know), but I do not have any IT specific certifications or schooling. Before this I was in retail management for about 3 years, and before that I was a phone salesman for a few months. I’m the person that can usually help fix family members phones and laptops, and I do find interest in learning about computers and their parts (not IT but just giving background).

I know I could get a $15 entry level job with no experience, but I currently make $20+ an hour, and with OT about 50k a year (TONS of OT). I wanted to see if there are any steps you all would recommend in my situation for a fast track into the IT field with a $20+ hourly range.

For reference, this is Southeast US pay, if that helps.

I understand I am leaving my job in less than 2 months, but it is getting very difficult to go into work daily without feeling overworked and stressed. I know chances of me getting work at my range would need some skill set, so I can accept not having a job for a few months to a year (I have saved up money for bills and also have a detailing business I do for family and friends on the side). I just enrolled in Coursera to give the Google IT cert a try, though I know it’s not a guarantee into the industry.

Maybe I should ask instead:If you were me, what would you do in my situation? I just feel lost overall and need help, so any advice or input Is appreciated.

Thank you again.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645327026
Incredible380,"Mid 30's, no degrees, no certifications, Desktop support tech level 2, where to go from here?","So I've had a bit of a late start to my career in IT. I've been working full time since I was 19 years old, I just never went to college. It's not that I'm against it, it just never happened. I was working full time and making decent entry level income and had family I needed to take care of at the time and it just never lifted off the ground. 

I'll admit, I tend to get complacent a lot. I spent a lot of my 20's working at call centers doing customer service type roles. I guess I'm pretty resilient and can take a lot of crap, so I stayed there. However I did land a pretty nice level 2 advanced tech support role in the wireless industry so that did help shape my technical skills, combined with the fact that I've grown up building, configuring, and troubleshooting computers and electronics. 

Enter my 30's and I left my tech support call center job for a level 1 help desk role. It was mostly fielding call and e-mails for various issues, but I connected with a lot of experienced people there and learned a lot, the place was a mixed bag of very experienced individuals that were overqualified but also people that were barely competent. I was only getting paid about 36k a year at the time so I knew I had to try to find something better. I worked at this company for 5 years. 

Fast forward to 2021, I landed a desktop support technician role at a smaller company and they started me out at 50k. They didn't even care that I had no degree or certs. During the whole last year I did extremely well, so this year I moved into a senior role and they bumped my pay to 65k a year to also align with some other techs on the team since I was being a little underpaid compared to them. This has obviously been a huge boost to me, as I've pretty much doubled my pay in a little over a year and financially I'm quite comfortable now. But it begs the question where to go from here, I know I have the potential, I guess I just never completely applied myself when I was younger. 

I like my job a lot. I get to work from home 90% of the time, the work load is not too bad, I have plenty of projects and get to learn a lot of new things, my manager and co-workers are great to work with. I don't have to do overtime or be on call. I like this gig, but what should I aim for next? I think eventually I would love to earn 6 figures. I never thought in my life I would, but I'm just trying to see where I could branch out to.

Scared_Tea_6513,"Never had a job at 28, no education, want to start in IT/tech/coding"," 

Hello,

I've never had a job at 26, can't work until I'm at least 28 because I'm going through heavy medical treatment for at least a year from now, so I'll be 28 when I'm done. Struggling with a disability ever since 17 that prevented me from doing anything in life. Dropped out of college after being successful for the 2 first years despite my condition but after that my condition became too bad and failed 3 years in a row. Was studying to become an engineer.

I've spent the 12 last years of my life doing nothing but struggling with a condition.

I know someone at 28 who never had work experience is unemployable nowadays especially since I'd need to start over at 28, I'd wish to get education but it looks like it's too late? I have nothing good going for me, no skills. 2 years of failed engineering school behind me and high school diploma.

I'd like to have a decent job in the future but that seems impossible. A big issue is that I probably will stay too disabled to do physically hard work. I'd need to go paper/desk jobs because my physical condition won't be able to sustain heavy physical job. I would look for a restaurant jobs doing the dishes or so but that doesn't seem possible with my disability. After that, I'd want to progress to get a decent paying job.

I was thinking about learning programming in the year of medical treatment I have coming since I'm going slightly better now but that looks like it's too late. I've heard it was impossible to land a first job in computer science without experience in any work when you're 30-35 which would be the best case scenario for me.

I'd have wished to get a job I could be proud of after getting a degree in college but in my country all colleges are rejecting me because of my failures but I really couldn't succeed because of the condition I have and I can't clear my academic record.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645305772

I added time stamps in each video for you convenience if your only looking for something specific in a module or only want to refresh on a certain topic so please feel free to make use of them.

There will be 20 videos for this course, the first is just the 4min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules with the actual course.

The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+ and the other courses I deliver should also be enough to pass the exams associated if there is a exam associated to that specific course.

If you have a question about a specific topic in a module or the course in general that you would like more clarity on, please feel free to ask and I will try to assist you where I can if I'm online.

4604Spartan117,Helpdesk to Jr. Cloud Engineer in 15 months - a hopefully helpful post,"Hey everyone - I wanted to give back to the sub a little bit at least by sharing my tips and tricks from my journey in IT thus far. I started in IT from something completely unrelated in October 2020, accepting a Level 1 helpdesk job for a somewhat large company.

I've posted before (actually posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/rn9xos/1_year_in_it_an_update_for_others_to_learn_from/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) last month which seemed helpful). I started in IT by getting my CompTIA A+ cert, then progressing over time by additionally grabbing Network+, Microsoft Azure, 365 Fundamentals, Modern Desktop Admin, Azure Admin, and most recently, Security+.

Recently, I was finally promoted off of helpdesk to a brand-new L3 internal position created for me, Jr. Cloud Engineer, with a focus on Microsoft Azure, 365, and Automation. Feel free to read over my last post I linked above for the details, but basically, my company which has historically been majorly on-premise, started projects to utilize Microsoft Azure services last year. Around the time this project was starting, I had recently attained my Azure Admin (AZ-104) cert. I talked to the VP/Director over the project since there were no admins or otherwise that were familiar with Azure, and told them I could do it. Looking back now, the fact that they agreed is insane. At that point, I had been in IT on helpdesk for about 8 months.

I wanted to share a few of my tips and tricks here so that you can hopefully find the success you want in your career.  


1. Find something you enjoy doing and become ""the guy (or girl)"" for that thing. For instance, for me, learning PowerShell and Azure were the biggest keys to my success. Both of these things were things that no one else at the company had basically any real knowledge about, thus thrusting me into the spotlight because I could provide solutions that no one else could.
2. Make connections with everyone. Arguably the only reason I was promoted so quickly was because of #1, but also because of the real connections I made with people I worked with. Whether it was my coworkers, managers, directors, VPs, even Executive levels, essentially everyone in corporate knew me and liked me overall. The old saying ""it's not what you know, it's who you know"" rings true, but its even better if you can both know people and technology.
3. Never stop learning. Don't burn yourself out, but don't flounder and be lazy. You can't expect the world to fall in your lap. I essentially haven't stopped learning *something* since I started in IT. Technology is always evolving. Get that certification, get that promotion.

I don't want this to go super long, so I hope this helps you. Feel free to ask questions if you want, I want to help out however I can. Otherwise - thanks for reading!",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645272714
Stock-Advice5082,IT Manager - No Pay Raise in 2 Years? Is it Time to Move On?,"Hi IT Redditors!

Just wanted to post this to get some advice and just vent a little.

I work as an IT manager at a company for 4 years and they haven't given any raises in the past 2 years that I've worked there. Initially they said it was due to COVID but it doesn’t seem like that is the situation.

In my performance reviews, I've exceeded all my goals yet when I asked for more compensation due to performance I've been denied due to the company ""Not having sufficient funds"" and that ""my salary is on the top end of the salary average"" (I make $95k/yearly in WA state). The irony is the owner just bought a 1.5 million dollar yatch, yet cannot afford a wage increase. Also, I am the only IT person in my department, meaning if I leave, there would be no one to take my place and in my position I'm required to wear many hats (aka work lots of hours). 

I'm having one of those ""Work hard, so your boss can buy one more lambo next year"" moments, except it's a yatch instead and it's definitely giving me a bitter attitude toward my job. 

While I do enjoy the job and some of the people, the company favors family and friends over regular employees. Most of the employees are given the short end of the stick unless they are part of the friends/family program. This has made many employees in the company disgruntled, like myself. My gut is telling me to move on from the company as it is a dead end and that they don't value hard working employees.

The breadth of knowledge and problem solving we have to do is astounding, as imo it’s the same degree of difficulty as software dev. Everyday it’s Linux scripting, SQL queries, and at least 3 meetings a day.

Looking for a position that pays at least 65k and is just laid back. I worked helpdesk as a student worker in college and really enjoyed it as I just chilled on the job all day. I have a degree in electrical engineering and have work experience in software dev.

I’m sorry if this sounds lazy. But my reasons on slowing things down is that I have depression so it makes it extremely draining to always be working that much at that level. Don’t want to to stick with amazon as every branch of IT, (cloud support, FC IT, etc. )are all overwhelmed with work here. Same goes for software dev jobs there. I really think just having a slow easygoing job is best for my personal mental health.

Please name jobs with actual titles that I can look for. Idc what I do as long as it’s easygoing. Learning is not an issue either, I’m confident I can pick up experience and learn whatever i need to make any job happen.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645258173
mekmasoafro,Should I work while getting a degree or should I put all of my time on my studies?,"For background: I'm a freshman Information Systems student in the Philippines. I study in a not so reputable university (honestly, it's viewed as a meh uni). However, I can teach myself well enough to compensate for the school's lack of guidance. My parents work in Dubai (their salary isn't that big but fairly good for Filipino standards). 

The thing is, they offered me to work there while getting my degree in a Philippine-accredited distance learning college there. That degree is AB in Information Technology. However, that program seems like shady to me.

I weighed to pros and cons and for easy comparison, this is what I'll get:

If I continue studying here in the PH:
-They pay for my uni.
-More time improving my skills.
-mediocre uni reputation
-no companies to do internships (like seriously)
-I'll still go to Dubai after my graduation and look for entry level jobs there.


If I go to Dubai
-I'll study in a flexible distance learning degree (still Filipino College, only based in Dubai).
-I can start working right away. (My parents have some connections but not in IT though)
-More job opportunities (entry level salary there equals to entry-mid salary here in PH honestly)
-I think there are more internships there. 


*Also, I think I would get certifications if my decision is finalized.

votebleach2020,"Back gain for more resume help. My resume is being viewed, but not selected","So, in my first post, I got a lot of great advice. To recap, I downplayed my old caregiver job, fluffed up my current nursing home administrator job and added a few more roles relating specifically to IT work. I worked on my intro a bit, added on more reference and shrunk the entire thing down to about a page and 4 lines (the references unfortunately spilled over to the second page, but everything else managed to fit on the first one). Someone suggested I remove the certs I have yet to obtain and instead talk about the certs I'm currently working on in the top portion rather than filling half the page with a bunch of certs I haven't gotten yet, so I listened.

Judging by the notifications I saw from Indeed and Linkedin, I've applied to maybe 50+ job listings and maybe a third of them actually looked at my application, which is not bad. I'm not complaining. I landed my first interview on February 1st. It was kind of a soft interview and the company's IT admin praised my knowledge. Mentioning task manager and rewording the comptia 7 step troubleshooting method in my own way grabbed his attention when he presented me with a help desk scenario. He at first thought all I knew was theory, but I informed him that I did have hands on work using virtual machines and packet tracer, even if I haven't worked in a real world IT environment, aside from the basic networking I do as part of my nursing administrator job. So it looks like I left a solid impression but he ended the interview saying he has a stack of resumes to go through and he'll get back to me.

One company responded to my application and asked me a series of questions, which I have attached in the link below, but no call back.

So, that was the second revision of my resume, I edited it one more time earlier this week because I just passed the Network+ and so I added it to the list of certs, and deleted the part about me studying for it from the intro. I haven't yet used the latest version to apply to jobs, but it's not that much different than the one before. 

So based on the long story, what about my resume is turning off potential employers?

This is my second year as a student. Ive been able to finish up fast by coming in with lots of credits from HS and doin 20 creds / semester. 

I feel very confident in networking and IT and i am debating like as i think it would look strange to graduate in 2.5 years as i only have 20 left without internships or what not for CS as CS seems very competitive. I also know lots of people in the CS program who are much better programmers than me. I figure to take a gap year or reduce down credits and become part time, meanwhile working at a NOC position? In the year i can also brush up on cs a little more like learn new stuff thats not taught in school. 

Whats your opinion? finish up in 2.5 years total or take a break and work a year as a NOC and take like 1 or 2 class a semester stalling it to nearly 4 years, but it will only cost reduce amount, i will not incur full tuition cost but only like 400$/credit which is the standard rate.

Additionally, i think one of my parents may not think its a good idea and suggest minoring in math which i dont want to do as thats extra work like calc3,4,diff eq, which i am too tired to deal with.

Opinions??? I know the CS field pays much more than IT, idk. I dont really like leetcode, but i assume idk...

2. Accept a Service Desk Analyst role (60k AUD) and have no degree. I'll have to work my way up in this company, and I don't think that'll be easy.

So as you can see from my history, I haven't had a super varied history. The technology changes, but it's been service desk, or supervising a service desk.

Right now I'm doing WGU cybersecurity. I'm also doing the Odin project, learning Python, and doing THM of course.  Once I'm through THM I'll focus on SEIM.

tl;dr and the question:  
All that said, I've been reading that jobs in cybersecurity/devsecops/etc are incredibly hard to break into, contrary to the claims of everyone selling cybersecurity educational material.

And now my main question - what should I work on to become one of these. I want to mention that I'm more into playing with data and creating some models that fulfills certain goals more than trying to make it as efficient, scalable and available as possible.

For now I am web software developer with 2.5 years of experience. In work I use .NET, SQL and javascript (mainly, I don't want to elaborate more about my techstack as it's irrelevant according to ML). I have master's degree from CS and for my master's thesis I developed ML project which maximalized profit from football (soccer) sport bets. It contained full course of ML project actions so I did:

* Data gathering from unprepared source (I mean it wasn't from kaggle or anything like that)
* Data aggregation to form of data sets
* Building neural network models along with hyperparameter tuning
* Conducting some research about received results

Techstack used in this project: python, pandas, numpy, keras, keras-tuner, peewee

I had finished this project in september last year and did some minor fixes/improvements since then as I am looking forward to try it in real life. Anyway since I came up with idea of changing my specialization from web to data science I also learned some additional algorithms:

* Decision trees, random forest and AdaBoost
* SVM

My roadmap for now is:

1. Learning some statistics math
2. Learning more useful algorithms (Naive Bayes, KNN, K-Means and PCA)
3. Few smaller projects using kaggle datasets
4. One bigger project by my own

Is that a good approach to the problem? What would you recommend to learn from field of statistics and algorithms?

TL;DR I am web developer and want to switch to ML/DS. I already know python with libraries used in this field like pandas and numpy. I also know few ML algorithms like neural networks, random forest, ADABoost and SVM. What else should I learn to get a job as MLE/DS?",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645217129

I’ve been doing this for a while now and I thought maybe I could get some insight in how to approach my career. I’ve been doing “system administration for a little while. I put quotation marks because even though it’s my title (and I know I shouldn’t focus on titles because they mean Jack in our industry.) I’m getting to my wits end. 

When I broke off the help desk, I became a System Engineer at a company. I went in excited because I could finally learn and apply what I had learned in my homelab in a live production environment… until I started the job and was stuck supporting proprietary programs and building knowledge that wasn’t transferable outside of said company. I got exposure to Citrix VMWare solutions but it was surface level. I can create gold masters for templates, set up ESXi hosts, allocate more resources and all that jazz but I know that’s not enough. 

Any tasks that required bigger changes like setting up a cluster had dedicated teams that did that work. It took me a long time to leave that role because I didn’t have enough experience. I finally got out and became a System Administrator at another org. Once again I got hyped! now I could work on Windows systems and build up transferable knowledge ex. Server builds, O365 migrations, etc you know shit that employers typically expect someone that’s a sys admin to do.

That’s not the case either, I was brought in to basically create new users and groups in AD and do ticket work their higher tier admins don’t want to do while **they** work on big ticket projects like migrating infra to Azure etc. I’ve taken on more responsibility here. I’ve shown I’m more than capable of doing projects and spearheaded tasks that nobody wants to do. 

There’s plenty I can learn at my current org like Office 365 etc but the SME’s that handle them will not let me shadow them, do knowledge transfers, or let me take on lower level incidents. I’ve brought this up to my leadership but they don’t care and don’t really go to bat for me.

I’ve been interviewing around and I’m repeatedly being told I don’t have enough experience. Every place I’ve worked, it’s been under teams that do the higher level work.  I’m being too honest in admitting that in my interviews, but if I lie and things get super technical; I set myself up for failure. The other day I was asked if I’d ever set up a Windows Sever failover cluster and I said “no, but it’s something I can learn.” Of course, I was declined the role. What the Hell am I supposed to do and how do I move up if I can’t get into an org that lets me do just that? 

If there’s anybody that can provide feedback or maybe help me do a mock interview with me I’d really appreciate it.


Thank you.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645211164

I technically never really have to go into the office, but here is a unsaid thing that we can get asked at anytime. Some coworkers go in often. I also dont know their plans ""post covid"" or when health advisors say it would be safe to bring more people back into the office.   


Im just not sure if my wfh situation is permanent. Being able to keep the job would greatly ease a move, but there is no guarantee that after I move I wont find another job in time and they would suspect that.   


so I might get treated as expandable. It really would change my thought process on the move, but Im concerned about asking.   


I probably see myself there till the end of the year, but asking this question could come across as almost a notice of leaving.

badoopaloo,"Difficult communications at my first IT job, am I being too anxious?","Hey there everyone. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this kind of post, but I wanted to put my experiences out there and see what you all thought. Do I stick around and hope it gets better, do I jump ship and try to find something else?

I recently started a new job (my first job in IT, less than 1 year there) and since then I've been mostly remote. I'm still not even sure what exactly I am supposed to be doing every day. I've had many days in the past few months where nobody reaches out to me -- no check-ins, assignments, report requests, training videos, etc. 

I find this confusing because my boss and coworkers seem perpetually busy, despite the fact that I have been nothing but open to taking on more tasks. Trying to reach out to them is quite difficult--they'll ignore my initial questions (usually via Teams or Discord) and schedule meetings with me to talk about it and then **never follow up**, not even a ""Sorry, I double booked"" or ""Can we reschedule?"" I'm simply left guessing whether they have forgotten that I exist.

When I do receive a task--and it makes me giddy at this point--it's usually so open-ended that I have to ask many follow-up questions: When is this expected? Should I report back to you or someone else when I'm finished? WHY am I doing this? I run into the same issue from above where I will ask those questions and get a quick response to meet up and chat about it... but the chat never happens! A task that would take me a few hours suddenly takes all week because I'm chasing everyone around to get information.

Is this a common thing? Are my coworkers simply just too overworked to even fill me in? Am I not reaching out enough? I'm a bit anxious and pestering them multiple times per day feels awful, but it seems like that is what it takes to get them to pay attention to me. I've never had a working experience like this--usually it is the other way around where I am so swamped by things to do. I don't mind just sitting around on my computer all day--YouTube is great, but I am actually BEGGING for more meetings at this point. They don't even have to be meetings, just shoot me a message with the answer! I want to be doing things and getting experience!",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645205891

I've been with the company for over 2 years now and have been performing really well so far. But lately I'm feeling truly unmotivated and don't feel like doing any work. On top of that, it's been extremely slow workload wise which is allowing me to slack even more.  


This was kind of a perfect job for me, the company and the people in my team are extremely flexible. There is no micromanagement whatsoever and my manager is a genuinely kind human being which is making me feel more guilty.

I currently have a Tier1 ""Desktop Support"" position. I make 60k, awesome benefits. The downsides are: 

3hr round trip commute each day

I am not integrating well with the team at all. 

I have chronic health conditions that require sleep, so that commute cuts into my ""me time"" and family time.

22k for a six month contract, no benefits.

39k for a 12 month contract, expensive benefits (400 per month for a high deductible plan), with the possibility of being hired on, at which point the benefits would be better than what I currently have.

Both are basically helpdesk work, and both are located in my home city. Both would require me to sell my car in order to make the cut in pay possible. Which I can live with I guess, as I really only bought it for this job.  

 

Systems admin jobs aren't that common in my city.

**• Perform daily tests and health checks on key environments and systems, with recordings all logged**

**• Provide direct email, ticket and telephone support to customers reporting incidents, raising change requests or other queries, following ITIL protocols**

**• Carry out routine patching and updating of group and customer systems (applying fixes, patches, firmware and driver updates in accordance with the companies change control process**

**• Create and maintain existing customer and environment documentation**

**• Reviewing and optimising the monitoring configurations to ensure adequate coverage and minimal “false positives”**

These are the desired skills/experience of the job:

**Exchange and Office 365 (general administration)**

**• VPN and RDP**

**• Active Directory (general administration)**

**• Windows Server 2012, 2016 and upwards (manage disk space, performance, failed logins)**

**• Backup Software (e.g. veeame)**

**• VMware (ability to install &amp; configure virtual environments, including performance optimization)**

**• Firewall Administration (configuring and updating rules)**

**• SAN Management (basic understanding of SAN technologies and ability to configure and present disk sets to the sever farm)**

**• Microsoft MCSA/MCSE certified**

**• VMware VCP certified**

**• Cisco CCNA certified**

**• PowerShell Scripting**

**• Linux Server Architecture**

I've asked the recruiter what type of interview it is, and I'm told I'll be asked process driven questions, and her reply was essentially:

* **The technical test is usually a series of around 15 questions, they are process driven questions – they will be looking for you to explain the way in which you would resolve the issue.**
* **We suggest that you have maybe 5 examples of where you’ve used a variety of different processes in your real-life, this helps to really show that you understand the question.**
* **To get a feel of what questions they may ask – refer to the skills/knowledge noted on the job description.**
* **It is key to note, that they are not expecting you to know all the answers, this is just a guide for them to be able to give you the relevant training, if you were to join them.**
* **If you don’t know the answer to a question, it is ok for you to say something like ‘I don’t know the answer to the question, but I am more than willing to learn this process’.**

Do you guys have any advice? I reeaaally hate these type of questions, because I can Google common behavioural/competency questions and end up being asked none of them.

Fabulous-Stay-9546,Requesting advice on the following certification choices,"Hi there,

After landing my first Service Desk job (UK) the company is offering to pay (for two only) of the following certifications, however i would like some more experienced eyes to go over them, and give some feedback.

*  MS-100 exam: Microsoft 365 Identity and Services 
*  MS-101 exam: Microsoft 365 Mobility and Security 
*  AZ-104 exam: Microsoft Azure Administrator  
*  MS-203: Microsoft 365 Messaging      
* MD-101 exam: Managing Modern Desktops
* CCNA
*  AWS Sysops 
* Red Hat Certified System Administrator 
* Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator 

I will be sitting the AZ-900 in the future, therefore i think the AZ-104 would be a good logical choice to follow. I also see around reddit and job boards etc that the CCNA is a good cert, however it is not really an entry level certificate? (maybe someone could bring clarity to this)

I have also used Linux as my daily driver for a few years, so i am comfortable in that environment and have a solid understanding of the OS in a daily driver sense of the word, however not in a work / enterprise environment.

So basically the company will pay for the AZ-900 + any of the two from the options above.

I was thinking AZ-900--&gt;AZ104 + CCNA / Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator.

annontheseal,Trouble transitioning from Desktop Support to IT Compliance,"Bit of background: Got out of college end of 2019 and landed first IT helpdesk job for $28 an hour (Company 1). About a month or two later I get another job as a helpdesk technician for $30, but covid hit and it became fully remote (Company 2). A few months went buy and they wanted me into the office, so I started looking again but I did stay with the company for about a year and a half. After sending out a ton of resumes and doing +40 interviews I landed a fully remote gig at a helpdesk call center for a fortune 10 company and gave my two weeks notice (Company 3). Issue was the company lied about pay and I left there 3 months after for a salaried job paying 75k a year that is fully remote (Company 4). I basically do desktop support with apple computers, but a lot of my job is mainly working with MDM systems, resetting passwords, and imaging laptops as well as doing onboardings. My boss is super cool and it is a great team.

My issue: Currently I am in a super HCOL area and recently was handed a mortgage. Relocating is not really an option at the moment. However, at the same time I have kinda become the head of a lot of compliance work at my company. Compliance though pays very differently than desktop support, so I started looking into other jobs that might pay more and I keep running into a series of issues. First of which is the job hopping. I have a great explanation and am able to explain it away quiet easily if they hear me out, and most dont see it as an issue after I tell them a story. The second issue though is the lack of experience. While I work in compliance and know the buzzwords, the section of compliance I work in is rather limited. And during interviews I can generally get past the recruiter, but the hiring managers just back out the second they ask about my coding skills (no idea why they need this for compliance) or other skills such as security networking. 

I had an interview the other day go as follows: Meet with the hiring manager, he asks about coding for security and I upfront say I am not familiar with that sort of coding (not even going to try to fake that). Then he says he likes me a lot and has a great opportunity for me in a different section of compliance. I then go and interview for that since he got me the in, and the recruiter for the role say that they dont want to do any training and they think I would be a better fit for this other role. Guess what the other role is? Desktop support... and my resume does not even list I do desktop support, it just has compliance related tasks in it.  

The other big issue is the security gig I interviewed for also only payed slightly more than what I am making now and system admin jobs remotely in my area also pay around what I am making now. 

My main question is what should I be doing differently here? I interview well and get along great with people, but also the quick jumps in my resume I feel are effecting me. At the same time though I do need some sort of upward cash gain since I am in a HCOL area. Desktop support is ok, but I can stand end users and a lot of my job is me pretending to do things since I automated a lot of it. 

Any advice would be appreciated. 

Side note: I do have AD, Windows, Mac, MDM, and all the helpdesk shit down. Even telecom. Every job I have had doing helpdesk for a lot of people is an 8 hour job but I turn it into like a 3 hour one. At the callcenter I was at the manager forgot I worked there since I was so low maintenance. I was being trained to be a project manager at one point and a jr system admin at another.

Experience always trumps education in my mind, so that should be the first section, but again with formatting I'm not sure as to whether it's better to have a Skills section with bullet points on what I know, or just dive right into where I've worked in the past and have a short description of what I did there and the skills I used?

I don't want to get into it too much, but essentially our numbers aren't looking good and they continue to decline. They were already declining somewhat pre-pandemic, but they absolutely spiraled after COVID hit. The work areas are eerily mostly empty and people are getting furloughed left and right, including the guy who interviewed me and eventual manager, who got furloughed 2 weeks after I started. On top of that, employees are consistently leaving for better offers. I had one coworker who requested a $15,000 raise, but was only offered $5,000, and I suspect this is the case elsewhere.

They are trying to rebound, but so far it isn't looking good.

GamesMusicWeed,Interviewing for a job that pays 40% more at barely under a year at my current gig. Thoughts?,"Hi all, 

I really appreciate this subreddit and have gathered some really useful advice here. 

I left my ""Senior Help Desk"" position a little under a year ago to take on an ""IT Coordinator"" role at not for profit. I'm a pretty growth minded person at heart and just couldn't see myself staying in Help Desk at the MSP for years on end. I also caught the company owners lying to me more than once regarding my compensation and I just never got over it. 

I am now basically a solo IT person who manages an external MSP. I have a ton of freedom and the ability to learn + take on projects, which is one of the reasons I took a paycut to come and work here. My pay is pretty meh but at least I'm not expected to worry about on call. I hardly work after hours, but when I do it's because I've *chosen* to. I also feel that I've grown a lot in the short time that I've been here. 

While I do report to our CFO, she's extremely handsoff and borderline disinterested in IT. This is good and bad in my opinion. I hate being micromanaged, but at the same time I really do wish I had more support around here - even if it's just emotional. 

Anyway, I should get to the point. An acquaintance of mine (who would be my boss) approached me with an offer to interview for an IT Operations Manager position at his not for profit that pays 40% more, plus allows hybrid working (with allowance), whereas my current gig is trying to force everyone back to the office full time. Reading through the job description - it does seem pretty similar to what I'm doing, just as part of a small team, with more resources, more developed IT infrastructure, and probably more pressure (though I don't know how much). In the meantime I've also been approached by a recruiter looking to fill a similar ""solo IT guy"" role at for profit for 50% more salary. 

I know that money isn't everything, but I've always been bad about devaluing myself and these recent developments have rattled me. I don't want to be leaving that much money on the table, but I also feel bad about thinking about leaving so soon, plus there's the usual anxiety about jumping into the unknown. 

I'd love to hear advice from everyone! In the meantime, I'll keep prepping for job interviews :)",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645137213
znoth,"Networking certifications after highschool, should I get it before starting to work or after getting experience/while I'm working","Sorry if there are any errors, not my first language.

In a few months I'll be (hopefully) graduating from an IT highschool and because of this I started thinking about the future, specifically about networking.

I don't want to go to college because I dont think I could take 3-5 other years in school, so I started digging deeper in certifications and looking at jobs near me and basically all entry level roles don't have any must have requirements (other than a diploma) but some specified that it's better to have experience.

My question is: Should I get ccna and then looking for a job or apply, get experience, then get certified and go on with my career?

Personally I'd like to get ccna first because I want to learn networking more in detail than I did in school and so that I will know what I'm doing once I start working and not get that impostor syndrome feel. Plus having a certification on my resume would make me more likely to get employed(?).

forever_never_more,Imposter Syndrome --- Anybody else feel like this?,"I recently got my yearly review.  I didn't think it would be bad, but I also didn't think it would necessarily be glowing. It was.  My boss basically said I'm one of the rock stars of the team and there are only a few people in the entire org he would say that about. And he says all of upper management in tech agrees. 

Honestly, I'm scratching my head a bit. I view myself as a solid, reliable contributor to the SysOps team but don't feel my skills or knowledge are up to par with high performers in the industry. The widgets likely aren't going down on my watch, but I'm not exactly building new innovative widgets, or even trying to for that matter. There are sometimes entire days where I jump online and barely do anything I view as moving the organization forward. Furthermore, I don't even interact with my boss all that often. I'm pretty much fully remote and he and most of the org are in another state. It's hard for me to even envision how he or anybody could determine I'm a rock star performer based on such a limited view into what I'm doing.

This feeds a bit into other imposter feelings I have. Like I have always been a supporting role in every company I've been at. 15 years or so now in IT and I've never really had to architect much. I come in and maintain whatever exists or others build, for the most part.  I'm not even sure I could entirely architect a data center stack like the ones I work in if I had to. At least not confidently in a production environment. But after this long in the field, it feels like I should be able to do something like that.

I want to be grateful for the positive review but not sure it's warranted. And honestly makes me question if management at the company has any clue what any of its employees are actually doing.  I do tend be overly critical of myself, so maybe that is playing in a bit. I'm also pretty affable compared to the average tech worker I've worked with over the years so maybe just plain likeability plays in. I don't know, something feels off though. Either I'm clueless or the company is. haha",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645136020

I’ve been working as PO for \~6 years on and off in ports, shipping and ecommerce and another 5 years in management/operations roles.

Not technical background but I speak the language, do basic things in python and sql

I’m interested in Cyber Security because:

\- Only IT field which I’m certain will have growth in the next 20 years

\- I’ve been a generalist all my life, after 11 years I want to specialize but not stagnate and keep being marketable

\- It’s interesting, I guess depending on what you are looking for, but there’s so much to study and experiment

Besides your opinion, I lay out the questions in my mind:

\- With no technical background, can I make it?

\- With no technical background, will I be taken seriously? Are soft skills appreciated?

SuccessfulHurry8248,Should i leave company i've just joined for a higher paying alternative.,"**Background**

So I joined firm x 6 months ago, after they poached me from another company (market is hot). One of the main reasons I joined firm x is they offered a pay increase, and the promise that eventually I can learn, and develop DevOps skills.

**Developer into DevOps Engineer**

I’m now a developer at company x, and haven’t touched DevOps or anything infrastructure related since getting here. They’ve recently (5 days ago )tried to get some of us started in DevOps up skilling. The problem is they want me to continue working as a developer while the DevOps training will take up 25% of my time until we have more DevOps work (early next year). I’d honestly rather be 100% DevOps asap.

**Day to day realities are getting stressful**

Another con about company x is, it’s micromanagement. Filling in timesheets at this place is so complicated and almost intrusive. 20 minutes with client blah, 15 minutes in meeting y, etc. Not to mention work has been very dry recently so, timesheet anxiety is a real thing(do I really say I did nothing all day). Security features on our laptops makes our jobs so much harder, and repetitive, we need approvals for everything!

**Alternative**

As I mentioned earlier the market in the country I’m in is hot. I have multiple applications going through the pipeline. One particular company has me going for the final interview with their ‘cloud Architect’. I feel confident that I will actually get the job (not trying to be cocky). The job this interview is for is DevOps engineer. They will skill me up, and 100% of my time will be working on devops/ cloud operations immediately which is what I want to do.

 Not to mention there will be a significant pay increase of the bat, and the company in question is one of the cloud giants in this field. I reckon this name on my CV would be a game changer. Above I also mentioned the working culture. The company I’m applying for is already looking promising, saying I can be remote indefinitely if I like, even can go work in a different country so long as there isn’t radical time differences.

**$**

The final point is money. I’m not gonna lie cash matters to me. A friend of mine explained how securing pay increases early on ensures, I have negotiating room further into my career. in my books this means not being scared to look elsewhere, for competitive pay.

f0r_y0u_,"Looking for direction, would appreciate any advice.","Hey All,

Just want to say thank you to everybody offering advice on this subreddit. It has been instrumental to my career so far. This is my background:

In middle/high school I was really interested in CS; spent a lot of my free time coding and trying to learn about different OS's. Out of high school I went to an IT school for 9 months, finished school in july, got my A+ in August. Applied to tons of jobs, ended up getting a response from an agency, and I had a contract within a week.

My first contract was placing phones on desks, was a lot of manual labor, really wanted to get involved with more technical work, the contract was around 1 month long ($22/hr). In October I was doing an assignment traveling to different retail stores in the region and reimaging registers, verifying devices were online, etc. I hated traveling for work, never want to do that again (Paid slightly better, $25/hr).

The third contract I worked is where things changed; I was first hired to just do desk setups, but they had ran out of monitors due to supply chain issues, and I was able to maneuver my way from the project team to the Deskside support team. I got this job through the same agency and it paid $24/hr.

After a while of being on the Deskside team my role was officially changed from project team to L2 Desktop tech. At first I was super happy about this; But after discussing with some coworkers I realized I was being massively underpaid for my area. The reason being, that I had got the job through an agency. After talking with the agency and the company I was hired directly by the company and now make $35/hr.

As for my immediate next steps, I plan on staying at this job for the foreseeable future. But as for a 5 year plan- I'm kinda lost. I am interested in Cybersecurity, but there seems to be so much controversy on what certs are actually useful. Also, I have on idea what type of cybersec role I want to have. and after doing some research my current plan is:

\- Stay at this job

\- Get my Security+ cert

Lyralei13,What would be my best route towards Network Engineering career path? I'm in need of advice from experienced ones (Please see more below),"Hey guys. I really need some advice. Just a brief background about me. I'm 24 and I've been a Software Engineer in a MNC Consulting firm. I left 2 years into the job right after getting promoted last December 2020. I took a year off to evaluate what I want to do as SE isn't really for me. I know I did great in those 2 years, hence I got the promotion. Now, I've come to the realization that I want to pursue my university-found passion with computer networks (or hopefully to become a Cybersecurity professional someday.)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kind of lost right now on where to begin after a year of break. I haven't really done anything career-oriented within that 1 year of break other than recovering from severe burn out and some mental health problems since the pandemic took a toll on it. I really need some advice on what would be my first few steps towards my goal. Right now, I contacted my close friend (who's also my former university professor on computer networks) and got myself NetAcad seat tokens so that I can self-study and refresh my knowledge with CCNAv7 fundamental topics (Introduction to Networks; Switching, Routing, and Wireless Essentials;  and Enterprise Networking, Security, and Automation). 

Also, this may sound off but I feel anxious on what would my potential employers and interviewers think about my year of break. If you can share your experiences or something similar to mine, I'd really appreciate if you do share them so I can have some idea on how to tackle this low point in my life.

VVitchCult,Should I stick it out with MSP or pursue a K12 position ?,"I've been with an MSP as a Remote L1 agent for about 5 months now - it was my first job out of college. It's not a bad job - it's completely remote, but the pay isn't anything to write home about (18.50). I'd applied to the k12 job late last year, and had a short phone interview during one my breaks. The call went well (or so I thought), and the interviewer told me they'd be reaching back out sometime after new years. I didn't take ""after new years"" to mean mid-February, but the interviewer has since reached out via email asking me if I was still interested in the position (tbh - I don't think he remembers the initial interview judging from the tone of the email).

Honestly - the pay for the K12 position is a dollar lower (17.50), but ever since I've taken this job, I've been counting the days until I have the necessary experience and certs to leave, and I'm sure the K12 position will be less stressful, and give me a better work/life balance. But I'm also not sure if I should jump to a position that pays lower, and there is also the unknown of what the work environment is like there - will I learn valuable tech, or just be the guy who sets up Chromebooks ?

throwawayjobhunter84,current network technician approached about new desktop role - worried about stagnation,"Hello, 

I am currently a network technician making ~$25-30/hour. My job is extremely basic, essentially I go to sites and act as hands and eyes for ""network engineers."" The vast majority of these network engineers are utterly incompetent, unable to do even the most basic show commands without prompting. My ability to actually manage/fix routers and switches is extremely limited due to security/access. For some reason we aren't trusted with credentials for the devices we're supposed to be fixing. I haven't learned any new networking on the job in over two years. 

I'm also on call 24/7, have been working between 50 and 55 hours per week lately, and I'm still falling behind in my work due to staffing issues and travel time between sites. 

I recently got my CCNA through self-study toward the end of last year and have been looking for a new job since December. I'm wanting a junior engineer role or something like that, but I haven't been able to find anything. I think my lack of real world experience is holding me back. It's pretty tough being in an interview and only being able to tell them about VLAN mismatches, incorrectly configured IP addresses, and recovering routers/switches from ROMMON when they ask what kind of networking I do. 

I'm also terrible at job hunting. Every new position I've gotten since my start as a PC refresh tech ~8 years ago has been through reputation and having recruiters basically cold call me and offer me jobs. I feel like if I could get into a NOC and grind out a year I feel like it would really boost my career to the next level, but I'm not seeing those positions around me.

I've been approached about a new position managing a few hundred desktops which are essentially used as kiosks. My understanding of this new role is that it would primarily be break/fix on these devices. I've done desktop support in the past, and I'm confident that this will be a very easy gig, but I'm worried that I will continue to stagnate. These kiosks are running windows 7 and will need to be updated or replaced. I've been told that whenever that happens my position will still exist, but I didn't think to ask what, if any, role I would have in designing and rolling out that change. I've also been told that there will be opportunities to work in networking in this new role, but it won't be Cisco and it won't be anything complex. 

Should I even consider this position at all, and, if so, what pay should I expect? I live in a small city in the middle of the east coast. 

The pros, as I see them, are:

* No more after-hours. I've been told that this is strictly normal business hours Monday through Friday
* Pay raise. There's no chance I'm leaving my current job without a significant pay jump. The year is young, but I'm currently on track to make over 70k with overtime. I also get reimbursed for mileage at the federal rate, which greatly exceeds the actual cost of driving my car. 
* Possibility of learning new things. If I'm going to be involved in the planning and implementation of the replacement of these devices, that will be something that I've never done before. Also any new networking experience is better than what I'm getting now.
* Less stress. The job sounds pretty chill and I'm already cool with the manager.

The cons, as I see them are:

* Continued career stagnation, possibly even regression, which could damage long term career prospects.

What I noticed is that when you are on the home page the url for the bank sites is simple but once you click LOGIN the urls change they get way longer and some start with secure, auth, www1.
So does that mean when you try to login the website sends you to another (more secure) domain or does having more letters make it more secure/harder to find ??",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645068590

CoolComputerMan,3 years in the IT field. Struggling to pay bills. Need advice.,"Sorry for the wall of text:

&amp;#x200B;

Hi ya'll. I am 3+ years in the IT field and a junior in CompSci at a state university and in my mid 20's. I work for a third party IT vendor that does everything from printer repair to firewall configuration and installs to running cat6 drops to networking for small - medium local businesses in the south. Basically we do it all. I live in town that isn't high cost of living and I would classify myself as fairly knowledgeable in the IT field as I rarely ask the senior techs for help and I can work on client issues by myself (from email setup to firewall configuration). 

&amp;#x200B;

I make $16.50.

&amp;#x200B;

Granted, I have no certs (trying to study for Sec+) and almost everything I know I was taught on the job. My company hires people with no skills to build them up but pays them very low wages to start ($10 - $12). I pay for my university schooling out of pocket and have no student debt but just recently had to skip this last semester as I just can not pay for rent, all my bills and school. I am studying cyber security  if it matters and wish to jump to info sec after I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

This company is very relaxed and works around my school schedule and I am still able to work around 30-38hrs when I am in school as I am a part time student. I am the main tech for several clients including a large sized county commission building, the county sheriff office and its jail as well as several medium sized medical facilities like doctor offices and the like. When ever a ticket comes in I am the guy to fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I ask for a raise my boss tells me to get certs, which is 100% fair I get that, but those (A+, net+, sec+) only come with  a $1 raise. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just need some tough love and real advice from other people in the field on am I being dumb staying here? I  cant pay my bills on time, I cant go back to school without getting loans and the max I can make here will probably be around $22 if I graduate and get a few certs. Should I just get loans for school? Should I job hunt? Should I sell all my things and live in a van by the river?

joanofarclee,Declined network engineer offer for cyber security - turns out job description is WAY OFF.,"\*Thank you for taking your time reading this first of all! I am an ESL, so please bear with any grammatical errors...\*

&amp;#x200B;

Hello 

I am at about a month in with my new job. Initially I had 2 offers at hand. I am regretting about not taking the other job that I declined over my current job. They are around the same pay considering the commute. 

First, let me describe what the two offers were: 

1. Major ISP network engineer position - full remote, potential hybrid, 20m commute.  

The job definitely excited me. I enjoy networking a lot, and I have strong desire to learn more. I had a great vibe at the interview. At first, they turned down the offer because of my weak scripting skills. However, they actually created the position into two, because they liked my energy and other strengths a lot that they wanted to give me a chance.

I did not intend on becoming a ""network engineer"" forever. However, I think strong networking knowledge is critical in order for me to grow more in IT. I felt like this would be a great stepping stone for me to grow from an entry to a mid-level career. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. DOD subcontractor cyber security analyst - 45min commute

At first, this offer did not excite me as much as the other one. However, I also wanted to give a try at a dod position with higher pay and better work-life balance. I was burnt out from the support role I had then. The support role was fully remote, but never felt like I was getting any free time. I heard a lot of things about work-life balance with dod contractor positions. So I thought it would be nice, despite the 40min+ commute. I also heard scrary stories of irregular hours in networking field and the ISP's workload. 

Also, it seemed like that this job had a lot of moving parts where I can learn a lot along with cyber security aspect of it.

During my job search phase, I also learned that cyber security market is hot, but it is very hard to tackle into. I could not pass up the opportunity where it's typically open to 3 to 5+ yrs of experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I chose #2 over #1 for ""work-life balance"" and ""cyber=hot market=buzz word""

&amp;#x200B;

After job offers were given - 

I remember feeling that the scope of work that the hiring managers are explaining is somewhat different from the job description that I was given. Despite the uneasy feeling, the interview went well and I assumed it as because of ""classified"" information connotates with the DOD work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this uneasy feeling of mismatching description, I contacted the recruiter once again to verify with me if the job description really matches to the work I will be doing. The recruiter confirmed and assured me that it matches, and it will be mainly what the job description says.

On the first day of work, I still felt that something was different. I ended up asking and confirmed from the hiring manager that this position is a ""System Engineer"" role and there must have been discrepancies with the subcontracting company and the contracting company. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because the hiring manager also realized that I have more interest in IT and networking, they try to give me tasks related to networking. But overall, there still is a lot of engineering portion of work which involves a lot of electronics, software development, system eng', etc. Also, the technology is too outdated and dod-specific to the point that I am afraid that I will not be marketable after this experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone at work is great. The job has the work-life balance. The job is NOT the typical DOD work - everyone works very hard, no one is lazy, and my bosses do work very hard and want us to succeed. And there is plenty of stuffs to learn here. 

However, the work is still unfulfilling for me. It is too ""engineering"" for me, and it is very outdated and dod-specific technology. It will not be as exciting as current industry standard. Also, I will be gaining more ""engineering"" work than ""IT"". 

I also feel bitter about the recruiter. I feel like they scammed on me. Because of this feeling, my mindset is not at right place right now with this job.

My partner who also works in the IT tells me that I should continue working here and learn as much as I can. I appreciate the input, but we are both early in our career. I would like to hear more from people in the industry with the experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? Should I stay in this job and gain knowledge as much as I can? Do you think there still is something valuable for me to learn and apply in the industry after this job? Or should I contact the hiring manager from the declined offer and ask to see if the option still is available? (From the company website, it is)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DL 

I declined a network engineer role(remote) for a cyber security analyst(on-site, minimal hybrid) hoping for work-life balance and tackling the hot market with little experience. Turns out the job is less security and more engineering (electrical, software, system). Everything is good, except the main scope of work. Technology is outdate and dod specific, and I am afraid I will not be able to grow my career from this job. What should I do? 

Would this affect my career growth to stick with the current company?

Differences between a systems engineer with the dod contractor vs. a network engineer at major ISP?

Would experience in old tech hinder my career growth?",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645059641

watercoolingisalot,Looking to go back to school and get a Degree. Should I change my plans and get a computer science Degree?,"    I'm 24 years old, and I'm currently working as a Senior Support Specialist. (Level 2 support) I've got just shy of 7 years IT experience and I've gotten experience in all kinds of systems and pieces of IT but I don't really feel like I excel at anything beyond my very capable troubleshooting skills, customer service skills and my ability to adapt to new challanges/roles fairly easily. I've messed around with group policy a little bit, a bit of networking here and there, and some data management and analytics but I've never really dug deep into any of these things and I'm still not really sure what I like.
 
   Part of me thinks I should stick to what I'm good at which is people and and pursue a career in management. (I've always been placed in mentor type positions with level 1 techs and interns coming to me for guidance) The other part of me is really curious and wants to learn more and hopefully find something I can really sink my teeth into and get good at.

ITjobadviceburner,Should I Talk to My Manager or Update Resume (or maybe both)?,"I'll try to keep this brief. I took a new job that allowed me to move to a state that is closer to family. I have been at this job for about 4 months now. I went from a domain and exchange admin to a system admin (really just an application admin). I went from managing a domain and several servers/systems to managing a large application but no server management (IT manages those). I'm not a part of IT. I work for a specific department at this company so I am more like shadow IT (this was changed during the hiring process and I didn't really understand the implications when I accepted). I was told there would be Linux server management but that is not the case. This is important to me because I am working towards making the jump to Cloud Engineering and DevOps (working on a degree and certs) and I have no professional Linux experience which would really come in handy (though I do have some home lab experience, but not anything I can put on my resume). 

&amp;#x200B;

It has been an extremely slow transition into my new role despite me almost hounding my manager. I have no mentor since this role was changed and is new to this department (used to actually be part of IT). My manager leads a large team consisting of several sub departments and is often busy or distracted and forgets to follow up on items with me. I've had that happen in my career and I'm more than happy to remind or do what I can on my end to make that easier for them. I haven't had a chance to develop a relationship much with my manager and the things I hear from the rumor mill don't make them sound very approachable or reasonable. In a group setting my manager made the mention they don't like their people to move around the company until they have really gotten their worth out of them... So far working at the actual company has been pretty good at a macro level though (just minor complaints, like usual).

&amp;#x200B;

So this leads me to my question and seeking advice from someone who has maybe been in a similar position and what they did/how it turned out.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I voice my concerns to my manager and my desire to move to IT (assuming an appropriate position is available or will be soon) or should I just update my resume and start sending it out again and give notice when I have something lined up. I'm the sole income to my family and I can't afford to go without pay more than a couple months. Not saying I'd be let go on the spot  just for voicing this but I also don't have a ton of risk tolerance.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645051473

Zanadox,I interviewed for a new position this week and now I am looking for a bit of advice/conformation that I'm making the right choice.,"Currently working as tech support for a company, that I've been with for 4 years, 3 year spent in IT. When I first moved into IT, I was at a 38K salary. Since then I've gone up to 44k, which just started about a month ago. I don't have much of a specialty in my job, it's more reactionary than anything. The are days that it's very slow and I can fuck around on reddit. There are days where it's busy non stop. For the lost part it's flexible if I need to work at home, but it's not always an option. It's roughly a 40 min commute both ways. 

So, after my year end review of 2021, I found out the raise I was getting was only about 4.5 percent, so less than cost of living from inflation. Mind you this is coming after our boss told me he wanted me. To get at least 10% every year. After hearing about each month in 2021 being a batter month than before in terms of profit. I had brought it to my boss that I would like to be considered at least a hybrid position, 2 days remote, 3 days in office, and was basically told that would never happen because the higher ups are old fashioned. 

I decided to update my LinkedIn, just to see what my options were and with a week a recruiter reached out to me with a fully remote support job, for a much larger company in a similar field. It would be about a 20% yearly pay increase, but the biggest apprehension I have is that it's a contract job, only budgeted until the end of this year, with potential to be extended or turned into company hire. I would really only be focused it support for one area, and it sounded like I wouldn't have as much downtime.

Im torn on what to do if I get the offer. On the one hand, more money and totally remote. On the other, it's going to really turn the world upside down for my current job for a while if I leave, and I hate to be a person that causes conflict. It's also not guaranteed that I keep the job at the end of the year.

Has anyone been in a similar situation that can provide me with some advice? I dont have a degree, and I only has my a+.

I graduated college last summer and it took me a long time to find a job, I searched every day for months and finally landed one in december working for a law firm doing videoconferencing specialty stuff. I commuted 2 hours daily until i could afford my own place in the city to where I could easily drive 10 mins to work every day instead.

&amp;#x200B;

I work 40 hour work weeks but realistically I do about 8 hours of true ""work"" here weekly which is like an hour daily and for the rest of the time I'm in my office looking at my laptop that i brought. the guy that trained me who moved up within the firm told me there would be a lot of downtime to do whatever but I didn't think he meant THIS. working here genuinely makes me feel like i'm wasting my life. I went to school for IT to be hands on with tech and here I am clicking ""start"" on zoom meetings and holding my dick all day making a 40kish salary. one part of me says i'm blessed to be in this position, this office, and to make this money. the low amount of work means i can allocate for more activities in my life, but the other half of me says this is a waste of my time and a deadend job. what does zoom and plugging in laptops to expensive screens have anything to do with IT specialization?

MrSavvy,Corporate IT team members looked down upon? How to fix,"Hi all! I have a question for anyone else in the IT field who has worked in a corporate setting at an IT company.

I'm a full time sys admin at my company, I've been here for almost 4yrs. We've got around 1,500 or so employees. Internal IT ops is made up of 50 people, give or take. We support all systems any of our employees use. Internal IT ops almost never deals with clients/customers.


My issue: all of IT is ignored by the company when it comes to recognition, awards, bonuses, etc. For example: for the end of the year, my company picked 150 people to go on an all-expenses paid vacation out of the states and each vacation is +1. They only sent ONE person from IT though. I personally don't think I did enough this year to deserve a paid vacation, but I know of a dozen people in IT who easily do.


The point is.. this is just an example. It's like this with absolutely everything. Another: we've got 5-10 IT team members who have gone in to the office every day the past year during Covid. Everyone else is work from home in the company. But nobody acknowledges it. I don't even know if our CISO knows the dedication some of his IT members exhibit.

Fun_Aside_6081,Beginning in IT Questions. Want income sooner than later.,"Notable:

Hey! Was working in an operations specialist role for about a year and took an account manager position elsewhere to get more money.

Long story short, only worked at the account manager role for two months. Currently unemployed but I have around 6 months of savings. Did a mental reset and feel very serious about making a career out of IT.

The place I worked as an operations specialist wants to call me this afternoon. They want me back but the pay is shit. They’re looking for someone to add to their billing department. 

I want to begin studying for my certs. But I have rent to pay and don’t want to completely diminish my savings. I definitely want to begin working again so I just started applying around for Help Desk jobs.

Questions:

Should I return back to my old company and get my certs with full intentions of leaving when I can get a help desk job? - It feels wrong because I would be returning.

Should I stop applying for help desk jobs until I have my certs?

Is there any jobs that I can apply for before help desk that may make my resume look better? - All of the entry level postings ask for at least a year of experience which makes no sense to me.

When applications ask your desired pay range, how much is too much to ask for in help desk? - I’ve seen posting as low as $12/hr and others that are salaried at 40k in my area.

Jackdaw-4,Advice/Opinions: Network Engineer or Cloud Engineer (UK Based),"Hi guys

&amp;#x200B;

I am now nearly 3 years into a network engineer role and need to make a decision on which direction to move my career in next.

Any advice would be much appreciated. Have you worked in both, or either, and are now at a senior level? What have your experiences been? If I stay in networking, then where do I go next? Is it feasible for me to move to a cloud role with no knowledge of the cloud or coding? If going cloud then do I go AWS or Azure initially?

&amp;#x200B;

From my early research into cloud, my progression in both areas and rough salaries could be:

Networking = Network engineer (£30-60k) &gt; Network Architect (£60-90k)?

Cloud = Cloud engineer (£40-70k) &gt; Cloud architect (£80-130k)?

&amp;#x200B;

My thinking is that in my current role I enjoy the design and building of networking more than specialism areas such as security, which is why I have not included security or other specialisms above.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

I posted in a different topic a while back, just asking for general advice, and many people suggested moving to a cloud career to earn the higher salaries.

I have earned certs so far in A+, Network+, Security+ and CCNA and need to decide which route to go down next. My initial career plan was to go CCNP next, but after the advice I was given and researching cloud jobs, there does seem to be a lot more opportunities for cloud at the moment, and they generally have higher salaries than network engineers/architects.

Initially I didn't realise how heavily dependent on coding and software the cloud roles are. How does a network engineer start in a cloud role? I imagine I would need to start from the basics again, as my knowledge of cloud and coding is basic at best? From what I have read it seems to be a positive to have a background in networking to at least get me started. What job should I look for as a starter job and what path would I take afterwards? I still don't understand what a DevOps role truly is, as opposed to a cloud engineer or a cloud architect.

On the flip side if I stay in networking do I go for the CCNP and maybe CCIE, then look to move into an architect role?

I live hours away from any large cities in the UK and am very much not interested in commuting every day. Currently working from home most of the week and I definitely do not miss even the hour each way commute that I currently have. My thinking is that if I remain with regular networking then I will need to be on-site travelling to various cities in the UK to implement solutions, whereas with a cloud role I would more than likely be able to permanently work from home. This would have a big impact on my choice.

If I do decide to go cloud then I would definitely be looking to achieve foundational and associate level certs in AWS or Azure before even applying.

&amp;#x200B;

Verdict (TL:DR):

I think the key aspect of making the decision is how does a network engineer transition into a cloud role?

Raiden627,How do I get to the point of becoming a sys admin?,"I’ve been in IT Support for 10 years, working as a technician, specialist, desktop engineer, etc. I’ve worked in a lot of different industries but have been mainly focusing on biotech at this point.

I have some familiarity with switches, I can code in Python, PHP and Powershell. I’m pretty knowledgeable about Intune and Azure. I have some level of experience with Glacier and Veeam.

How do I get out of this rut? I hate working at MSPs and unfortunately there’s not many Junior sys admin roles available where I live. I’d even take a pay cut to get a Junior role because it’s easier to become a sys admin when you’ve done the job for a while.

lee_on_reddit,Looking to get into IT for specific reasons. Will it work out for me?,"Hello, I grew up using computers and playing games on my windows 95. I'm getting pretty old and have wandered around non-career jobs/schooling without ever getting to far in any of them.

I'm looking to get into IT for a few reasons. As someone who grew up using computers, I figured I would naturally adapt to it easier. I would note importantly though that despite using one all day, I'm not sure if I would be super excited about learning things about IT in great depth. I even took Computer Science in college and never finished it. I think I was more in love with being smart and having a good paying job as well as a respectable one, but maybe not be in love with the work it took to get there. Hopefully I'm not making the same mistake again with IT. I have taken my Comptia 1001 and passed and am currently working on my 1002, but I'm taking a little longer than I would like, though I am working part time, and oddly enough, it's probably more enjoyable to deal with than Computer Science in that I fact it is more immediately relatable to my day to day dealings with my computer I'm using right now. Some of the things I learned in 1001 like wiring standards for example was actually somewhat interesting, though I couldn't say it was my passion, but simply something that was enlightening.

That leads to my second point. I heard IT is a flexible career, allowing you to if not immediately, eventually work part time, remotely, or at a specific site. This flexibility is something I really would like since I'd like to keep my options as open as possible in a career. Why wouldn't I? It's something I'm going to spend much of my life dealing with.

Are there part time IT jobs out there for those who's been working in the career a long time and has decided to work 20-30 hours a week, while still making 50k+? This is something I'm highly considering because I really love my own time. That, and that fact that I've never found I was able to specialize my life too greatly at any one thing because I like so many things, and keeping my time open would allow my to explore what life has to offer totally, and not just what IT has to offer.

With that mindset, do you think I would struggle making it in the IT field? Would seeing it as just a job be okay? Do you really have to have that much passion in IT to make it? I'm not sure if I would want to spend a lot of my time learning new things over and over, but if it's just like having to learn something on the same difficulty as Comptia's 1001 and 1002 every few years, I don't think that would be very difficult.

I guess in a way, this has become a bit about career advice and support in general haha, but any assurance or details about how I would go about getting what I explained above and so on would be greatly appreciated.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645016610

ConcretePerson,Help with assesment of my current career situation and what could I do to improve it,"Hi Everyone,

Sorry for really long post.  
TL;DR - I have 2,5y exp as PLC programmer, moved to IT working for 2 years, but having just 6 months of SQL and 2 months of .NET acutal working experinence total. Due to covid and lack of IT jobs in the area I had to go back to PLC programming but I really want to go back to IT.

I have weird situation with my IT career and I dont really have anyone I could ask about my current situation and chances as well as how much and what I need to learn/train before I could try looking for an IT job again (mostly due to anxiety/embarrassment). I was hoping you could help me look at my situation and give me insight on how my situation really looks like and what could I do to improve it and go back to being a software developer.

I started by finishing industrial automation (master’s degree) and picking first job as PLC programmer. I was quite good at it and had \~2,5y experience in the field. After that time I was exhausted with constant field trips, clients demanding things they haven't paid for and grumpy boss and decided to give myself another go at IT (I always wanted to end up as software developer). After around 3 months of intense self-study I sent a resume to an IT company and kinda was rejected but hired. They said my C#/.NET skills are too low to be hired, but my experience in PLC field was desirable for some project for client working in automation field and they could train me in C#/.NET in the meantime.

TL;DR - 6 months of SQL, 6 months of training learning web development, then 3 months of Java-based course tailored to a certain software, 2 months of actual commercial experience, 2-3 months of internal projects, etc. summing for 2 years of my IT career.  
I had always great feedback about my motivation, productivity and working with the team (with only downside that I had low experience). I am 31 years old now.

In that IT job I was doing SQL queries on client software to create interesting data sets, production qualities etc. and having really good feedback from the client. I worked on that project for like 6 months. 

Then I was assigned to be trained with mentor to improve my .NET skills to get assigned to a project (all clients demanded at least mid-level developer). I ended up writing ASP.NET / Core apps with help of Plularsight, gained knowledge about making MVC apps with Razor, RESTful apis and hosting it on Azure. I also learned to use SOLID principles and trying to make clean code as well as working in agile. I learned a lot, but for my superiors (and clients) it still wasn't enough.

After half-year due to lack of projects I was reassigned to Java team working on modding certain software for client needs. I immediately knew this wasn't something I could work with, but due to fear of losing job I went on with it. After 3 months training and another 2-3 months of waiting for a project I finally landed with true C# project, working with Data API and working on authentication part (it was new api to interface with old client software, so I had to write new authentication that relied on old one for user/password/permissions management). It lasted 2 months, as in the meantime covid came about hard and client said they dont have money for that project right now and suspended it, and I was without project again. I tried doing internal projects and learning blazor/teams integration but my employer could not find my any projects and had to let me go.

That hit me hard from two sides. One that I was dumb enough to sit in that firm doing nothing, and because of that I can only show off 8 months of actual working experience (just 2 with .NET), and when I was packing my things due to rush and security issues I forgot to copy my learning projects, which were pretty good quality. I felt so bad about losing job that I could not move myself to recreate them. 

Second is that it ruined my self-esteem, that despite having great feedback, proper learning curve and motivation I just ended up not believing in my skill set (I tried to get another job in IT in area, as I couldn't move out of town at that time and nobody looked for junior developer and those who did turned me down).

Now I returned to my former employer in PLC field, and I am doing some side .NET project (connecting PC with PLC controller to exchange data in WPF, but it goes slow as its low priority). But it has been over a year since I was fired from that IT job.

I know I have a big problem with doing/starting projects due to fear of negative feedback and need for perfection, and I am working hard to beat it (as far as going on psychotherapy, as it is a problem that touches my life, not just my working career), because of it I had like a year gap in writing anything in C#/.NET, to the point that I am afraid of doing small commits in public GIT projects or making programs that just will work instead of being masterpieces outright. I constantly fear I will be turned down because I dont know everything or that my code despite being working and stable will be too messy or unprofessional (especially when I officially worked as dev) to even try getting a job.

Recently I got myself Packt subscribtion, and I was happy that I remember most things from tutorials, I know knowledge is inside me, but I am afraid I will fail because I will forget basics or my total lack of frond-end skills (I dont know javascript, css or php, I used only Razor pages and bootstrap for css, and at one job interview they asked me questions from front-end even when I informed them beforehand I had none).

My opinion is that because of being mostly on standby in my last work, and this one year gap and inability to continue my learning I practically erased all my progress, as I dont know how to present my working experinence, so I can show myself as competent and a good hire without resorting to making fairy tales or other outright lies that I dont want to use even when conscious that it could land me a job.

I know I have a good knowledge - PLC programming is quite low level and requires constant learning of software/hardware and intense problem solving oftentimes in crappy environment sitting in factory working and working against time. I have good C# basics and in Web Development but with total lack of front-end skills (I always found myself working best in backend), and just a little on desktop in WPF. My problem is I dont believe in myself that I can really prove it and fear that my career situation on resume is a red-flag that I am just some incompetent wannabe.

I know I should fight myself to push some commits in public git for actual experience and create a showcase of projects I made, but for the second part - I dont know if anyone will be interested in some CRUDs and I cant figure out what kind of project would be sufficient.

I would be grateful for any insight/judgement on where I really stand with my skills and career progress and what could I do to get back on track? How could I change my mindset to actually go back to IT?",ITCareerQuestions,1,1645004357

The consultant role seems super cool but I’m scared of losing my IT/Dev skills while doing it as I’ve heard it’s more business management than the trenches I’m used to. The pay is tiered and after one year I would go to $38 then $48 after 2 then it’s promotion to lead an account. It does seem like something I’d enjoy I’m just worried about flat lining. 



Tier 3 support with system admin responsibilities seems like a solid opportunity to grow and learn especially with it being for the government dealing with military stuff. It seems like a solid role to really become more well rounded after my 2 year IT absence not counting my 5 week help desk tier 1 role I just quit.



My main concern is I have a problem of quitting jobs within 1 year, I get isolated and overwhelmed then I walk away and I would really like to prevent that from happening again which is making me lean towards the consultant position so that I’m not isolated and alone despite loving the idea of the other 2. I would love to go back to being a mid-tier system admin again but having to learn a new language during a contract scares me, I’ve never been fired or let go and I feel like that’s something that could end up a reality there. In the tier 3 position it would definitely be laid back and pretty solo and just really basic level stuff excluding messing with things of war.

My goal is to work in tech. I know these positions are quite different, but I’m someone who values work life balance. I heard being in support is not easy to break out, which is nerve wracking as I still don’t know too much about IT related stuff like networks. I know consulting is long hours and require a lot of travel, but I heard the exit ops are great for big name companies. I feel like since I haven’t tried consulting work, I can’t really comment on those positions. If I go with the startup, I do eventually want to move to a company like google as a sys admin.

TimmyTye,Upcoming Comp Discussion meeting as a new employee,"Hi everyone,

First time posting here and looking for some advice. I read many posts in here regularly and want to ask for some help regarding my situation (fairly unique).

I make 41k a year as help desk but my company has a max pay of 65k for help desk employees (room to grow). I have my yearly compensation discussion today 2.16 and am wanting to make more obviously. I have 2 kids, 3rd on the way and am sole income of the household.

 Things get tricky because I have been with the company only 9 months, but have excelled so far by beating the training expectations by 6 months. This is also my first job in an I.T. role. To further complicate the matters, I don't have my B.S. which is now required for my position when it wasn't a requirement just last year. (I am graduating in July however). I want to ask for a minimum of $3,600 but ideally $7200 increase so I have an extra $300-600/mo. How should I approach this? I love the company and don't want to look elsewhere when I graduate, but will if it's in my best interest.

By this time next year I hope to have my B
S. in Cybersecurity completed and possibly my M.b.a. in Info Tech from WGU.

How should I approach my desires in the meeting without sounding too greedy/pushy? Would it be better to be reactive to what they are saying and present my concerns/desires based on their approach? Should I bring the matter back up upon obtaining further education/certifications?

Tldr: I've been with the company &lt;1yr in my first I.T. role and graduate soon. I want to make more as I make 41k when the range my role ends at is 65k. (I'm at the very bottom). Not sure how to ask for more or if I should.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1644989595

Comfortable_Drive793,"Stuck at the bottom, just a help desk monkey, don't really know what to do next.","My career so far... 

* 2008 - 2013 ($11.50 - 13.50/hr): Tier 1 at a call center doing tech support for a company that sold VoIP phones and cloud VoIP service - Technical, but not very - Have you tried factory resetting the phone? Upgrading the firmware? Do other phones exhibit this problem? Then transfer to Tier 2 if that doesn't fix. 

* 2013 - 2017 ($16.50 - 18.50/hr aka $36k/year) Tier 2 at a call center doing tech support for a company that sold VoIP phones and cloud VoIP service 

-- Network+

-- SIP School Certified

-- Wireshark Certified

-- An internal certification for QBRI ISDN H.323 video conference calls - There were actually some government/military customers still making ISDN video conference calls in 2013. 

* 2017 - 2019 ($40k/year): Worked as an installer for a company that deployed Avaya phones - Not really that technical. Work was mostly physically going out and racking the servers, putting phones on desks, etc... I would put the server in the rack, get my computer on the customer's Wi-Fi or tethering, and let the actual engineer setup everything. 

-- I had no desire to learn all of this Avaya specific shit because it all seems like it's on it's way out. 

* 2019 - Now ($55k/year): Help desk monkey at small large company (like 1000 employees). Basic shit - adding/removing new hires and leavers, unlocking accounts, assigning O365 licenses, ""My printer isn't working."", ""Can you put new toner into the printer."", ""Can you go make a list of accounts that haven't logged in over 30 days and verify with HR if they still work here, disabling the accounts that don't."", adding iPhones to Intune, managing our cellular account, I'm a remote office so I'm the virtual eyes and hands for our network guy, building new laptops and adding them to Intune, backing up decommissioned laptops to the NAS, etc... 

Thanks to COVID (no one coming into the office) and some big losses the company had recently... There is a good chance my office is going to close in the next six months. When my office closes I'm not sure there is going to be enough remote work to justify my job. 

So I'm looking at IT jobs... and it seems like I'm not really qualified to do anything other than another help desk monkey job. Just using the IT jobs at my company as an example... 

We have two network guys - I don't know enough to do their jobs. If we didn't have Meraki stuff I would be completely useless.

We have a security guy - I don't know enough to do his job. I don't really even know what he does. I think it's all compliance stuff. 

We have a bunch of people that handle our CRM and SAP - Don't know anything about that (other than how to reset passwords for our CRM). 

We have a developer that does all of our factory stuff - Don't know anything about dev other than making ""Hello World"" in Visual Basic back in high school in 2005. 

We have two guys that handle everything AD/O365/Azure related - Don't know enough to do their jobs. I have access to Azure AD, O365, Intune, etc... but just to do help desk stuff like resetting a user's MFA or giving them a Visio license. 

We have a guy that handles our website and does graphic design too - See don't know anything about dev above. 

## So I feel like I'm stuck. 

First of all I don't know what I want to do. I don't mind being a help desk guy, but I do mind being 33 years old and making $55k/year (I'm in NoVA around DC, so that's basically nothing). 

Second if I did know, I don't know how to transform that into a job. Like what should I do? Get my CCNA and then just apply for network admin jobs?

TryHackMe,Any advice on when to leave your first IT job? Especially when they like you...(very long post btw),"Hello all, 

(Too Long Dont Read is at the bottom for the short summary lol....)

So I'm in a dilemma, basically based off what the title says, I got my first IT Job, and out the gate actually getting paid fairly decently above the ""norm"" I guess you can say, well at least considering my age. (early 20's)  (This is also after I found out a few months later (now) I was lowballed on the offer)

&amp;#x200B;

But anyway, I feel this somewhat urge or need to leave... to some degree, but I also feel stuck and entitled to the company because of how they looked out for me. I mean it's a great job don't get me wrong, but the environment itself can be really toxic to some degree. Especially being new, it was like being in a boxing match. I'm sure this is normal as it is with any job...but overall I don't see any growth here...I spoke with another ""coworker"" I guess  you can say (we have similar backgrounds so it was easy to talk to him) and he said the same thing. (This is contract work btw..gov't contract) .. I didn't want to say that specifically because I'm not sure who may be on this subreddit, but at this point I don't exactly care.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like every time I even think about going to another Job, I think about everything the company has done for me, and how much effort they went through to get me here. I realize though I am indeed just a number no matter what, and they can replace me if they really wanted to at any moment which is possible, but it just feels like I'm so in debt to them no matter what. So I'd feel bad for leaving. But then there's another side of me that thinks about the stuff I have to put up with and especially when I first got here. Again, every job has their cons or moments and crap you have to deal with, but Idk I dont want to have that feeling of leaving and going to a new company and be like ""well dang I could have stayed with \*the company im at now\* If I knew this"" or something along those lines. If you know what I mean. I've read a post once saying he remembers leaving his previous job and moved onto the new one just be let go from that one! So I guess I'm just not really trying to have one of those. I mean it happens, and at some point probably will, but idk. I just feel stuck.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, it's a cool gig, cool job. Can't go into too much detail about it right now, because again never know whose on this sub but I'd hate to regret my decision of leaving if the next is worse or just realizing I should or could have just stayed, as this is my first ""career"" job really. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any brutally honest advice, I may be young but I'd rather be given the truth than some sugar sweet beating around the bush. Also, mind you I'm the youngest at my current job as well, so that also seems to be a thing. People not just telling me like it is, going around talking to people in ""secret"" literally only about my 3rd month in few months ago and discussing stuff, and come to find out they think I'm not well prepped. I mean you could have said this in front of me too. Idk it's like so much has been happening in the dark that I wasn't aware of, especially finding out I was lowballed. 

&amp;#x200B;

But maybe this is common in the IT world? Im only 21 so, I'm sure some may read this go ""this is actually common"" but all in all I just really need some advice...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I'm stuck between staying with this job because all they done for me because they looked out for me. Now I feel in debt to them but I dont see any real growth here, its been about half a year now. But I'd almost feel bad for leaving so soon even after all they did.

- Since it is widely used, I tend to sharpen my skills around it. Becoming an expert in the area.
- Potentially could affect work life balance, due to being on call and weekend work. They are working on it by hiring additional staff.

pSykAwtiX-Work,From SysAdmin to Cybersecurity? Looking for some career path recommendations.,"TL; DR:  

I recently quit a stressful system admin position working for a smaller company. I'm looking to pivot into cyber security but I'm not sure which positions to apply for given my generalist IT Support/SysAdmin experience, and what I would need to do to supplement my resume to get me there. Any suggestions, home lab projects, certificates, or ideas would be very welcome.  

Background:  

Over 10 years of IT support/ system admin, always end up as a generalist (miles wide, a couple feet deep). For my last job, I was SysAdmin for a smallish data company for the past four years. This includes managing the Windows IT infrastructure at multiple sites (lots of scripting/automation, AD, Office 365, in-house apps, other systems, all the things, etc) while still handling all the end user help desk support. Always 24/7 on call for everything but network and Linux infrastructure. All while managing multiple simultaneous migration projects, involving dozens of vendors (including contract and financial negotiations) at the same time for the past several years. I also spent a lot of time with devs helping them understand their work flows, how git works, how their code impacts production, long sessions troubleshooting code work-arounds, and offering suggestions to improve efficiency wherever I could.  

Luckily, I had a colleague who was responsible for most of the network and Linux infrastructure. However, my company was just acquired and I found out that he will be leaving. Making me the only IT guy for the whole company going forward. My job will not only remain the same (because they love me so much!), but also will be inheriting the network and Linux infrastructure too, including its 24/7 on call. Don't get me wrong, I love Linux and networking, I've done a decent amount of that too, and I'm always happy for the opportunity to learn more, but... I don't want to be THE guy for everything, all of the time. Once I found out that all my vendor resources are being dissolved indefinitely, along with more migration projects piling on due to the acquisition, I hit my stress limit. I thought it over for a week and put in my two-week notice. Best feeling I've ever felt.  

Why cyber security?  

My instinct right now is to run off into the forest and learn how to live off the land. Maybe get some chickens and a goat. I'm self-taught in just about everything else, why not that too? However, I feel like pivoting my career into anything else would be more financially realistic. I realized a few years ago while studying for Sec+ (didn't take it at the time, felt really basic), that I wouldn't be in IT if it wasn't for my ""unofficial"" pen testing I loved doing so much when I was in elementary/middle/high school. Nothing malicious, just using basic windows login exploits to hide very small (low-graphical, like pong) multiplayer game servers throughout the school network, while net-sending game server login info to other students across the school. Lucky for me, it was the late 90s/early 2000s, nobody really knew what was network security was. Instead of getting in trouble for all the disruption I caused, my ""contributions"" to the file servers would eventually disappear and I'd ""suddenly"", on the same day, get offered a job fixing computers, printers and generally helping IT out wherever I could. I went through this three sperate times in three different school districts. Looking back, I can see that they were just trying to keep my passion busy so I wouldn't get curious and make everybody's jobs more difficult. I'm now 36, been doing IT support ever since thanks to them. Going into cyber security, in some capacity, has a fun full-circle kind of vibe, I like the idea so far.  

Now what?  

I know I've only mentioned pen testing as an example here, but I'm honestly interested in all of it. Google/reddit gives me dozens and dozens of job titles to search for, along with dozens of different opinions on what I need to do to get there. I can easily see myself in a analyst, or security engineer role. Blue team stuff feels a bit too familiar with my last job (PTSD), but I'm sure I'm over simplifying it. Either way, I have no idea where to start narrowing things down. What role(s) would best suit my generalist IT experience? My only constraint is that it needs to be a remote (work-from-home) position.  

If there are any home lab suggestions, let me know. I'm up for any excuse to tinker and learn something new while I enjoy my first vacation in four years. Especially if it helps me get more familiar using industry standard tools. I remember having fun with Kali linux and burp suite many years ago, and I've thought about building a SIEM for my homelab, but that's about as far as my current knowledge and imagination has taken me so far.

Chansharp,Make them tell you no. 50% raise because I applied for something I was unqualified for.,"I just got a job as a sysadmin for which I am entirely unqualified and it's all because I applied.

I got my net+ certificate out of high school, got hired as an intern then taken on full time as a made up IT generalist position. I would help the network team, the support team, and the uc team. After a couple years my role became more specific and I was changed to desktop support and I focused on phones. Due to a less than satisfactory raise this year I started looking for employment elsewhere at which point I applied for a system administrator position that had a lot of requirements I didn't meet. 2 interviews later I get the job. I was honest on my resume and during the interviews, I only have a surface level understanding of the technologies and my net+ cert is years expired but I am a quick study and I work well with a team. I never would have received this amazing opportunity if I had been afraid to apply because the posting required a degree and x years experience with y technology.

justadamnfool,Ready to move on beyond Network Tech and looking for some guidance,"I have been a data center network technician for a number of years now, primarily working on layer 1 and I feel like I have learned all I can in this role and am ready for something more. My issue is that I'm a bit conflicted on where to go next and could use some advice or guidance from anyone who may have been in a similar position at some point in their career. 

The only cert I hold is a Fiber Optic Association cert that my company requires all techs obtain, it has no value beyond really just being a talking point for my employer so I don't have to worry about getting it renewed. I purchased materials for the Sec+ and CCNA and have been studying for the Sec+ just to get some sort of relevant cert to add to my resume and I plan to pursue the CCNA mostly because I've been genuinely interested in it for some time and it seems like a logical step to take based on my current experience.

I'm in my mid 30s and my ultimate goal is the find a networking position that will take me out of the physical layer all together since the physical labor aspect of it is not something I want to do rolling into my 40s. My last supervisor told me it's a good idea for me to pursue a degree as well (not necessarily in IT) mainly just to make myself more attractive on job searches so I've been looking into a few of the programs at WGU.

I work pretty close with the network team here, especially since we’re transitioning to SIP. I was honestly just looking for a little experience in the working world and then transition to a more networking/security field. But here I am almost 3 years in and I’ve been looking for a change. Without using hardly any of the info sec knowledge from college over the past few years, I’ve practically forgotten all of the details that jobs would ask me now. So I’m looking to study and get either network+ or security+. Would it be a waste to take a full boot camp? How is telecommunications typically viewed inside of IT? At my company, we are not part of our MIS team, but work closely with them. If I just get a cert and go on interviews would telecom experience be accepted? Personally i would like to study myself, get my security+ and get a job as an analyst or something and go from there.

1)MSP, 2 on-site/3 remote. Support/imaging with Azure/Intune, some cybersecurity baked into role. 

2)Prod ops role, tickets investigating broken data. SQL queries, some powershell scripting, VBA scripting. 100% remote.

Both will likely be very similar salary ranges. #2 likely a more relaxed environment; I have a feeling I'll work like a dog for the MSP, but I'm wondering of the experience opportunities are worth the work flow.

RawOystersOnIce,Started new remote cybersecurity job a week ago and have done almost nothing since starting. Manager seems to busy/preoccupied to speak with me and is unsure what to have me doing. Haven't met any other members of the team. How worried should I be?,"On 2/7 I started a new remote IT position where I am making almost double what I made at my previous position. The position is with a very well know cyber security company and I was really excited to start. On 2/7 I spent all day in online orientation with HR and legal department. My only instructions for the following day was to wait for my manager to reach out to me. On 2/8 nobody reached out to me the first half of the day, so I sent my new manager a message on Teams. He welcomed me to the team and we had a brief 30 minute video call, during the call he said he was surprised the HR department has nothing else planned for me for the week as he apparently thought orientation was a week long process and he didn't need to do anything with me the first week. The only instructions he gave me were to watch some internal training videos that the company has on our intranet, which is basically all I have been doing. He did not give any instructions on what specific videos to watch, so I have been just watching videos about what I think are relevant to the position. On 2/9 me and my manager had one more hour long meeting where he just went over the company structure and some upcoming news about the company. He then stated he will send me another calendar invite for another meeting the next day, but I never received an invite so on 2/10 and 2/11 I basically did nothing except watched training videos.

On 2/14 I sent my manager another message asking me what he wanted me to do this week and he said he will send me a calendar invite for another meeting, but as of 2/15 I still have not received any invite so again I am doing nothing yesterday and today except watching videos.

So basically I am concerned about my position due to the lack of communication and the fact that I am basically doing nothing right now. I know it takes time to become a full member of a team in a new position, but at my last position I was basically already performing my job function within one week of starting, here I feel like nobody know what I am suppose to be doing or are to busy to give direction. I look at my manager's Outlook calendar and see that his entire day is marked as ""busy"" every day, so I am sure he is very preoccupied, but still this is very concerning isn't it?",ITCareerQuestions,1,1644938262

I have a dilemma. I have a job as a field tech doing hardware repair. I love this job like no other but I know there is little room for growth, in salary and opportunity for vertical movement. I'll probably be doing the same thing I'm doing now 10 years from now. I have an opportunity to get a job that will involve desk top support combined with field work, but the field work will not involve hardware repair at all, just stuff like swapping devices, fixing simple printer problems.

Technically
I’ve been studying passively for a year now with both.
When I first discovered these certificates I had two jobs(one was in a technology store) so I didn’t have time to dive deep into either one. I’ve been familiar with technology a little bit…mainly printers.
I’ve read the entire Exam Cram for Network + and watched all of professor Messer videos and some more. At the time I was doing this a recruiter told me I should get the A+ first. So I went back to studying that, and now I’m halfway through it. (I’m just reviewing the 1001)
But my debate right now is 


The Network + retires in June

But I’m halfway through the A+

Should I finish studying the A+ and then study the Network +

Or should I stop studying the a+ now and go back to the network +?

My only worry is I won’t have time for both with my new job which is making me lean towards the Network + since it’s just 1 exam instead of 2 parts.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1644926780

I am currently stuck with a weird scenario. I am 22 years old and have received two job offers, one is for Amazon OpsTech where I will work as a Support Engineer. The second as a part of a Web Development team for a decent sized company. 

Both jobs are about the same distance away from my house with the Web Dev position paying $1 less an hour. I have no certifications or degree other than a few projects on my GitHub and 2 previous years of IT support experience (1 at a MSP, 1 in house). I am wondering what position may be beneficial towards my future career, I do love coding but I also love networking and working with hardware. My friend was saying I should look at climbing the Amazon ladder towards an AWS DevOps position while working towards my CS degree since Amazon has a tuition reimbursement for some schools. Though I have another friend who works as a SWE that says I should take the development position and stay for 1.5 - 2 years before using that experience to leverage a higher paying salary. Either of these positions would be great experience on my resume for the future but I still struggle to choose one.

I am blessed to have been given both of these opportunities but I do not want to feel like I may have made the wrong choice in choosing an offer. If anyone has some sort of similar experience or guidance/insight on what field may lead to better positions in the future I would be happy to hear.

I was just looking to gain some insight as to what my day to day might look like. In the interview, the guy and I really clicked. 

He mentioned they get swamped with new product setups, he said usually the purchasing department put in their own products. He said they have some complicated pricing, looking for someone to set products up the right way with pricing.

“New product setups. Products change all the time, vendors change, they come out with new products, they update their products. We’re constant setting up new product number, description, weights and units, assigning pricing records…assigning different types of units.

PC troubleshooting, that’s another one. Either something’s wrong with the wireless connection or they can’t, for some reason, get into our software, which is browser based. We use Google chrome to access our application, so sometimes the cache needs emptied or whatever.

On top of that, we have to do updates in pricing in the system. Sometimes the vendors send us update sheets in excel or txt or other formats, multiple formats. We have to get that data into a format that our system recognizes so we can update the pricing. 

We have an automated job that runs—so we have to put it in a certain format and then we schedule it and the system grabs it and updates the pricing. But sometimes there’s a lot of prep work getting it into that format. Mostly done in excel.”

Also, what are V-lookups? He asked me if I know how to do V lookups. Is this difficult to learn? 


I have a feeling I will be using excel a bunch also. Does anyone have a recommendation for relearning excel? Like Udemy or YouTube?

I worked with Unity for 2 years before I decided to move on and study Python. I fell in love with that language and I decided to apply for the role ""Python developer"".

I got the offer for Junior role with a pretty low salary. And for 5 months, there is not a single day I am assigned to work with Python. At first, they told me there is no project, and assigned me to fix a broken old project which was written from NodeJs. 

I thought it was a challenge, I tried so hard to learn NodeJs next to python at night, and for 3 months when I am done with it. They told me to continue doing another project with NodeJs, I felt terrible but I tried again.

And one month with NodeJs, the manager again told me to work with Typescript and Ruby for a new coming project, I knew why they pushed me around, they wanted to get money from completing all the projects, I felt so fucked up. Again, I tried to study it and I am the only one can work with Typescript in my company at the moment.

When it comes to Ruby, I feel ""That's it!""

There is not a single day I am assigned to any Python project, and in that goddamn room, the Python team is still running with new projects every month, I was hired to be one of them, and I am never be the one. There is also an internship that he works for 6 months with python and is unpaid.

I was in some projects that I am the main developer, when this was the first time I study all the things above alone, no seniors, no support, nothing, low salary and some forceful funny activities that cost me money and time which is nobody-wanted.

And my team leader, he doesn't know anything, at all!! He doesn't even know that Node is a framework of JS (I studied this myself in November), and he thought NodeJS is a different language with JS! When I asked him to ask the customer about some ideas, he accepted, then later he answered me with ""I am not sure... A? or B? I don't even know"". How the fuck I am going to know what to code?

The problem is, I am afraid that if I quit, I might get no job and it will lower my chance to work with python in the future, because 5 months of working is pretty short of time. I don't know anyone who works under 5 months either. One side of me telling me to work fore at least 2-3 months more to have good CV, I don't even know what to put on my cv? Work as python developer but the list of things I have done is all about typescript, nodejs?

ventek07,Big 4 Tech Risk to Small Tech GRC Role - Need advice!,"Hi all,

Currently a tech risk Staff 2 (Acting Senior) at Big 4. I Have been here for almost 2 years and all i do is IT audit and SOC reporting.

Now I do not like IT Audit. I also Have always wanted to move to more technical space since i have technical skills too.

I recently got an offer from a Web hosting Company as a Senior Analyst in their Security GRC practice. The role is still IT Risk which will also involve  risk assessments around Cloud computing as well. Basically they recently started SOC2 certification, ISO27 as well as PCI DSS. The GRC team is small as well, currently has 5 employees but they’re housed under Full Engineering security domain. They are based out of Texas with office in Europe too. The role is also Remote so i wont have to move.

The company isn’t Big Tech but it is pre-IPO so they’re on their way for an IPO in few years. They also have had funding from one of the biggest global equity companies in the world. We’re talking 200 million plus! Their yearly revenue has grown too, in fact north of $200 million. They’re also not typical web hosting website providers but they offer more solutions as well. Their web hosting solutions also scale cloud environments as well especially azure, aws and GCP.

Now im not sure if this is worth it? The role is still in Risk but specifically around GRC and Information security. The money is wayyy better too (115 K) whereas staff 2 is paid peanuts (current TC is 80 K in NYC). I was interviewing for Analyst role but they’ve offered me a Senior Role.

Im mainly confused because the Company is small, around 10 years old but has grown from being a Start up and now has close to 1000 employees all over the world. So I’ll be making a jump from Big 4 to a smaller tech company. Plus, i had thought id get the experience and jump from Big4 to Big Tech.

Should i take the offer and hope to move to more technical role in big tech in future?

Or just try for more technical roles and kiss this GRC security role goodbye? Or should i just stay?",ITCareerQuestions,1,1644898251

ApolloAdmin,Very Torn on Job Offer Wondering If I should Take it,"So a little bit ago I posted about a job offer I was going to receive well I officially got it but am very torn on it 

The offer is for about 5K over my currently salary however I do very well at my current job (six figures) so money was not my main driving factor for looking for a new job. 

The good parts about my new potential role: 

*Much Bigger Environment and learning potential 
*More Benefits (some being slightly worse then current job) but I would be getting a lot more here then I currently have access to 
*Slightly More Money
*Signing Bonus

Cons:
*No Guarantee of a regular yearly bonus
*No 401K Profit Sharing (Still get a match but at my current job get a Match &amp; Profit Sharing) 

Another reason why I'm really considering it is im bored at my current role and we are pushing more and more server to our vendors hosting SaaS offerings so what I manage is shrinking so worried if I don't move my skills won't keep pace with the industry. At this new company that will not be an issue as they are very large (F500).",ITCareerQuestions,1,1644893743

The business is a private spa/resort in California and he told me that it entails providing end users with IT support. He seemed to be intrigued when I mentioned that I built a virtual lab on my gaming pc setup /dabbling with AD &amp; GPO.

I'm super nervous for the interview because I tend to have imposter syndrome. Is there anyone here who has worked a similar role for hospitality/hotel businesses like this? If so, what technical areas should I brush up on before the interview takes place?

Currently I'm trying to recreate a spa/hotel enterprise server setup to prepare myself. Does anyone have any tips or pointers? Apologies if I am being incredibly vague. 

Lastly, being that I have no prior professional IT experience and certs (I am currently studying and finishing up a google IT &amp; comptia A+ cert while in an undergrad program for IT management) is $50k a year too much to ask for?

Hossaam47,Is it possible to get into an IT career without any certifications?,"Hello there.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 24 years old, graduated with an Electrical Engineering degree with Computer Engineering as a minor. I mostly took Communication and Programming courses during college so my fundamentals in both are decent. The thing is, I don't have a specific aspect where I can say I am more than average at.

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly I graduated in the spring of 2020, and the job market in my region (MENA) was awful to say the least. It was hard, super super hard to get even an internship as a help desk in IT due to the fact everybody was laying off people to cope with the pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time to keep myself busy, I took on a few internships that are non-IT related to see how the world works in a more professional scope. But now even after almost 2 years of graduating I didn't even land a single helpdesk interview even though I tweaked my resume to the best way I possibly can (I can say that am confident in this as my second resume is successful landing me interviews but in different field.

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, I noticed a trend in job postings. They all need EXTENSIVE knowledge &amp; experience in these fields: Cloud, Linux, DevOps, SQL, Networking, Python, Java, Security and VMware all in an entry level position! 

&amp;#x200B;

I do have transferable skills from my previous work experiences, but I didn't make that enough money to get any certifications in these areas. My current skillset doesn't even take half of the requirements (I am pretty confident in my networking knowledge and my Python, C++, Java and SQL to be even tested at).

&amp;#x200B;

I am not by any means trying to make any excuses or vent about the job market. I just need help or advice in what should I do or where do I get started as I am near my wits end. Some suggested the A+ certification, others said to dedicate yourself to on of these skills and see if you pursue a career in (cloud computing for example). Other than constantly applying for entry level helpdesks and internships I do some programming projects, revise my networking principles, and study off free resources on cloud computing (mainly AWS) to keep myself in the loop of things.

GamesMusicWeed,How do you best broach the subject of work/life balance in a job interview?,"I’m reasonably happy where I am currently as the solo IT person. I’ve been getting great experiences, lots of freedom/autonomy, and I’ve been growing as person. 

Another thing I’ve really been enjoying is the great work/life balance. I’m not expected to be on call after hours, though I do put in extra here and there when I feel it is required. The key thing with this however, is that when I work on systems outside of regular hours, it’s because I *choose* to as a matter of pride in my IT environment. 

That being said, the job market for IT people in my area is extremely hot right now and my peers are making 30% - 40% more than me. I’ve had a couple of recruiters reach out with roles that are also in the same ballpark.

While I have emailed my boss to ask if there is room to talk about a raise to “more closely match market conditions”, I’ve decided that I’d be open to look around at opportunities. I’m not in a hurry and feel that I can afford to pick the right opportunity if it comes along. 

Im fine putting in extra hours occasionally when it’s needed, but I’m not looking for to move for more money if it means consistently working 60 hours a week.  All I want is to be paid a bit closer to what I’m actually worth, while working for an employer who cares about the work/life balance of their employees. 

I’ve been researching (mainly on YouTube) to learn general tips and advice from recruiters, but I’d love to hear feedback from people in the IT field on how that subject is broached in an interview. I’m a dedicated and hard worker, I just don’t want to be taken advantage of and burnt out. Im particularly sensitive to that due to past experiences and I’m sure many people here can relate. 

My main concern though is that recruiters and interviewers will see me as a “clock watcher” when all I’m really asking for is for my personal life to be respected.

I'm pretty content where I'm currently at, I like the people, but I'm at a terminal point/plateau as far as responsibility/career here and I'm trying to figure out where to head in the next year or so before my contentment sours.

I've currently been a doing a blend of implementation as an IC and leading architecture design of our org's move to Azure. This includes building PoCs, taking compliance requirements and either planning or implementing controls on our environments, incubating new technology and transferring to ops and security teams, interfacing/managing efforts of our vendors and operations teams as they work on cloud-related projects, etc. While my title says Cloud Architect, I honestly feel more Sr. Cloud Engineer 70ish% of the time, and architect design/evangelist the rest.

**Question**
I *think* I want to eventually get into a role that focuses on leadership and architecture/strategy. I enjoy collaborating with people, coming up with a plan and then figuring out what/how to push people and tech to get there. That said, I don't know the best way to get there from where I'm at now.

In either case, I don't know the best path forward on either of these. Do I pick up TOGAF and other architecture framework training to continue that path? Should I be getting a PMP or management training to go down that way?

I’m really struggling, I’ve got a few certs azure administrator and a few others but my motivation and currently daily routine is killing any desire for development and my career. 

My job is very much hit and miss, the majority of any real technical work is done by our architects in the cloud space so I don’t any real customer work just support the overall infrastructure so the overall workload is minimal. 

I log on from home, connect up and attend relevant teams calls but generally the work comes and goes and not enough for me to pick up passions in things because everything is built or any new work is done by the next team.

I mentioned my salary increasing and I’m pretty comfortable now and I felt it’s just killed the motivation to do better along with my job tasks. 

Structure and management don’t really create an environment for development ( I do understand the need to be ambitious and hard working on your own) there isn’t anyone really identifying skills or weaknesses or providing that mentoring that I think I would enjoy. 

I’m lacking a few skills if I’m honest I don’t know powershell, my networking is rusty, scripting non Existent and my azure skills are dropping each day because I’m not building things anymore.

I massively overthink everything and I’m smart enough to know that maybe the job is the problem but I’m finally on a salary that’s amazing and I also have a little one on the way to support so I just want to try and better myself. 

I used to be a very hardworking person, certification oriented, did on call and enjoyed face to face interaction but because my strengths aren’t being utilised I feel like I’m going back a step.

I’ve worked and worked for a low salary and I’ve finally got good money coming in but I’m so bored and unmotivated. 

Please go easy on me I get I might sound like a broken record but Just getting a bit desperate feels like I’ve been this way for 3 years now. 

I like working from home but it probably hasn’t helped when the jobs boring.

RedFortress10,"Interview for my First IT job, looking for some advice please","Hi there

As the Subject title states I've got my First interview for a Tech Support position working for a Fibre Broadband provider. I really want this job to get my foot in the door with the IT industry so was just wanting to ask the people of this amazing subreddit what shall I expect? What questions are likely to be asked of me and what questions could I ask them? Is there anything specific I should do or say for the interview? Any and all advice, tips will be greatly appreciated. Thank you :)",ITCareerQuestions,1,1644860987

Intelligent-Mark3901,Do you take certs for the knowledge you obtain or for its implicit value?,"I just came up with this GNS3 certificate that I had never heard about. Apart from the sections specific to how GNS3 works I felt the contents behind the cert were quite good with some python, Ansible and Linux included. I know certs are nothing compared to experience but what's your drive on a cert? Actual knowledge or just recognition. 

I feel this is the same with the Devnet and GSEC certs that I wanted to take. Although they have things I wanna learn just by checking their influence on LinkedIn in my area I get depressed lol. The Devnet just shows 6 result which are all jobs from cisco. The GSEC shows a whopping 14...

ScotchMalone,Advice with transitioning from working in Audio Visual (AV) into IT,"**BACKGROUND:** Currently I work as a service engineer with AV systems which basically is the same as IT helpdesk tier 2 or 3. I've also worked with building systems and some design work within the field. In case people aren't aware, at this point everything in the AV space has become networked which means I have done pretty close to the job of a Sys Admin.

When our clients have issues it's almost always one of 3 things: Hardware failure needs RMA'd, Network config issue on their end, or user error. So more often then not I am working directly with network management and things like that. All in all, I feel pretty confident in my skills around computer systems and networking but it can take some effort to show the skills transfer.

Right now I am in the process of getting the CompTIA big 3 as well as looking at getting some certs for Cisco starting with the CCNA. If all goes well I should have those 4 in the next six months as I don't expect there to be much of a knowledge gap to learn based on what I've studied so far.

The main reason for trying to shift into IT is I am concerned of getting stuck in AV without upward growth in pay. IT obviously has such a wide cross-section and is only becoming more critical. Right now I make \~$45k and if push came to shove I could take a pay cut but I would really hate to take a step back unless it was a clear springboard opportunity.

**QUESTIONS:** 

* For people who have made a mid career shift like this, what was most helpful to avoiding taking a step backwards?
* Any suggestions on how to present my resume to better reflect my IT skillset as my work history doesn't directly reflect my experience with IT systems?
* I have an interest in security and systems management, what would be some good job options to focus my search towards given my experience (think helpdesk)?",ITCareerQuestions,1,1644857909
SativaSammy,Should I Stay put for longer or test the market AGAIN?,"I'm approaching the 4 year mark of my IT career and my jobs and pay have been as follows:

DogTop198,"Making 6 figures as IT support, but not happy and secure...help! next step?","Hi all,

Long story short I grinded my butt off as a contractor for a great company doing desktop support for a few years. I finally got hired full time and am making GREAT money and benefits. The workload is so light now I can really put in the time to learn something useful. 

The problem is...I cant figure out the actual steps/ or path to take here and study/self teach so I could use some guidance. I am not a developer/programmer but I would like to get into something more technical or server level perhaps.

I have the time and money to take paid courses if that makes most sense? But I wouldnt have the confidence to do that since I am so unsure of what I want to do.

 I have an interest in many of the things above Desktop Support such as .... IT security, Windows Server , Intune/Autopilot, JAMF, powershell, Azure. But I am completely lost other than thinking these technologies are ""cool"" as all I have done is hand out new laptops,set up peripherals, reinstall software etc. you know all the Desktop Support stuff at an office.

 I am very confident I have a higher ceiling than that but if I am not practicing these technologies for work how can I learn them? I do not want to quit my job as the benefits are incredible and I have kids.  I could really use a mentor and I have have some awesome hardware at home to homelab if needed. Without quitting my crazy lucrative job though I am not sure I will ever learn anything new. My biggest fear is that if I get laid off I will be right back working for an MSP doing tickets all day because I still have no real technical skills. Preparing for the future and getting out of a customer facing customer service role is my priority. I am so sick of this type of role it just isnt going to end well if I dont prepare yesterday.

DumplingTree_,What’s my next step to keep growing? Besides the degree.,"Good afternoon folks,
I’ve been studying IT since high school, currently going into my Jr year of college. I finished an AA in network technologies this month and I’m moving into a bachelors in Cyber Sec. I have some experience doing desktop support for small companies, I did a couple internships, and I’m currently in a full time roll as a network technician for MFPs (printers…ugh) while I continue my education. This summer I’d like to do some independent study and grab my first certification. I went through the Cisco Netacad at my college and really loved CCNA, however that was almost a year ago and to take that test it’ll require some serious studying. Another option is Net+, which will require far less studying but I feel holds less weight. I’m stuck as to which one to focus on. Outside of this, I feel I should be moving into a broader helpdesk role to keep learning at work. Printers have about 3 functions and in the 9 months I’ve been doing it I feel like I’m plateauing.

•	Yes, your non-related bachelors degree is useful to have - you don't need to go back and get a technical bachelors/masters
•	Yes, you can be successful without a degree

•	Yes, you will be more successful and have an easier time if you do have a degree

•	Given the choice, pick a non-security degree. Degrees should be general. If you're not sure, go with Computer Science - it's the most flexible tech degree you can get

•	Start with the CompTIA certs if you don't know what to do

•	No one cares that you built your own PC. That's not something you'll experience as an IT professional

•	There are no jobs that are guaranteed to always be remote

•	There are no specialties that are more likely to get you a fully remote job

•	If you live in a somewhat rural area, you might have to move to get a job

•	Yes, you'll probably have to start at a helpdesk / desktop support / L1 role. This is by far the highest volume of need within IT

•	Yes, the money is good if you're good at your job. You can move up quickly if you're good at your job

•	There are no jobs that will guarantee you $x salary in y years

•	There are no certifications, degrees or other credentials that will guarantee you a job

Natural-Nectarine-56,Career Move From System Admin to DevOps or Cybersecurity?,"Hi Everyone,

I've been in IT for quite a long time. In and out of tech-based roles pretty much my whole life. I've been a System Admin for the last eight years. I've worked for a few small MSPs and about two years ago moved into an internal position that is essentially becoming the senior admin. All of the environments I've worked with are Windows-based, with little to no experience with OSX or Linux. Virtualizations are small VMware clusters and hyper-v hosts with a few VMs. I've also done some big refresh projects. It's hard to sum up my experience in a few lines, but that's the gist of it.

I've decided to go back to school via WGU, and I initially started as a Cybersecurity major. I've now been reconsidering that direction, and I'm thinking about going into the Cloud Computing role, which focuses more on cloud-hosted tech and DevOps.

I'm torn as to where I should start shifting my skill set. I find both exciting and wonder which has a higher salary cap and more available positions. I'm also really wanting remote jobs.

nuride,Need advice about first job. Am I crazy or should I run?,"Hello all, 

Here's the situation:  I completed my A+ cert last month, and was lucky (I thought) to get into an entry level helpdesk/desktop support role at a smallish, localish company of roughly 1500 some odd employees. However things do not seem to be going well. Our helpdesk/desktop support team is comprised of 5 people: Our admin, whos been with the company 7 years; our team lead, whos been with the company for 5; another newer guy who's only been there for 2 months; a remote employee on the other side of the company; and myself. There is also 1 systems admin, and 1 network admin. 

This is changing Monday. Our IT team supports a healthcare company, and while our group is technically a separate entity, the CIO has decided we have to abide by the mandate. I don't want to get into opinions on that, I simply want to illustrate why I am in this predicament.  Because of this, our Admin and Team Lead are being forced out, leaving myself at 3 weeks into my first IT job, and one other newer guy in the office to support a 1500+ employee company across multiple locations. The systems and network admins have told us they'll do everything they can to support us but they have an overflowing plate as it is.

I find myself looking at the prospect of having to handle a mountain of work, enough for half a dozen people or more, with only one other primary team member who is as untrained as I for all intents and purposes, and no one to continue training us, at a company that has a dozen systems that have little in the way of documentation or standardized practices... in my first IT job. To make matters worse, our CIO hasn't said a word to my other inexperienced colleague or I about any kind of transition plan. Heck he hasn't even asked if we think we are going to be able to handle it or what we think we might need in order to continue to function. At best it seems uncommunicative, and a bit naïve or ignorant on his part to just how much we'll have to try and cover. At worst it seems cold, callous, and apathetic.

Everything inside me is telling me to get as far away from this as I can. That this is a poorly managed department and that there is little to no foresight into keeping us functional as a team, and the absolute chaos that is about to ensue will turn into a raging dumpster fire in short order. 

Am I the crazy one here?",ITCareerQuestions,1,1644791020

Chiiffy,Leave big/stable company for smaller startup to break into Cloud?,"Hi guys, I recently got my AWS SAA cert and have been doing tech support for around 4 years for a large Fortune 500 company. I recently got an interview offer for a junior cloud role at a smaller startup that has won numerous awards for my area (best startup, brightest, etc), but I’m unsure if I should go because of my concerns about work life balance and pay. The reviews for the company look great and seem to say benefits/work life balance are good, but I know from just being a startup there could be naturally more of an imbalance/pressure dynamic there. Also, the pay according to Glassdoor looks like it could be low for the area, and my currently salary of around 60k may be too high or on the cusp of the roles limit, putting the pressure on me. 

My current company is a great one but opportunities to move out of Service Desk seem rare and hard to get into, but if I did get a position it would be a much better salary with better benefits/stability. I’m just torn because I’m so sick of Service Desk but I don’t want to leave here and make the wrong decision. Any advice?",ITCareerQuestions,1,1644770916
andyh3476,Currently conflicted with what I want to do in the future,"Hi. I'm currently 20 y/o and finishing up my A.S. IT degree at NOVA right now (it was in A.S. as I was planning on transferring but I did not want to go to school anymore and I already wasted 3 years at NOVA and I'm afraid of wasting more time and my parents support me anymore) and I've been reading up posts in this subreddit on whether or not I need a bachelor's degree to make it into companies. And right now, I'm currently conflicted if I should pursue in the bachelor's or just go straight to completing certs and getting a entry level job. 

I do not have much experience in IT. Only experience I have is building computers and no experience on the software side. I don't like coding at all and basically software as I find that to be confusing and hard to understand so I'm going for a IT job that's hardware and I don't know career name that is.

 So basically, do I need a bachelor's in order for me to live financially stable and is there a IT job where I'm working on the hardware side of IT? 

No experience in IT, no certs as of now and I have no done any internships yet.",ITCareerQuestions,1,1644770560

MisterPuffyNipples,Is this considered a toxic work environment? [Venting],"I'm L1 helpdesk and I feel like I'm learning nothing which is ironic considering I'm supposed to be wearing many hats. Here are a few examples  of the environment and why I'm learning very little and also why I'm stressed out to capacity 

A user calls to say she needs access to an old account. I look the account up in AD and it's disabled. Command Prompt says the password expired in 2019. There's no knowledge base or any documentation so I don't even know where to begin. This particular day there was no one to ask directly. Other days the answers I get are brief because there's 4 technicians and 4000 users.  I tell her I'll try to find someone from the team who can help. Later, I see a note from the network admin about accessing a different email address and this old account is getting its emails forwarded to this other address. The caller calls back after seeing  this email and says it's still not accessible, she needs access to the actual account and a whole bunch of other questions I can't answer because I don't know. She sounds like she's on the verge of tears because she can't do her job without access. I reach out to the network admin with the hope he will contact her. But now I feel bad because I couldn't do anything to help

 Another failed call. 


Next we have what should have been a simple call but again without any resources I'm essentially helpless. I do have notes but they only go so far. Anyway this guy just wants a password reset. Now we all know that's easy. Find the user in AD and reset  his password, right? WRONG

The infrastructure of this place is a nightmare. Even IF that was the solution first you have to find out what location they're in because there's a remote server list depending on if they're on our server or not. But there's no way to know if their location matches the locations mentioned in the remote  server list 

Then the question is what password are they resetting? Email? Desktop? Laptop? Does reseating one change them all? Are they on VPN? Anyway I try just to reset it in AD but it has no affect. Later a L3 contacts the user with instructions on how to change his password. And they basically say to login and go to settings and from there you can....wait....login? How do they login if they don't know their password? 

I ask the L3 this in chat. He says nothing.

I don't know how much longer I can do this",ITCareerQuestions,1,1644768020

VegaGT-VZ,Looking to make more $$$. Should I stick with BI or start pivoting to software/web development?,"I'm a financial analyst with a lot of comfort in VBA &amp; SQL. In my current role I took a reporting system that was all manual copy + paste of spreadsheets and I automated everything. Right now I'm migrating that reporting system from Excel worksheets to Power BI dashboards and enjoying the process.

I would like to make more money, but I don't want to get into management. It looks like there are better paying IC roles for BI stuff I know I can do, but I think I have a good enough grasp of basic programming concepts that I can pick up other languages and move into software/web development where there's a lot more demand and $$$. 

Other wrinkle is I work for a good company with the best boss I've ever had. So it's going to suck to leave that. But I'm already bumping the ceiling of pay in this role, and once I migrate the reporting to PBI I probably won't have much to do besides keep the machine running. I'm going to need another challenge.

Cephalon_Zeash,Sysadmin VS Devops for a highschooler looking to specialize (in a general sense) early on,"As a highschooler looking into various technologies regarding deployment and management of servers, be it in the cloud, a virtualized environment or even bare metal, I want to specialize (in a very general sense) in some branch of IT. Looking into the most popular ones I came to these observations:

- Networking = something I'll inevitably learn (at least the basics) as I'm learning for other areas, so I won't focus on it too much yet


- Security = not really my cup of tea as far as I can tell

- Storage/DB administration = kind of like networking

- System administration = definitely something I'm interested in

- DevOps = same here


I'm interested in your thoughts on the main differences between these 2, as well as their benefits and drawbacks. From what I know, DevOps is mostly present in newer companies/companies that want to advance, making it quite appealing in that regard. Then again, ""classic"" sys administration is still extremely popular, which is why I'm on the fence about this choice.

Thanks for your help.
